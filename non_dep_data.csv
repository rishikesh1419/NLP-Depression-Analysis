Occasional gaming: it's nice to absorb into a more sensory active world when I just can't get into a book. (Or I'm procrastinating my Spanish lessons no por favor jajaja)

He requested me to give him the ice cream, but in my culture it is not acceptable to give something half-eaten to someone. So I said no.

He then requested money, but I had heard talks of how young boys like him were using that money for drugs. So I was reluctant. He requested for a few more seconds then stopped.

I had only taken two to three steps when I thought why not get him an ice cream. I turned around to do so, but it was like the boy had vanished.

Now, whenever I think about the boy I see hunger on his face, I don't know why I couldn't see it then.

I didn't even ask to see her messenger so that was quite a clear sign of evasion. I said okay, give me the phone then. She immediately turned hostile and wouldn't give it to me. At that point I didn't even need to check it.

My dumb ass forgave her for it though. But things were never the same after that and we broke up eventually because of that and several other trust issues. So the last sentence in your comment can't be truer! Love dun matter if you can't trust each other.",2020-04-10 14:09:59

And it’s hard to describe, but a key change is when a song changes from one base “key” to one above it. Super common in pop songs from the mid-seventies to the early 2000’s. It was a trend that’s unfortunately died out. 

But a good example of this is is ‘Surfer Girl’ by The Beach Boys - https://youtu.be/lHNcMs8W660 - it happens between 1:25 and 1:40 of the song. You can tell the key changes because there’s a sort of ‘lift’ in the music that goes from one key to another.

fmz58wl,"This doesn't have a NSFW tag, so I will go with a joke I posted a couple weeks back the last time it was asked.

A man dies and it is the day of his funeral. There is a large turnout because he was a pillar of the community. There, in the front row, was his widow, along with his best friend, whom he knew since they were in Kindergarten.

After the minister gives a touching eulogy he opens the lecturn to anybody who wishes to say something about the dearly departed. The best friend turns to the widow and asks if he could say a word. She says, ""Yes, of course"".

The best friend makes his way to the lecturn; once there, he puts his glasses on as he reaches into his breast pocket. He withdraws a folded note card which he then carefully smoothens out on the lecturn. He clears his throat, leans in slightly towards the microphone and says, ""Plethora"". He then replaces the note card in his pocket, doffs his glasses and returns to his seat.

The widow takes his hand in hers and says, ""That means a lot.""",2020-04-10 13:51:36

Hence those who are qualified for the particular task would be thoroughly trained to abstain from such inclinations, consequently removing such thoughts ' one would never say to a patient '. Within psychological treatments, there is never a 'want' from the clinician, all methods, advice and medicine are based on solid scientific evidence.

It is indeed unfortunate such individuals live like this, they must also handle the potential side effects and long term detriments cognitively that such drugs may inflict over such heavy intake. However there is a light to this tunnel as my field of Cognitive Neuroscience are now producing biological treatments that involve deep brain stimulation using electrodes in affected areas to manipulate synaptic systems to say, reduce obsessions of with who suffers with OCD, it is hoped these treatments may take place of drugs in severe cases and as the NHS are more funded, more accessible to all.",2020-04-10 14:02:47

It is a strenuous process, currently I am on a project to identify individual gene markers for OCD patients.
Individual genes such as gene 9, COMT and SERT seem to be present however there are as many as 230 genes that may be involved with the development of OCD suggesting the disorder is polygenetic. If however the phenotype is influenced by more than one gene, if technology enables genetic editing, we could potentially erase disorders by identifying gene markers present or indicative of future disorders at an early age. 

However this is all mostly wishful thinking, with the pandemic now requiring my workplace as a temporary hospital, such progress/research is delayed :(",2020-04-10 14:14:33

The other member is a procrastinator, but they've also contributed ideas and have formed the basis of our assessment. This third member expressed concerns about our lack of work and how we had very little time before it was due. I understood this very well, and offered to complete the work to compensate the other two, and she was happy with that. That night, I spent hours working on our task (some drama performance), writing scripts, getting resources, adding ideas, etc.

Apparently, I was taking control of the group and not letting anyone contribute, as was made clear to me by a student the third group member was talking to.

fmz3jj6,"As with all things, it depends on your interests.  In my limited experience, Yosemite is the most grand and awe inspiring if you can get on the trails and out of the valley floor though that is amazing enough if you have limited mobility.  The problem with Yosemite is crowds, many of whom are just, let's say, not nature buffs (when I was there, the outdoor bar did an excessively brisk business). 

Zion is Yosemite in red. Also crowded, also requires you to get off the beaten path, but it is easier there.  Yellowstone is amazing but huge.  None of those will disappoint.  

Having said all that, my favorite is Arches.  If you like desertscapes and marveling at the result of incomprehensible timeframes, that is the place. I imagine that many people will say ""Ah it's just rocks."" but ... wow.    Joshua Tree NP is another desert wonder well worth the effort (and again, some people might say it's just rocks.   

Others to recommend: Mt Saint Helens (hike through Ape Cave - an old lava tube) & any of the Utah parks - those have great State parks nearby too.

>There are also a lot of pedos out in the streets. Is it justifiable to you to never let your kid out alone, visit friends (parents might harass them) or meet relatives (the ones that statically harass the most) to avoid them being harassed?

Much less likely, pedos aren't that confident, and prefer the internet. On top of that, as long as they stay in public, and large groups, they should be fine. As for relatives, be vigilant, have them stick around trusted adults, usually of the same sex. Stay in constant contact with your child.

I’ve always had a good head on me and grew up earlier than my friends because of past experiences. 

I agree it is case by case, and only if you suspect your child is in serious trouble, but if you just want to complain about them to other people and act like you never invaded their privacy, it’s time for some self reflection. I was so angry because I know my mum didn’t have my best interests at heart, I still firmly believe snooping is bad, but if kids are refusing all other methods of parenting, I can see why some parents may do it.

Child nudes

Drugs

Gangs

Depression and suicide

During this time, he started telling people he found out he's adopted...  We didn't take him seriously at all.  If you'd met his decidedly and malignantly narcissistic parents, you'd understand his lying too.  We all hated his parents.  One of us fought his dad directly, front lawn and all, and the best part is this guy is like...  300lb, tries to be mobster/guido kinda guy, so hearing 'YA CHOWDAHEAD!!!' a bunch of times was fucking priceless

But then it turns out he actually was adopted.  His actual parents I assume had fucking tons of apologizing to do because they knew his adoptive parents, but Bullshit seems to be a much happier person, much more able to tell the truth, he's always been socially successful but I guess it's for the right reasons now

>The five cells are silky-white within, and are filled with a mass of firm, cream-coloured pulp, containing about three seeds each. This pulp is the edible part, and its consistence and flavour are indescribable. A rich custard highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it, but there are occasional wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine, and other incongruous dishes. Then there is a rich glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing else possesses, but which adds to its delicacy. It is neither acidic nor sweet nor juicy; yet it wants neither of these qualities, for it is in itself perfect. It produces no nausea or other bad effect, and the more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop.

fmz40jo,"Fine. If you genuinely don't believe that it matters, let me explain.

So generally, people who believe this theory see politics in two camps - the establishment, which includes candidates like Biden, Obama, and the Bushes, and the anti-establishment, which includes such candidates as Sanders and Trump. Logically, if there was a shadow council calling all the shots, you'd see a complete lack of AE candidates, as you would have a far easier time just keeping people that you don't like from running than you would from rigging the votes in this digital age. This is further proven in that Trump, an AE candidate won the election, and even if I see him as a moron that wants to set himself up as a monarch, the fact that he managed to win despite being an uncontrollable buffoon with loose lips sort of proves that there's no larger conspiracy going on.

Argh... I actually ignored my own advice...

OP, if you're trying to undermine faith in democracy or discourage voting, it's not going to work.",2020-04-10 13:28:59
fmz4ebt,Then why not make votes public and prove-able? Your dynamic makes sense if the only two options are establishment and anti-establishment.

It took me around 3 months to actually remove rice from my everyday staple. The first few weeks was hard as it made me feel really weak because of the low blood sugar level I guess. Now I don’t eat rice that much, just occasionally with some food.

Other kids didn't carry food too much, but they had a buck. Sooo, I would sell them for a buck a piece and we'd eat them in class to hold us over until lunch. I have also picked up broken rubber bands for money when I was really young and my dad had a side gig delivering newspapers. Broken rubber bands a-plenty. Oh, and killing bugs. I did that, too.

I’m so glad my landlord was there to help!). 

I guess you already went to search for it, hopefully it didn’t get hurt :)

I like kids & I know how to entertain them as I've been there (we all have), but I'm standing there doing ***ABSOLUTELY NOTHING***. No faces, no funny noises, nothing to make this girl laugh, especially this much. Confused, I shrug my shoulders, look at her dad, back to her, repeat several times, she'd have a gigglefit complete with matching red face throughout all of this, I would facepalm, he'd pay for his stuff & they leave. 

I worked there for 7 years & they came to my line every time I was on a register. When I wasn't & I was on the clock, her dad would make sure she got to laugh at me for a few minutes. Of course I never had a problem with this & actually, she once chased me around the store while it was crowded. I'm not kidding.

fmz3fhi,"After WWI, Germany was left in economic, and social, shambles. Hitler was both a soldier in WWI, so he already had a lot of respect(similair to how in the U.S., may presidents were in the army, and many royal families had some knighthood in their past). The Nazi party(Nazi is an abbreviation for the german words for National Socialism) were promising economic relief(and as a small point, they kind of did) to the country. He also proposed some of the worlds strictest gun control laws in the name of safety to fix social issues. Lastly, he saw that Jews didn't participate in WWI in Germany(I don't rember the reason why), and since most people already hated Jews, he was able to rally hate against them by blaming them for Germany's loss in WWI, which many people agreed with. The League of Nations already were restricting Germany's ability to grow an army, but Hitler managed to do it slowly so it wasn't noticable until too late. People saw all this, and voted because while he may have been addicted to Speed, he did genuinely care about Germany, and all the issues that the majority of people saw were being fixed.

TL,DR: Even though he looks bad from the outside, the people of Germany saw that he was fixing economic and social issues, and punished ""priviliged"" groups people already hated. Outside Germany and at the end of the war, he was evil, on the inside of Germany at the start, he was a hero.",2020-04-10 13:18:24

If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them. (Leviticus 20:13)

Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-10)

Next to that in Genesis, the Bible passage of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah described that the men of the village were forcefully and violently breaking into Lot's house to rape the two male messengers that came to warn Lot for the upcoming destruction of the cities, which was also due to their sexual immorality.

Let's say, there is a certain standard regarding sexual intercourse that God has set as the moral standard, which is morally 'good'. Whether you believe or accept it is your own choice, but God's standard is and will be the universal reality of what is morally good.",2020-04-10 12:51:11

Many cities that have been rebuilt, but to get past the shame of almost wiping out the entire world, they have all been renamed, new individual's names have been changed to reflect a brighter future, even most religions has changed. 

Then, a message is sent by aliens. The aliens plan to visit in about a year. All society starts to break down. You follow a family as they try to live in a world of people who are pro-contact, and those who fear the aliens and fear an invasion. Eventually riots break out, civil war erupts, the cities that have been rebuilt and all progress over the last century comes crashing down. hundreds of thousands are dead. Only a couple members of the family we are following make it to the aliens arrival. 

When the aliens land, their ship is massive, and so are the aliens who step out. Looking like giants, they are wearing suits with the words ""NASA"" written on the front with an American flag. This whole time, you have been following a humanoid culture on a different planet, and the aliens are humans. Since so much in the rebuilt society was changed name wise, it can lead the reader to not know we are not following humans.",2020-04-10 12:45:05

fmz5c5t,"My maths teacher when I moved down a set. She understood that I had dyslexia, even though most other teachers didn't. She'd print out papers specially for me in a font that made it a bit easier to deal with numbers, she taught me easier methods and told me it was ok if I didn't get it, and i would get there eventually.

Before exams she would wish me luck and tell me formulas I may need, she'd be willing to help me out at lunch or after school and would just appreciate everything I did right. If I got an answer right, she congratulated me in a way that made me feel like I wanted to do more, just to get that same feeling.

In a few months of being with her, I went from getting a 2 in maths to a 5, which is probably my biggest achievement. (Highest grade is 9, 4 is a pass.) She genuinely made me understand and changed my view on maths so much.",2020-04-10 13:53:17
fmz5vzt,My math teacher. He lets you basically cheat by looking through your notes on a test to find solutions but the test has different numbers so you still have to do the math but get to see how. He takes - 1 grade off of what you get though. Here grades are measured with numbers not letters with 5 being the highest so best you can get with checking notes is 4. Also if you don't skip class once the last test you get instant 5 without doing it. He if also the funniest teacher. Even if you fail and repeat its impossible to fail the second time even if 90% of your answers are wrong because he will strike a deal with you and let you pass with 3 which is lowest positive grade. If you don't fulfill your part of the deal he changes it back to the original grade though.,2020-04-10 14:03:35

Not sure if this really counts, but we started as friends, then FWB, and the whole time I’m trying very hard to not get my heart broken because of previous relationship shit. After months of the fwb thing, we have many talks and decide to start dating each other. Now, our whole friendship I had a front seat to him talk about every girl he noticed, was trying to date, girls he had liked since he was a kid, so there was the part of me that thought he just wanted to date me because it was easier than getting any or the other girls. One night we were on his couch cuddling, and he has his phone out and one of the girls he had a crush on since childhood sends him a Snapchat.  The insecure person I am, completely tenses up and tries to act fine because I know it’s weird to get so worked up about something like that, but I was getting overwhelmed with these jealous emotions I didn’t feel when we were just fwb. 

That night as were going to get in to bed, I tell him that maybe we should just go back to being just friends with benefits because I’m able to compartmentalize my feelings and ignore my jealousy. That poor guy started crying. I was trying so hard not to get my heart broken that I nearly broke his. 

I’m glad I was able to get over that built up jealousy that I wouldn’t have had if I hadn’t started out as this guys friend who got to hear about all of his amazing love interests, and I feel pretty bad about how insecure I can actually be. It’s kind of frightening.",2020-04-10 13:41:42

All of these things are promoted to a certain extent to keep the bottom 90% in fighting and distracted. Unfortunately the people largely running things benefit from it so we have to stop and collectively acknowledge what we’re really mad at and why. Frustration and misdirect over poverty cycles and inequity redefined as acrimony and confusion amongst differences. An example is people in the middle believing their taxes are inordinately redirected to social programs and entitlements of minority classes not working.

I guess I am not holding as many grudges as I thought because I don’t want to poop on their grave. I would fart in their general direction though. My petty grudges aren’t even interesting to me lol! But I’ll tell you about the Aunt I am named after who turned into my arch enemy.

Well, the family called me Small Jane (name slightly changed) I thought my first name was Small! They called my aunt Big Jane, which she resented. I think that is when it started. At first her slights and digs were small and she would cover them up by alternately being really nice. I found this confusing and ended up concluding it was my fault somehow. The event that made me hate her as mich as she clearly hated me was when I traveled to be with my grandma when she was dying. I was my grandma’s favorite, for much of my life my grandma lived with us and we shared the same room (we shared a double bed. We would talk every night until one of us fell asleep). Anyway, my Aunt blocked me from seeing my grandma for one full day. Not only that, but she told everyone, including my dying grandma that I wanted to shop at the mall instead of seeing her. The nest day I saw my grandma and we had the best time. Even though she was dying, we just acted like old times. The nurses allowed me to spend the night (gave me a blanket and reclining chair). My Aunt was bitter and nasty. I knew I wanted nothing to do with my Aunt after my grandma passed. That was 9 years ago and I still don’t speak to the aunt I was named after.",2020-04-10 12:58:33

My mom recently started making caramel corn the past few years for Christmas, along with the gallons of other food she makes. I thought she just found the recipe and was happy to find a good one as she would have a giant grin on her face when we confirmed she made a good batch (pretty much every batch). This past year though my sister was in the state visiting  for the first time since she moved and my mom asked us to take some over to my sister's best friend for her, but we had to make sure to set it on her doorstep and leave without getting caught (she knows who makes it though). Because I seemed to be the only clueless one here, my sister told me that her friend's mom (who had died around 8 years ago) was known for making it all the time and our mom happened to have the recipe she used and started to make some every year so that the friend would have a little bit of her mom around the holidays.

I grabbed a 12-pack of beer out of my car. We went down to his basement. There were only three other people there. Great. We decide to play some drinking games (it was his 21st, after all). The ONLY alcohol dude bought was Bacardi 151. No mixers.

Kindness from strangers, colleagues and friends made me realise that one person's unkindness was not worth the damage done to me. Therapy helped as I could vomit the pain, medication helped as it gave me space to deal with my emotions and once rationality returned, I made a conscious decision to be in service to others who are not as fortunate as I was to have people who cared.",2020-04-10 12:41:49

fmz3335,"Sneakers/shoes.

TL;DR: got in to shoes early 2019 and now it’s a huge part of my life as I get in to making customs and doing restorations.

So up until early last year, I would wear Vans slip-ons. Usually had one pair at a time, would wear it until it had holes in the sole, then go to the Vans outlet, buy another pair and wear it out of the store, tossing the old pair. Well, it was coming up on the time to refresh them and my brother makes the suggestion that I explore other brands, and have a few different shoes to rotate around so they don’t wear out so quickly.

Here we are, a little over a year later. 25 pairs of shoes, and dissembled shoes all over my home as I practice and learn how to customize and restore shoes. It’s the thing all of my friends and coworkers associate with me. Right now, I have a big focus on customizing and it’s been a major artistic outlet during the lockdown. Being able to have an idea and figuring out how execute it is deeply satisfying. I’ve got a big project in the works coming up and I’m more excited for it than I have been about anything in a long time.",2020-04-10 13:12:12

So in the 50s and 60s, lots of clothes were made with highly flammable materials. This, combined with low standards in fire safety and constant smoking, and there were numerous deaths from people just catching fire, including children.

In the late 70s, there was an aggressively-run PSA ad that coined the phrase, and it became part of our culture to know exactly what to do if your clothes ever caught fire.",2020-04-10 13:43:37

1.	Being able to pay for goods and services with an app on your phone. Was told that smartphones will never be ubiquitous enough for this to catch on.
2.	we had a contract with a restaurant and was given an opportunity to pitch some new products. I suggested a little tablet that sat at the table so guests could order and pay without waiting for the waitress. Was told that people would never want this because the wait experience was part of the fun of going to a restaurant.
3.	“What if Twitter was only pictures?” “People don’t take pictures that much.”
4.	Had the idea for Shopify back in 2006, but a lot of the stuff to make that work didn’t quite exist at the time, and not enough businesses were big on e-commerce yet.
5.	In 2002-3, I had this idea of gathering and parsing menus (using OCR scanning) from every restaurant in the area. Then there was a website where you could assemble and order, then it would send a fax to the restaurant with delivery information. This was basically DoorDash/Seamless/GrubHub. We actually built this, too, because we wanted to use it to make lunch easier. We bailed on this because it was too difficult to gather menus and manage the data.

But basically, I do get that r/politics can be annoying. Although, I do feel that if it was more mixed it would just be a ton of arguing on both sides...like, nonstop. Not sure.

fmz07ft,"Former film worker here:

When a male actor is doing a sex scene where he needs to be “nude” but no junk is shown, he will wear what we call a “sock” (has lots of funny names). 

The sock kinda envelopes the twig and berries at the base in a cloth tube. At the “head” end of the tube is a little strapy piece that allows you to pull the junk up between your legs Buffalo Bill style. It’s a simple process while everything is floppy down there, and the position it keeps your tackle in isn’t conducive to getting an erection. 

There are variations of this little device, but in most cases when you see an actor getting it on with an actress, and it’s not a porno, he’s wearing the ol’ cock sock.",2020-04-10 12:22:38
fmz034a,"I've done some googling because I've been curious about that too. I guess boners do happen and kind of are to be expected, but they don't happen often. Sex scenes are usually pretty uncomfortable because there's lots of people in the room during filming. I watched some interviews with actors from a show I watch that has lots of sex scenes. The two main characters said that during one of the scenes, there were 16 people in the room.",2020-04-10 12:20:33
fmz1wro,"Only once in film and a few times on stage.  

For film, you might have the captain say hello in the first few minutes (Odds are you've had barely any rehearse time and quite possibly you JUST met your partner moments ago, so everything is still ""new"" so Mr. Buddy is checking out the sights thinking ""FUCKIN RIGHT!"") - so in that moment, it's always, always easier to sheepishly address it before it happens. Here is where it's good to be able to read people. Take it seriously at first, you don't know what someone else's life experiences are, don't come outta the gate with sex jokes about your dick that they're about to feel pressed against them. Once they acknowledge the weirdness, it's always awesome to make fun of yourself and prop the partner up. Roll with the embarrassment and have fun - it will disappear after a few minutes once you start repeating the same damn take for the 34th time.   

On stage, fortunately, I've never need to have a boner ON stage. (I've only seen one stage production where that was part of the show and it was a bullshit art shock piece. Apologies if someone's into that. )  
  In rehearsals however: BONERS ALL THE TIME. You and your partner need to learn to be okay with that or at least be understanding or you won't get far. (In my experience it has led to the odd out-of-theatre-hook-ups, but that's something else.)  On stage though: never. Not once. It doesn't even cross your mind. It's surreal. On stage, you'll forget you need to piss or take a shit and your brain clicks back ""on"" once you exit the stage. ""Oh yeah, I have to piss!""",2020-04-10 12:51:36
fmz7ckj,"I was Rocky in Rocky Horror Picture Show for quite a while and while i didn’t wear anything specifically to keep me from getting an erection during the *many* sex scenes, the tight gold underwear and finale lingerie was pretty much too constricting to allow for it.",2020-04-10 14:31:23
fmz40rl,"I’m an actor and I’ve only had to do this once, but wore a speedo (sheets and shot angles helped). I know friends who’ve had to wear the old cock sock, as another guy on here mentioned, and it’s exactly as described. 

Also, thought I’d get turned on myself, and was nervous about it. But with so many people watching, that was never happening. Also the speedo (as I’d assume the sock would be) was very constricting.  

I’ve had to do other sexual things on screen and gotta say, it all depends on your partner. You wanna make sure they’re comfortable and every other actress has a different way of approaching it. Sometimes I’ve been with girls who want to rehearse so by the day you have chemistry. Then sometimes it’s day of. Especially if it’s tv and a guest star thing. 

It’s interesting because as a character you enjoy and want it, and as an actor it’s all business. And acting/business is ultimately what wins out, because that’s what’s real. I think. Not 100% what’s real anymore. Anyway, hope that helps?",2020-04-10 13:29:06

fmz209v,"Yes, compared to over 100 million PS4 players, and 50 million for each of Xbox One and the Switch today, plus god knows how many millions that exclusively play on PC. And that's only this generation. Lose the hostility.

Gaming was a much smaller hobby in the 90s since massively online games didn't exist at the scale they do today, which also meant their communities were far more isolated and fragmented. Increased PC ownership, significant improvements in the average PC's hardware capabilities, and the widespread adoption and usage of the internet in gaming over the last ~20 years have contributed to it becoming the far more recognized hobby it is today.

Nowadays you can find a Discord server numbering in the multiple thousands for pretty much any game you can think of. This level of infrastructure didn't exist 20+ years ago, hell even 10 years ago.",2020-04-10 12:53:17

Did things like discussion boards or online forums or Discord servers or Steam Community Workshop exist back then, with the level of infrastructure we have now?  How many games were available for the PS1 and how much time did people actually spend on them? Also remember that the vast majority of games were single player only.

Chances are, if you were a gamer in the 90s you played a few games by yourself a few hours a day at most, and the only people you spoke to about it were your handful of close friends, *if* you had any that shared your hobbies and played the same games as you. People were using dial up internet so the only time you'd actually even *talk* about gaming was when you saw your friends at school or on the phone, much less actually *playing together*. You'd have to get them to come over to your house if you wanted to do that; you couldn't just hop online and invite them to your lobby.

It's very common today for people to spend literally thousands of hours *on a single game*. That didn't happen 20 years ago, at least not as commonly. Gaming as an industry and as a hobby wasn't nearly as developed as it is now.",2020-04-10 13:05:42

fmz17pi,"I started working at a decorating business and one of the workers couldn't stand me. I'm assuming it was because I was a self-motivated hard worker as well as younger and more attractive than she was. There was a guy who worked there who all of us had a crush on especially Cruella. He was gorgeous, had long hair, was an artist, grew weed (this was in the late 70s in Humboldt County) and was our ""shutter"" man. We called him ""take a number Brown"" because women called him all the time.



The bitch kept telling me I was going to get fired because a recession was starting and business was down. She called me and told me she had quit and it was a good thing for me because I was going to be let go. Shortly thereafter I received a surprise call from my boss. He just wanted me to know I was never going to be fired but my arch nemesis was. I thought that was a real nice thing calling me like that. 



My revenge was accidental. The popular co-worker and I starting seeing each other. She went to my guy's art opening and saw that we were an item. I felt smug because I got the guy everyone wanted.

fmyzk4j,"I feel like I did last December, even if being 32 probably doesn't count as a midlife. 

After my grandmother died on Thanksgiving, I was helping my family sort through boxes and boxes of photographs, some from the late 1800's even. I would ask my mom and grandpa who certain people were if there was nothing written on the back. They of course could tell me, but only to a certain point.

It was then it dawned on me that at a certain point no one will remember who my grandmother is. Being one of three grandchildren, none of us have children of our own, and likely won't in the future sadly. Will I and my siblings be the last people to really remember my grandparents when they die, and my parents when they die, and then when my husband and I die, we will also fade away to no family passing down our stories and memories.

It made me start to feel hopeless and void, and don't see anyway we can change that. Even if my husband and I were to adopt like we want, those children would have no memories of my grandparents, and the line effectively ends with us. It makes me feel even more guilty I am as old as I am and am childless, something I have felt since I was 20.",2020-04-10 12:11:40

One day I realized no one believes my goals, no one really likes me. That day I made a promise to myself. so  I learned how to cook healthy, I started going to the gym, reading lots of books, Composing songs, etc. 

Nowadays I'm still not healthy, the damage was permanent. But at least I'm trying to be the best version of myself.  What I'm trying to tell is it's never too late. It's never impossible.

For example, something bad happens to a person you dislike. It's *very normal* to feel indifferent or even a little happy about it. We can be very dark creatures sometimes. That's *fine*. Cold, but understandable in certain situations.

However, what's *not at all fine* is straight up telling that person you are pleased at their misfortune when they are still dealing with the news, no matter how accurate or justified you think your sentiment may be. If you don't have anything nice to say at that point, it's usually best to just shut the fuck up.

It's another thing, though, to answer neutrally if you are asked about it in the future. I think it's a respectable stance to have if, after some time has passed after the news, someone asks you what you think about what happened to X person that you dislike and you respond with ""I'm not close enough to them to feel much sympathy/empathy"". Yea that's a little cold but I can respect that at least you're honest and not spiteful.

Of course this doesn't apply if the matter is of great personal loss, e.g. said disliked person finding out their relative has a serious diagnosis or has passed away. You're messed up if you feel happy about that, no matter how much of an asshole they are.",2020-04-10 12:38:09

fmyzobf,"Right, which for me at work, I’ve had people (especially supervisors) tell me a backwards way to do things and I’ve had this situation come up. In my line of work, there’s multiple ways to do something and the way I do it is still more efficient and faster, in my opinion, than doing it backwards the way they recommend. So instead of coming off like a big headed douche, I just told them I can try it that way and see how it compares to my original way and use which way seems most efficient. 

I usually just tell them this to get them off my back, because once the work is completed they don’t know which was something was started after it’s a final product, so it doesn’t matter. At the end of the day, they feel like their opinion mattered, was constructive, and was valid and I let them believe that, just so I’m not intentionally ruining their day.",2020-04-10 12:13:40
fmz029e,"That was the only example I could think of, honestly, and I agree it mainly pertains to women (which is why I asked for an elaboration.)

But without one is fine too, I used to have to be around friends to not come off as rude also so I get what you’re saying. It took me a little while to figure out the ropes that I could be flexible to communicate with different people differently. I’ve actually done workshops at work for this exact thing. Some people I still come off as to as difficult sometimes or abrasive, rude whatever, but it’s because I don’t know which way of communication works best for them and they don’t know which works best for me either. 

I think taking a few extra seconds to let your answer process in your head before saying it helps too. Not that you don’t think before you speak, but try taking a few extra seconds to think about what to say and how your words may be trigger words for a positive or negative connotation, then replace accordingly with maybe a longer, but less offensive language.

I guess yourself, since your followers have decided to claim that you, god and the holy ghost are the same being, so bad at being good? Or proving your existence? Or answering prayers  in any way that shows that you're behind it? If your dad flooded the earth, how did the kangaroos get all the way to Australia? Why should I bother believing all the stuff in the bible or even anything that you say yourself when, at least god knows everything that is to happen anyway? Which brings me to ask why you and your dad have intentionally allowed the literally incomprehensible amount of human suffering go on without ever stopping it save for a few anecdotal stories? Why exactly do you, your dad, whoever the holy ghost is supposed to be, and Satan and all your angels and Satans demons all follow the rules of toy story, where no ones allowed to know you exist in any individual, conscious level, at least until you decide to show yourself like this?

Do you know what those people have in common... They are native Citizens of the nation and the nation has a responsibility to them. Unlike the people they keep importing in order to maintain the slave class to keep wages and Prices of goods down.

You're right they aren't, but hey are a huge problem to the native working class of the nations that they are displacing.

>More of your money goes towards billionare payouts than to poor people.

You understand tax credits aren't the same thing as Food stamps and welfare right... Either way if you have more people using those system means you have less to give out to those in need. 

>Would be great if we stopped paying rich people to be rich

We don't, we pay them to provide jobs... Which helps our people.

fmyyen8,"As someone who was raised Catholic, I stopped believing in God because there was simply no evidence of them being out there. Not to mention, that as I got older, I saw how why religion was first developed. Humans cant really deal with their own insignificance, so they create God's to help them justify their own existence. Than after a few hundred years, this turns into  a way to control the people. Like the Pope of the Medieval Ages.   


If I was able to create my own God, I'd probably design one that showed themself to the world. So we could have proof of them. So we wouldnt have to rely simply on faith to know if they were real. Than, whatever commandments they came up with, I'd follow. Because you dont really argue with a God who's proven they are actually a God.",2020-04-10 11:52:29

fmyyd1u,"I don't believe in anything. I either know, gess, or don't know.

I think god probably does not exist, and honestly I don't care if they do. If they're the cruel slayer of people, I'm gonna live my life just the same because fuck them and go to hell smiling. If they're all good all forgiving, I'm going to heaven anyway so whatever. I have my own morality and need not a divine one.

I would generally prefer that a god does not exist, because I don't think any being should have that power. As Bakunin said ""If there was a god, we would need to abolish it"".",2020-04-10 11:51:45
fmyzj7v,"It was a slow process. In general though, some stuff in the bible didn't make sense, and the lack of proof. 


As for creating my own God, they would have to believe in equal rights for all, not all believers get into heaven, and not all non believers don't. I've seen so many ""religious"" people who don't even follow what is being preached. I would want the god to understand that the world isn't black and white but hundreds of shades of gray. There is just so much with religions I never understood why people believe that a gay couple is just as bad as a murderer and that they deserve the same fate.",2020-04-10 12:11:15

fmyypv4,"I dont believe in god(s) for many reasons.

There have been so many gods and religions who we now all call fake gods so why would the new ones be real?

Religion has always been a big reason for war or fights.

Religions dont teach you to respect everyone but to hate people who are different.

I grew up in a highly religous area and as a kid all the kids where told to get inside and to stay away from me and my family. The families talked soo much shit about us that even my friends became scared of us (another not religous family had the same happen to them. They lived a few streets away from us)

There are more reasons and i would never want to believe in a god because of those reasons",2020-04-10 11:57:38

I learnt more of all the suffering as well as the fact that I’m lgbt. The sheer amount of lgbt people killed in gods name really put me off religion. I also went to a really religious camp where women and minorities were not treated right and I was over it.

fmyzr4e,"Never really got into it, or felt like there was some being that could possibly know and see everything. Never really made any sense. (Helps my parents let me choose what I believe) If, however, modern religion was a lot closer to Norse mythology, I would have been much more willing to believe it. Far less cryptic, not all knowing/seeing, very reasonable/personable, etc. idk, I think I found religion (christianity) to convenient and unrealistic. I could potentially get behind Buddhism, but, by now I feel religion just isn’t my thing. However, I don’t try to convince people they are wrong for believing. Don’t try to force it on me and we’re cool.",2020-04-10 12:15:00
fmz0yj1,Idk I just kinda grow out of it in a way like Santa or the tooth fairy I was just like “Mum and Dad Santa isn’t real I don’t believe in him anymore as well as God”,2020-04-10 12:35:22
fmz1vep,"I was raised as a churchgoer but gave up on it as a teenager; I wasn't just an atheist then, but I was the kind of atheist who is an obnoxious jerk about it, until partway through my twenties (it didn't help that I found out the church had done a truly horrible thing to my mother before I was born).

But in my twenties, I kind of stopped and thought, if the universe really is pointless and meaningless, then it's just too bleak to be part of. I asked my Dad once if he believed life had meaning, and he answered that he believes it's our job to give life meaning.

That kind of collided with my spiritual crisis and I decided that I could indeed choose to believe in a god, even though there would never ever be any way to prove whether He/She/It/Them/Whatever is, because by following that path, I could make bits of the universe better.

I don't regard any specific deity archetype as definitive; in fact I subscribe more to what I have heard referred to as Ig-theism (the idea that not only do humans not understand the nature of God, if there is one, but that we are in fact fundamentally incapable of understanding it).

But the archetype that fits best for me is that of the Fates, partly because if there is a deity, it's clearly part of their agenda to never provide us proof of their actions here on this planet. Therefore they must be acting through things such as random events that can never be proven.

(I do believe in free will though, and don't consider this a dichotomy: I believe that if there is Fate, it may work in such a way that you may be fated to face a decision; but that it is your free will how you will make that decision when it arrives.)

fmz7925,"I don't believe in him because of science honestly, think about it, humans all supposedly came from Adam and eve which means that we would all have similar dna and therefore looks in a way, but nope also the fact that if god were ever to exist, he would have done something to help people in disasters or prevent them all together, but nope, and there's the whole fact that there is this mystical being out there, that nobody has ever seen and has no proof of. There is also the fact that there was the whole Noah's arch thing how he got 2 of every animal on his ship. There is no chance in hell every animal x2 was able to fit on that. And I believe he was the only person on the ship as well so wouldn't everyone else have died? He would have been the last person on the earth but here we all are today.",2020-04-10 14:29:31

It’s easy in that you can do whatever you feel like doing for the most part, especially if you don’t live with your parents. Your roommates certainly aren’t going to tell you to go to bed if they see you eating a box of pop tarts in front of the TV at 2 AM. But that very same concept means you are responsible for taking care of yourself which is arguably the hardest part of being an adult. It’s now up to you to do everything that was previously done for you. You got bills due? You have to pay them. You need to see a doctor? You have to be the one to call. Tax season is coming up? Better get your shit together. X, Y or Z comes up? You’re the one that needs to handle that. In conclusion, adulthood is both a blessing and a curse.

The Recruiters Job is to get you into the Military. So they will often make sure you are ultra prepared and do everything in their power to make sure you are good to go. Now, for my Recruiters, this is because they want me to succeed. Because hell, another Marines just means another brother for them. But for some it may be like a commission of sorts if they have those in other branches.  


Before I went to MEP's I was sat down in front of the Head Recruiter, a big bald irish dude, and asked questions.   
Sergeant: ""Do you want to be in the Marines?""  
Me: ""Yes.""  
SGT: ""Alright, have you ever smoked weed?""  
M: ""No.""  
SGT: ""Are you sure? Because if you tell them something else, we cant help you.""  
M: ""...Yes, I've smoked weed.""  
SGT: ""Good. Now have you smoked weed?""  
M: ""No."" More Confidently  


They will prepare you for MEPs \[at least if they're like mine\]. They had us take a Drug Test before we even went there. They said if it came up positive, they'd cancel our MEPs date and delay us.

What makes it worse is that I can FEEL things. The other night, one of the creatures guned twords me and grabbed my neck. I felt it's cold hand wrap around it before I woke up. This isn't the first time something has gone for my neck and it's terrifying. Yet, I love my dreams so much. There are nice things but there are a lot where something is after me.

fmyzypx,"Beware: this story is a bit dark.

At my primary school, we had a head mistress that felt very much like the one in the film Matilda (except she was quietly psycho, not obviously psycho). Anyway, one of our secondary principals (we had 4 all up, including head mistress) left the school, and was replaced by a very timid, balding guy (we'll call Jim). So Jim was a sweetie, and despite/because of this he kind of got walked all over by the students. Turns out he was getting it from the other principals too.

To make a long story shorter, after about only a month of him being at the school, we stopped seeing him. One assembly about a week after not seeing him, head mistress tells us he passed away (which was true, but they hid the details). 

About another week following this, head mistress and the other principals were ALL fired from the school and replaced (we were told it was because they illegally increased the school's test average or something). (Which I think also did happen).

Didn't think too much of it until I got to high school, decided to Google it and find out what happened. Turns out the principals were bullying Jim, mainly head mistress. He ended up killing himself by gassing himself in his car. Really sad stuff.",2020-04-10 12:18:30
