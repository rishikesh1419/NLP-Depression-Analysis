I've been dealing with depression for what feels like all my life. I had another attempt at improving my life, joined a gym doing classes I enjoyed, took pressure off myself for not being on top of the housework and my husband kept telling me how amazing I was doing, being positive and changing my life around. Secretly, even though I have an amazing husband, an easy job I enjoy working only 12 hours a week, was only doing three workouts a week that I enjoyed and my life was cruisey by most peoples standards, I felt I was barely treading water. I then came down with shingles and I'm back in the dark. I feel pathetic, trying to turn my life around was exhausting. I just want to sleep on the couch. I want to want to get better but it feels impossible. I'm on medication, I've done the psychologists, I try happify, I do the exercise programs/meditation/mindfulness, it does nothing. I was walking every day last year with my beautiful dog, who lifted me every day, then she got sick, after two weeks and $6000 of vet bills, we decided the best thing for her was to let her go. I'm still heartbroken. I don't believe in god or fate but when I'm like this it feels like everything is conspiring to keep me down, I don't deserve to be happy. I think my brain is broken, it doesn't work like it should. I'm so tired

I haven't posted for a while now. I can't find my thread any more its been so long. 
I'm back posting about my body image issues again. I've struggled since the age of 14 with my weight.This is when my depression first started also. I've both underweight  and overweight ,currently over. I am very low in energy and my depression is bad. 
I don't have the energy to write up a long history again as I have done before.I have done therapy 12 years with the same psychiatrist and many self help groups and methods for about 15 years . I'm not open to more therapy at this point. 
 I would just like to know other feel this way.
I'm embarrassed that these thoughts still rule me. To the point of despair. I feel ashamed. I want to hide away.
I feel hopeless and defeated.

Hi, I wasn't exactly sure where to post this, but I hope this is the right section.
I have been struggling quite badly with Depression and Anxiety for a while now due to being unemployed for a long time, and constantly feel like a failure and embarrassment. I also lost my Dad to Cancer this year, and have been trying to deal with it, but feel so much guilt and regret. Stress has been affecting my sleep, and I'm just in a pretty dark place at the moment. 
I have been trying to find a light at the end of the tunnel, and trying to get further in life, but life is very bleak at the moment.I would love some advice on how others deal with Depression and Anxiety, or what people do to feel better. I have recently tried Yoga, and that had been helpful for a while, but that stress always returns. 
 Thank-you for taking time to read this, And I'm sorry if it's hard to make sense of. <3

Like many with mood disorders, managing these moods can seriously take over our entire lives. 
As a bipolar ii sufferer, undertaking medication and therapy (limited), there's still little things that we can do in trying to curb these moods. 
Letting our emotions get the better of us, lends a hand to strong mood changes. Emotions require managing for everyone, regardless of who you are, but us bipolar folk need to be even more careful.
I have read a lot about the HALT principle. 
This involves identifying when our emotions are changing and acting on this. 
Are we? 
H - hungry 
A - angry 
L - lonely 
T - tired
Once you've looked at these, then work hard to try and remedy this, before the emotions take off and are moods start sliding (up of down or even sideways) 
Seems small, but it's a practical step we can implement when reviewing how we feel 
Peace x

I have no clue how this happened but I haven't left the house since 10/6.  I'm so down and fatigued constantly.  I start sweating, shaking and have shallow breathing just thinking about go out.   My psychologist says just push through it.  You won't die.  But how do I explain that just having a shower is a battle of the mind.

I was diagnosed nearly 2 years ago with anxiety and depression. I'm doing the whole medication and engaging with a psychologist and psychiatrist on a monthly basis. I am almost at my wits end with it all. I don't feel that I am progressing at all!!
I am still very unhappy in my life and I work in a job that I barely like. I'm not doing anything positive to help myself, I don't eat properly, I don't exercise or get out at all. I want to get out of this rut but don't seem to have the get-up and go to get it happening. I wonder if my life will be any different to the extent that I can say that I am in remission.

Hello online community. This is my 1st post so yay for me, I suppose this is a good step. 
 Where do I begin? I have suffered from depression and anxiety since my teens and it has been an up and down battle ever since. 
 I have been in a loving relationship for over 6 years now. My partner is what dreams are made of, supportive, understanding, loving and will do anything for me.
 Lately though I am so depressed and anxious, I can't even get off the couch. I don't sleep, I don't eat and I have zero motivation. Yesterday I couldn't go to work, which makes me more anxious as I had to call in sick (gotta love the power of anxiety hey?) 
 I try to zero in on my thoughts to try and work through them, but they are going so fast I don't even know what they are.  I feel so guilty as I have completely removed myself from my partner and I can see that im hurting him. How can he love the half version of myself? 
I feel so lost and unfulfilled, like I've wasted my prime time. I guess I feel like I don't even know myself anymore.  
 Anyway, I don't even know where I'm going with this, I guess I just need to hear that im not alone, not crazy and there are others out there that feel the same. 
Thank you and stay strong!

Hi everyone. I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease about when I was 32 years of age. Since it became an issue, I have not been able to hold down a job for longer than 6 months. I have constant bouts of depression, for which my husband's answer is ""suck it up"". He is a control freak, has kicked me out of the house, and is having an emotional relationship with a once close female family friend and says it's all in my head. I am about to lose it completely. I just don't know what to do.......

Hi All, this is following on from my last post a couple weeks ago with where I am at and how things are.
I haven't been able to see a GP yet and haven't been overly keen to due to the fact that I would probably lose my Gov. job and have a cascade of other events occur, however I have more-so just been monitoring how I have been going and will make the decision to see someone if there is no improvement.
Long story short from my other thread, I've had issues at work the last 12 months with definitely some workplace bullying (Management told me to basically suck it up and be resilient) . This has had me extremely depressed whenever I would travel away for work for the few days I would be there (I work away from home so I spend 3-4 days a week away from home).
Last week the culprit with this workplace bullying tried to put me in the spotlight for something I did not do, and just interacting with him and rightly justifying myself left me extremely anxious and I could feel my heart beating through my chest.  
I literally cannot enjoy my last day off any more because I know I will have to travel to work, and it's gotten to the point where I don't want to do anything really on that last day off because I just feel really down and sad about travelling back. 
Someone might be able to weigh in here on this - currently I can only be happy when being around home and with my girlfriend. At work I feel like I have this heavy weight on me where I am just constantly feeling upset and just anxious about things that I shouldn't get anxious or worried about (for example, worried about my girlfriend when she has proven to me she is extremely loyal and would never do me wrong).
My biggest problem is that I just go into my shell when I am at work and it feels like that roller coaster of emotions like I explained. I have gone from an out-going care-free kind of person to someone now who is constantly down about being away from work & my partner, and just feeling like I can't really be properly happy and enjoy the things I would usually do even when I am away from that environment.
Does anyone else experience these acute fluctuations in feelings? I can be walking around and just feel dizzy, and generally unwell at work. Even travelling to work at the end of my last day off can easily get me quite upset and again nearly making me feel sick .I've always tried to push through this, my work performance is suffering as a result and I feel my relationship may suffer as well.

So I saw my psychologist this morning and he pointed out I have tunnel vision. For example I'm convinced I need to go to a health retreat, lose 30kg get married and have kids. I'm convinced I need a uni degree so I earn enough so I can get married and have kids. Uhhhh how do you fix that? 
My psychiatrist told me there's more to life than Marriage and kids and it's totally blown my mind.
help please....

I'm sick of being alone, acting like I'm fine and pretending like everything is okay and looking after everyone while no one pays any attention to me. I'm sick of being the one who people use to vent to and then discard once they're finished being sad, of being treated like an object. I'm sick of never having anyone ask me something that I can actually expand on because I know that they do not care about me. They have too much on their plates to be worried about what I have going on in my life; too much of their own problems for me to add onto it. I'm sick of never being able to talk, and never being happy. I'm sick of never enjoying a moment of my life for more than 10 minutes without a wave of depression being dumped on me by either myself or one of the many people I have to look after and support. I am sick of the fact that no matter how good life seems to be getting, I can't turn the corner and not have some tragedy come and hit me in the face. I never get to be me, I never get to experience things the way I want to. I'm sick of the fact that any time I want to talk or vent or express any form of sadness, someone else has something happen in their life and that becomes the focal point for them and me, meaning that my problems are pushed aside and forgotten. I hate that I can't do anything for myself without thinking about someone else the entire time. The fact that no matter what I plan for myself, I know that it will never happen without the entire activity being overshadowed by my feelings and thoughts being focused on someone else destroys me, it makes me realise that I am not living my own life, I am just an extra in everyone else’s. It doesn't help that half of the messages I send to people are ignored for hours on end, even when the person I messaged has come online at least 3 or 4 times since I sent the message and they still haven't bothered to even look at it let alone respond. I just wish someone would put in the effort to talk to me and to see me. I just want someone to care about me and how I am. But this will never happen, and I know that I will never be okay with that. Both of my best friends have significant others whom they can talk to and rely on. I have no one and I never will. I am so lonely and sad all of the time that I can't spend a day with the two most important people in my life without ruining it by becoming sad. I can't remember the last full day I had where I was happy. I am so lost and don't know where to go.

Hi Everyone.
 I'm a 28 year old Male, who is struggling with my Anger and Depression more now than anything. 
 I have been laid off work, and am finding it extremely hard to get another job. I have a Fiancé and 2 year old daughter, and we are financially struggling. Very much so, that we have to sell Household items to live, which is becoming hard because we really have nothing left to sell. 
 I feel like a Failure, that I can't support my Family, and that each day comes, I don't know whether we will eat. 
 We both have no family who talk to us, and it limits us to help. 
 My anger of late, is really taking a toll on our Relationship. I'm always so Angry. The smallest thing sets me off. I instantly regret when I go off, but I can't help but go off. My Fiancé and Daughter are my world. We are all we have. But I feel as though I'm going to lose them soon, if I don't stop my Anger. 
Ive tried getting help, but it never seems to help me. Can anyone relate, or have any advice for me. I am struggling. I don't want to be Angry and Depressed no more. 
 Suicide has never and will never be an option. I just want to be happy and normal again. 
Thanks

Hi,
I'm new to the forums. I'm 31, and i have bipolar, panic disorder, ptsd, and bdp. 
I'm currently studying at uni, however, I feel like I have no direction in life, no life goals. 
I have changed degrees so many times, because i am just not happy with what i'm doing. I constantly feel like i'm stuck on step one and can never move forward. 
I've had a lot of issues in my life, particularity being in a domestic violence relationship for 8 years where i wasnt allowed to do anything. Now that i am out of that situation, and with a loving partner, i have no real idea of what i want to do with my life. 
I do not handle any kind of stress well, however, i'm trying to preserver with uni because i do want to learn and feel educated, and i do want a career. But every time i think i have chosen my set career, i end up feeling quickly bored by it, or too overwhelmingly stressed by it. I even changed unis to see if that was my problem, but no, here i am again, completely unsure as to who i am and what i should do.
The other thing is, i have never had a job before. I was in that horrible relationship from a young age, and for the past five years i have been just trying to get back on my feet again without crumbling into a heap every two seconds. I just feel like I have no identity. I dont know who i am, and nothing i have found so far seems to fit me.
How can i move past this?

Is it normal to constantly want to""hurt"" yourself during a particularly bad period of depression? I don't mean physically. Any way of sabotaging my future seems to be on the cards. This time it cost me a redundancy payout (20 years). Another time it was a split of my divorce settlement (I gave everything instead to my ex). Usually it is smaller, not financial, more a way of putting myself last somehow, others always first.
It's obviously some kind of martyr complex. Often others don't know about it, else I'd guess it was to make others feel sorry for me. I think perhaps it's because I have somehow come to like being hopeless? 
Does anyone else have this? It has been extremely destructive to my life.

 the combination of the two has triggered my depression and I just don't know what to do. I see a pysch and am on anti depressant. My pysch wanted to up my dosage but I don't want to do that. I hate the fact that I have to take them in the first. I'm completely lost and don't know what to do with myself. I can't switch my brain off and im constantly in tears. I go back to work tomorrow and physically making myself feel sick. I want to call in sick but I can't after having two days. I'm just a mess

Black Dog

Life was so great, it was joyful and fun
Time spent basking, in the glimmering sun
A loving family and good friends a many
I had no worries, didn’t want for a penny

But life has now changed, it’s a misty grey fog
I’ve been told I’ve got, the dreaded ‘Black Dog’
What does that mean, I question of myself
My vitals are fine, in good physical health

This blasted Black Dog, which I cannot see
I hope it’s small fleas, keep clear of me
No whining, no barking, what’s this all about
I don’t see droppings or feel its wet snout

This Black Dog surrounds me, every waking day
I don’t feed the damned thing, yet it won’t run away
“Leave!” I command, of this vile shady dog
But it lingers over me, as I’m left in a fog

The Black Dog is made up, I hear them all say
Stop all this nonsense and get on with your day
They don’t understand, they don’t even try
While I’m feeling hollow, I slobber and cry

I don’t get it either, I'm stuck in this trap
This Black Dog that haunts me, but don’t even crop
I sob hopelessly, while my body does quiver
I’ve blubbered so much, I’ve cried me a river

I scream, “leave me Black Dog, I don’t want to play,
Leave now Black Dog and keep right away!”
So, how long will it stay, I really don’t know
But I’d feel much lighter, if the damned thing would go

Why is it after a number of therapy sessions, trying different therpeutic approaches, research and self analysis, unsuccessful medications, discussions with family and close friends that I feel so misunderstood? I don't blame anyone for this because if I struggle to know self how can anyone else. There doesn't seem to be an answer and I'm slowly losing my grip on the basic realities of life. And that scares me a bit as I feel there is an inevitable conclusion to all this. Does anyone really understand the frigging hopelessness that is depression, the ever present melancholy that won't let go despite concerted effort to shrug it off. There has been recent sportsmen who have ""stepped away from the game to deal with mental health issues"" and the world goes awww, poor things, only for these guys to appear next week and get on with it. If only it was that easy as its not the depression I know. I've tried everything in order to get a grip on this black dog but nothing seems to work. I'm not after sympathy at all, it's my lot and I'm responsible and I get that. I guess I'm just looking for someone to acknowlege what a bummer this involuntary condition is. I know I'm not the only sufferer, but in my world no-one gets me or it. Thanks for listening.

For the longest time my young heart and mind were steeped in despair. At an age where other children were beginning to learn about human nature I had already tainted myself with the numbing belief that the world had very little to offer. Living appeared to me a futile struggle of the narcissistic compulsions of the individual and the forces of social oppression that smothered any humanity. As childhood morphed into adolescence this misguided and naive conviction was only compounded by the ruthlessness of teenage years. Imagine then my young-self being thrusted into the modern workforce - the sad struggle for the illusionary security that money offered and the disconnection of one's consciouness in the workplace was horrifying. I felt alone, withdrawn, isolated - suffocating from an imagined weight so oppressive it mocked anything reality itself could conjure. I genuinely believed myself to be unlovable - my experiences had rendered me almost catatonic - I felt so physically and internally ugly that no one could possibly ever love someone so broken. 

Slowly, but surely, people and humanity proved me wrong. Bit by bit it began to dawn on me that not only did beauty exist in this world - it existed in an almost infinite abundance. I discovered real friendships, I luxuriated in the intimacy of being in love and I finally learnt to appreciate the true power of resilience and generosity that was my mother and father's love.

Now, almost everything I see, almost everyone I meet, almost every human interaction I witness is seeped with unimaginable beauty. The empathy and instinctive understanding of the human soul and mind that had caused me so much pain before has now enabled me to experience a crescendo of joy in simply existing. 

A friend once said to me that ""while you're very perceptive of people's flaws you somehow naturally define them by their strengths"". I've pondered why and I believe this reflection answers it. In my mind no one is more critically flawed than myself - so my empathy has allowed me to forgive myself and all others. It's probably the most powerful tool of survival that I have ever possessed. 

For all those in despair and feel that light is simply a figment of one's utter desperation I say again - there is immense beauty in our existence.

Hi.
12 months ago I was diagnosed with Postnatal Anxiety. Started out as sleep deprivation. Was probably averaging 2-3 hours a night. Didn't matter if baby was asleep, I couldn't sleep. Anyway, this all came up at 6 week postnatal checkup. From here I was poorly managed. I told the GP I wasn't coping and the GP wanted me to wait a week to speak to a MH nurse. Ended up back at the GP the next day begging for help. They were insistent on me trying particular class of antidepressant (which I had previous manic episodes on) and benzodiazepines so I could continue to breastfeed. No matter how hard I insisted I would stop breastfeeding regardless of the medication given, the GP would not prescribe the medication I usually take for previous MH issues.
Well no surprises what happened next..... I had a manic episode. Psychotic I would call it. I was paranoid, I had auditory hallucinations, I kept thinking my baby was sick. I feel like I had taken a handful of amphetamines along with some hallucinogenics. I ceased the anti depressant after 5 days and continued to take the benzo - taking large amounts just to feel like I had my feet on the ground. 
After a wash out period the doc allowed me to take the antidepressant which I had first requested. They also allowed me to change to a longer acting benzo while the new meds settled. Well this proved problematic. I developed some dental and neck issues and was placed on opioid medications. Well you can probably guess how that turned out.
Fast forward 12 months and I have just self detoxed off 9 months of opioid abuse. I was left in the dark by my GP and also forced to go into withdrawal of benzodiazepines cold turkey. A week later I consulted a drug and alcohol doctor who put me straight back on the benzos and we are now doind a very slow taper. 
I have never felt so depressed in all of my life. My mood ranges from low to nothing. I see my psychologist once a week and also the D&A doc. I no longer have the support of a psychiatrist as they were seen via telehealth at the GP office where I am no longer a patient. Where I live a bulk billed psychiatrist is a fair way away. 
I am now pretty certain that my depression is no longer from the postnatal issues, but from the prescription medications. 
How do you motivate the unmotivated? Someone who knows what they should be doing to get better but can't get up and do it. Someone tell me it gets better?!

I just really need to talk.
My depression has gotten really bad in the last week. I went off my medication at the beginning of the year and things were okay for a while. Every now and then I would get a mild depression but nothing too bad.
Last Saturday it hit me pretty hard. I've completely lost my appetite and broken into tears more than once. I struggle to get up. I spend most of my time in bed or on the floor. The negative thoughts are overwhelming, but I can't stop thinking them.
I went back on my medication 2 days ago. Obviously no change yet.
It's the feelings of uselessness that really get me

Today is my Birthday, and again it is a day that only makes me AWARE of how little I mean to people.
Yet another so called ""Special"" day where no matter how much I show my love and devotion to other's, and they all know that I have been struggling with Anxiety and depression, nobody even thinks of trying to give me an uplifting day. No morning""Happy Birthday"" from my 13 year old daughter or my husband. I guess they forgot again. I regular thing I guess, and people wonder why you are struggling inside. 
My mother hasn't wished me a Happy Birthday for year's, she usually rings me the next day when she realises she forgot, and tells me that she was feeling tired. It's actually a good thing, because all she talks about is my little brother. I have been forced to deal with issue's with them both for years.
Anyway, just sad to be made AWARE yet again

I don't know if this has been posted elsewhere. Or if we are allowed to post links etc. If not I'm sure the moderators will sort it out.
Just read an interesting article in the Age, the content certainly applies to me and I am sure many others.
It applies in particular to people (like me) who apparently have a good life, great family, friends, work, no worries mate. But we are depressed or sad, and then feel guilty and bad about being depressed which makes us even more depressed. Maybe read the article, it is explained much better there. I'm not sure if we can post links but here it goes:

I tried writing this post yesterday but
lost it when I pressed post this thread it disappeared. I saw my
psychologist yesterday. After a discussion of several different
issues I mentioned having felt down for no apparent reason. He said
there is always a trigger so then started a discussion to discover
the trigger. The fairly calm normal consultation turned very
emotional with me feeling embarrassed, stupid guilty & really
upset. The psych was good trying to listen, encourage & support
me as I tried to sort out my thoughts. 

The issue is that I try to fit in with
others even when it is not in my interests & wait for my husband
to offer to do things I want rather than even asking him. This leads
to me feeling stupid because I'm setting myself up to be disappointed
& get angry with my husband for not fitting in with my wishes
even though I haven't told him what I want. I know I'm being stupid
doing this but don't seem to have the motivation to change. I need to
be clear about what I want & be willing to be assertive in asking
for my wishes to be met. 

The only reason I can think for this
issue is that I feel I don't deserve anything. I feel that noone
really likes me so I don't want to put pressure on others to fit in
with me. This is probably based on experiences as a child when I was
bullied badly leaving me with long standing self esteem issues.
Having had good parents just makes me feel like I have no excuse for
managing better as I don't have the excuse of a dysfunctional family.

Does anyone else have these issues &
how do you cope

Yesterday was one of those days. No matter what my wife said to me or did it was going to trigger me.
I had decided early in the morning i could not be reached. ""Why is she with me? I am not goodenough for her! She deserves so much better!
It went downhill from there. I took something to heart. A personal attack! She hates me,  she doesn't know what I am going through. She always attacks me.
The thoughts run at a million miles an hour. I am in no state to discuss an issue calmly or pull myself out of my hole. She pushes me to talk. I know deep down if we discuss this calmly it will be resolved in 5 minutes.  Instead i snap back.  Biting with words I know will hurt, will get a reaction and then my thoughts becomereality. ""See, she doesn't love you. You are weak, you are a coward, you wil never be good enough"".
I sit in the car to go and she follows. I switch to calm to gain the higher ground. Now if i am calm and she is not i am the one who is hard done by. I am the one who is trying to resolve this.  It is not true. I say something bitey. That will make her feel bad surely. 
I leave and go to a place that will pull me up. I read, i find new books that will help me inthe long run. I send a text.  I will be home soon, she replies, so will i. I go home and wait upstairs.  Head in hand, the dark thoughts filtering around. Time to separate.  Where will  I live. The wedding was such a waste of money. Have i ever made her happy. I hid the black dog from her but it is now so big it takes hold
I cant face her, i am such a weak and defeated useless being. I can never get a hold of this thing.  How do i leave her?  I know it will be easier for her there is no question.  An hour passes and she comes upstairs.
""This isn't helping either of us. We need to talk about this""
""I can't face you i say. I am too weak ""
""Well then you need to find strength ""
""I can't,  we're through,  we're done, i just know it""!
The next hour involves my tears, my defeat. I push her away and won't accept she wants to help. I keep telling myself she doesn't love me despite what she says. She doesn't care, how could she. 
""Mediate"" she says "" that always helps""
""Nothing will help""
"" i am not leaving you until i see a meditation started"" After backand forth i eventually listen. It relaxes me. I feel some calm.
Why could i not have done this 3 hours ago?  Why can't I accept the support on offer.  Why can i not listen to the one who loves me and knows me better than i know myself?

I've been struggling with with anxiety dyslexia insomnia and depression my whole life (25 y.o) but have always prided myself on being able to get through anything thrown my way so I've never really been incorporated into the system, and I have been able to cope well until recently. After studying tertiary science for 6 years my recent job history is non-existent, I thought I was doing the right thing by just focusing on my studies but it seems I've dug myself into quite a hole by not having recent experience. Having moved 2 hours out of the city to the old family town I'm struggling. I decided to get some help from my new GP the medications have some srs side effects, still here after months. I have to decide between being able to sleep or being able to drive, hard decision when looking for work in a rural area. Being on welfare means I'm on a knifes edge when it comes to competing my search requirements constantly battling the side effects. I know this isn't sustainable so I'm going through the steps of getting help, but it's taking so long. I've driven 500km to no avail this week alone back and forth to the nearest town getting thrown around between my jobserch provider, centrelink and my GP. I've been waiting for 2 months for a CBT appointment and I feel it just wont provide the level of help I need and after all the driving I'm still no closer to getting help, all the while I'm still having to meet requirements. They say until I get recognised though official lines there's nothing they can do and have to meet all the requirements a healthy person would. The problem is it's taking so damn long and I'm concerned they won't recognise my issues and write me off as another dole bludger, as on paper they are all 'new' problems where in reality I've just never gotten help and always been able to manage well on my own. I don't wan't a disability pension or to take a break I just want someone sympathetic to my challenges who can help me through them, at the moment that's not happening and they're just making it worse and the time and miles I'm racking up trying to sort this out is making it worse and getting me nowhere. I don't want to go back to that place they have no idea how to help me they just make it worse, thinking about makes me want to throw up. Can't even count how many hours I've been on hold in government call centres trying to change my situation all the while shaking, struggling to keep food down battling a medicated haze and all for nothing.

What is it when you dont believe what people say? All my life ive been some would say negative person, but at times i think im being realistic. I think im not smart, that none wants me or my friends wouldnt care or miss me. But my friends tell me how awesome they think i am. They tell me i am smart and they miss me. Ive tried to listen but i have come to reality, theyre my friends they have to say those things. My brain just doesnt believe any of it. I cannot see the truth in it and im sick of trying to make out i believe it just because someone has said something sweet or kind about me. The reality is...i dont believe what they say is true and i wish theyd listen to me and agree with me. To be honest if i was smart, in wouldnt be thinking things like this.

Loving Chi (c)

I look in the mirror, what do I see?
A very strange image staring back at me.
Where is the kindness, I like to share?
Shrouded in blackness, as I stand there.

The mirror is hazy, blurry and stark,
Why does my image look so dark?
I try again, I focus ahead,
My eyes stare back, ever so dead.

I rub my eyes and try once more,
I see my dark side, ever so raw.
My hand lifts up, in a straight line,
What stares back, has a hateful sign.

My image is rigid, stoic and black,
It’s shamed, it’s ugly, but starts to crack.
I stare once more, with kinder eyes,
This time I look close, past all the lies.

I glimpse the kind soul, lying within,
I start to smile and lift up my chin.
I leave with this image, held tight to me,
And start my day, with a loving chi.

I've been suffering what my psychiatrist calls a severe depressive episode for over a year. In that year I have lost my dad, mother in law, and best friend to cancer. I've been in a mental health ward in that time for three days and barely at work.
First saw the psychiatrist a month or so ago and after a few tries it seemed that we got my meds right - the medication really helped and improved my motivation.
yesterday I accidentally took my night meds in the morning. I slept most of the day. At the end of the day got some bad news about my mums pension resulting from her selling her house. The feeling of dread and hopelessness returned. Had a horrible night's sleep, dreamt I was at my friends dad's funeral.
Teary and overwhelmed.

Forgive me if I'm not grateful for my life in advance.  I am grateful for all that I have but it's the ME bit I've never settled with.  I go through the motions, go through the necessary things in life and feel settled that I can achieve them.  I can look after a house, children and a husband.  Over the years I've found new ways of coping with stress and my first thought each day is centered around finding the most effective ways to combat stress, or at least what my brain perceives as possible stress.  I'm well aware that others might not find some things that I do as a stressor but I've learnt that I can't afford to focus on their ways because I'm not them.
All I can do is focus on myself, the children and my husband.  I've dabbled here and there increasing my duties outside of home etc and for the most part coped ok.  
The nagging thought I have though in life right now is, is that what my existence is? I mean, is it just survival or will I get further nourishment to top me up? It's like my brain is not getting the feel good endorphin mix, I take a sauna and swim but don't get long term nourishment, I ride my bike but only feel temporary pleasure, I make my jewellery but the creative side fills me only for a second.  My brain seems to feel devoid, depleated of a long term satisfaction.  I worry that despite me doing things with my children, asking them about their day and generally being there for them that they feel my dissatisfaction some how.  My thick skinned sort of strength though keeps me forcing myself to accept things and keep moving forward or along.  I use keeping out of hospital as a yard stick for my own success in dealing with mental illness but sometimes wonder if this is acceptable line of thinking.  Again, its all survival based living. 
Again, I sound like I'm complaining, I should not.  It's just a genuine question because I'm doing all the things I can to live a life of harmony but my ability to really feel things is lacking right now.
Most people accomodate a broken leg, arm or the like.  With mental illness, it's just not possible to get an undertstanding going.  
How do people out there with mental illness get your struggle across, get an understanding going without upsetting people of what you can cope with? 
I actually just feel really lonely right now.  We have to exist with people, they are in our lives.

Hi all,
I just wanted to post because I'm not feeling too great at the moment. I'm juggling part time work and uni and I'm starting to get very drained. I spend every weekend all day at work and come home to study and do assignments and still don't get enough done and I have shifts every day except for wednesday and thursday when I have full classes at uni and try to get my work done. I'm feeling really overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. I was in a similar situation last year but for some reason then I was coping well and this semester I just feel like my head is going to explode
Literally at the end of last year most of my close friends moved away for different reasons and I feel not having any of them around is also taking a toll and I'm starting to feel very alone. I feel like I don't have the time though to try making new friends right now because I just want to focus and get uni done but every day I just feel myself getting more and more down and I'm starting to feel like I can't cope. I've been waiting for so long for my work to hire someone new so I don't have to work as much as I am but they just keep screwing around with it.. even though they get heaps of applications they take forever to just pick one person to interview them then most of the time it doesn't end up working out. I've really been wanting to quit this job because I'm tired of it and my boss is really selfish, but i can't just have no income and i can't even get centrelink because I've been studying for longer than I should have been.  I've tried applying for other jobs when i get the time but i don't really hear back from them..
Anyway I just really would love on how people cope with this kind of thing because I feel like im reaching my limit and i just feel lost about what i should do.. I feel like i should just suck it up and just get through this semester but at the same time I feel so awful every day and I'm only just feeling more and more awful as time goes on.. but yeah if anyone has any advice that would greatly appreciated!

So my research has said that people with BPD have seriously low self esteem, check. Apparently growing up we didn't get the validation and emotional support, check. 
Im struggling big time, I let a man know a few weeks ago I had feelings for him and he had no idea and didn't feel the same way, I've been feeling completely pathetic since. 
Im sure we will discuss this Monday in therapy. I just wish I had someone on my side that I could talk to and work through it with. I finally understand now why I get angry at my Dad, I'd talk to him about what I'm stressing over and he says nothing, then I crack it and say I don't know why I bother talking to you. I definitely don't talk to my Mother, she throws everything back in my face. 
Sorry, just feeling so lost.

Hello,
I am seeking advice on how I approach help for depression/anxiety.
My backstory…In 2014, my Dad passed away in my 2nd year of Uni, which took a hard toll on my physical and mental state. I gained a lot of weight and was upset all the time. It affected my work and also my relationships with people. Being an only child, my Mum and I didn’t talk about it much which also didn’t help. The following years I began to pick myself up I started to change my diet and activities and lost a lot of weight, I was healthier and happier. I believed my personality changed from that and my confidence has not been the same.

However over the years, a couple times a month I fall into this depressive state, where I get soo upset over little things, I get frustrated easily, I cry and think so negatively. This week I reacted to something that was said to me and instantly blew it up out of proportion to myself and got worked up (not publicly but once I’m by myself). Last year I was given medication by my GP for my anxiety because my hands constantly shake (they still do a little) but I never continued them. I am not aware of any family members or friends who have gone through these feelings and I don’t think I am comfortable bringing it up to them.
Also, the next day or even an hour after the moment of being in this state or frame of mind, I calm myself down and relax, then to me it seems like I’m fine and that everything is ok…But really deep down I don’t think it is.

Sorry, back on track…So what I am really asking is: 
- If I was to try and seek help, how do I initiate this conversation? I have never approached someone about how I’m feeling (Other than my partner, who is supportive and wants me to see someone). 
- Is this a normal thing to be stuck with depressive and negative thoughts, then soon after calm down and think that everything is ok and that you were just having a moment? Would this behaviour be causing me to not seek help?

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated,
Thank you

Hi,
My name is Sharny and I've visited here some 8 months or so ago.  I'm feeling a bit lonely in thought right now and just feel the need to talk in an environment where I know others are facing similar issues.    At times I just feel a swirl of emotion, I'll wake up and feel I've let everyone down, I'll feel guilt for being me and it's a horrible feeling. I've had to scale down the amount of activity I engage in because the pace my family and I were keeping was driving my state into a knot. I tried making each Sunday apart from commitments that come along on occasion, a day of 'free' time, that is no commitments. It worked for about a month. We decided on that day if we'd like to take it easy, have unplanned spontaneous time to mearly just walk, ride bike, cook at home or what ever.  Our lives have so many activities between both kids sports on Saturdays and week nights already that for family health one day per week Mum had formulated non-scheduled time.  For me, it became like needing air, food or water. Space to be just what ever. I could get up and be non-scheduled, non organised.Recently a friend wanted our family to join them on a Sunday, for which we did.  Then she was asking every Sunday and it become 4 consecutive Sundays in a row of getting together, BBQ lunch from 11am then afternoon still together and pizzas by dinner and all of us were still together socializing until 7pm or so. I'm lucky to have such people as are my family. But...You see, I feel this is the only spot I can even describe without feeling like a complete outcast, my feelings of disgust at myself.  I 'needed' our Sunday's free for my mental health.  But because I felt like I was rejecting her I just kept saying yes.  I touched on the fact that I require at least some of our Sundays to just be unplanned but she looked at me like what?? I find its beautiful requesting our company, but I strangely can't keep up every weekend. I told her, for my mental health I require to slow things and cant be out or entertaining every Sunday. I organised our lives to accomodate a need and it just doesnt work.  There seems to be no room for looking after mental illness. I feel like no one gets it. I just feel horrible, I feel like I try to accomodate my illness in a busy family but it doesnt match what's going on for other friends, people.  So I'm heading down the track again of putting aside what I need and going with what's expected. I don't want us to loose people because I can't keep up.

Hi guys, I suffer from depression/ anxiety and I'm not very well right now . I thought maybe talking to someone that is going through the same thing might help me. I haven't left my house for over a year now and when I do I get anxiety attracts and start sweating shaking and feeling really sick in my stomach or if I no I have to go somewhere I feel so sick in my stomach for days. I have trouble leaving my room and being that mom, wife I should be. I am letting my family down so much and they r not really understanding. I'm not sure where or what to do anymore ..

Hi All, 
 I just wanted to reach out and tell a little bit of my story in hopes that I can help someone with their struggles. I have suffered from body dysmorphic disorder for majority of my life with only realising it was a serious issue a few years ago. My BDD is focused toward my stomach and the constant feeling and fear of being fat. 
I grew up very overweight through my childhood which lead to a lot of teasing, no self confidence,anxiety and depression which has stayed with me and only gotten worse into my adulthood  (I am now 26). 
I found that through the gym and fitness I began to feel a lot better as most people do, so I decided to take it to the next level and work towards a bodybuilding competition,striving for that illusive 6 pack of abs I had always dremt about,little did I know this would make everything a million times worse. I became obsessive over trying to get lean enough to get a 6 pack when I wasn't getting to my goal the anxiety towards food and depression began to kick in. I did eventually do a show, however it was a very bad decision as it amplified all of my mental health issues. I thought if I got that 6pack it would fix all of my issues, I was so very wrong!
I am now working towards a healthy,fit and happy lifestyle where I am accepting of my body and how I look. I still have my bad days but overall things are getting much better.
I could go on and on into much more detail but will leave it there. Please reach out if you have had any similar issues or just want to talk about anything, I want to help. 
:)

Hi I have clinical depression and anxiety, I'm on a disability allowance. I'm 56. I come from emotionally abusive relationships. I have 4 children,one still at home. It looks like I'm doing great. I have a passion for needlework and quilting and I am blessed to have all the stuff I need to create. This sounds ridiculous I know. Sometimes I am frozen still with the knowing that other people are out there earning a living and I'm not. I've been called a bludger by x partner for this and it sticks. I teach my skills at the local shop and I have lots to do but the guilt makes everything unenjoyable. Even when I'm doing things I love I am thinking negative thoughts continuously and it seems like I have to push myself to do even fun things. I all sounds like crap and when I'm well I can see the sillyness of it all. This is a major problem for me. Mostly feeling very useless and unworthy. Does anyone else feel like this?

Yesterday morning, I got out of bed, ready to face the day, as it was the day I got to see Shannon Noll perform. Excited as I was, I thought 'Nothing can destroy this moment!'. Boy, was I ever way wrong. I received a message via my Facebook messenger, from my birth sister, Caitlin, stating that my birth father Ken, was diagnosed with cancer, and that the kemo treatments he was receiving, were not working for him as well as they should have been, and that he now may not have much longer. When I found my birth father, Ken, it felt to me, like I finally found where I belonged in this insane world, that I finally knew who I was, and why I was here. All my life, I had always felt like I never fit in anywhere, like I didn't belong. But like I said, that all changed when I found and met my birth father. And now, it feels like my spine is being ripped out of me, with the news that he may not have much longer. At first, I hated Caitlin for telling me this, I then started to feel my anger change from Caitlin, to the cancer that was attacking Ken. I refused to believe it, and  started to cry at the fact that I was losing him. I started thinking to myself, that I didn't care anymore, and that I wished it wasn't happening. My partner Jason, reminded me that I was so looking forward to seeing Shannon Noll, at a venue close to where we live, and that I'd been waiting for this moment for a long time. But he could see that I was soon going to be going down that long dark path I usually favour, whenever I get news like that so bad. He then said that he had to go out for a short while, and as I was only concerned with drinking my sorrow and depression away, he saw that I would be alright, for that short time that he was going to be gone. When he came back, he had one of our best friends with him, and said that I needed people around me.  So Jason and our friend Nathan helped me to get ready to go out to see Shannon, and they were right. It did cheer me up a little. After, we went to our favourite karaoke spot, and had a few songs each there. but after I'd come home, I found that news about Ken, started to creep back into my memories, and I find myself depressed again, and wishing it wasn't him that I will soon be losing. I'm sorry I wrote so long, but needed to get that off my chest, but right now, I don't know where else I can turn. True, my partner knows of my bad news, but the truth of the matter is, that I'm just not coping with the news of Ken losing his life to cancer.

Hello, I just need to get all of this out.  I rarely get time to myself to put my thoughts in order; my son is asleep and I usually nap when he does, but decided to use this time to write here.  
I have suffered mild depression for years, but this past year it has gotten severe; my doctor has changed and just increased my meds. I have a serious foot injury that's been ongoing nearly a year, only recently diagnosed and being treated for. I have a nearly 3 year old very active son whom I adore, but he's driving me mad as well, being the age he is.  Because I'm so depressed I have very little patience with him, especially when we are out and he's 'misbehaving' which in reality is just him being his age.  I worry so much about how my depression is affecting him.  I get angry with him and that's not fair on him and then I feel guilty which makes things worse in my head.  
My husband and I love each other but have a lot of conflict.  The other day he berated me about having meat from the shops in the fridge and not having put it in the freezer yet ""you know you can't freeze OFF meat, you know that don't you?"" I had just bought the meat the day before and was dealing with a very sick child.  He is very anal about food going off (and many other things!), yet I have never ever given us food poisoning.  It was so uncalled for and that is his attitude.  He has a lot of anxiety and his way to deal with it is to try and control things. He also deflects a lot; won't apologise for things but say ""I was just joking"" or ""But you do it too"".  Anyway, after the meat incident I finally said out loud what I'd been thinking for ages: We have to go for counselling or we have to split up. I cannot take it anymore.  I feel I take all the blame and my depression often gets the blame. Good news is he agreed to counselling and he has organised our first appointment for Monday.
I'm not from Australia. I have been here 10 years and while I sort of have some friends, I don't feel I have ""my people"" or anyone I can just ring and say 'hey let's go get a drink' or hang out with and vent.  I don't feel like I've really settled in here.  Whereas hubby did grow up here. Of course, if we were to go back to my country it wouldn't be the same, as all my friends have moved on. 
Anyway, in a nutshell I'm really struggling. I have lots of projects to do at home but no energy or motivation to do them.  I struggle just to do the daily things. 
Thanks all for listening.

Hi, 
About a year ago, I left my partner of 11 years which devastated me, and still does. When I met him, everything that I'd never been sure of, I suddenly was. I have had a chronic illness since I was young and I had never felt truly accepted, until he came along and showed me what life could be like when someone works with what you can do and can't do. It was never an issue to him. He was my soulmate, but there was also another side to him. In arguments he would turn violent and mean, and it hurt so much that my best friend could turn on me so swiftly. It kept escalating over the years, interspersed was the person I loved. Anyway, I've been on my own for a year now and I'm going through a particularly bad flare of my condition and I honestly wonder how I will ever meet anyone again in this state. My house is a mess, I haven't washed, my clothes are terrible and I feel miserable. A part of my thinks what a fool I was to leave and think I deserved better.

Hello fellow humans,
I have an issue that I would like to discuss.
Throughout my life I keep getting this reoccurring feeling of agony in my soul. I don't understand it, what it wants, how to satisfy it, how to make it go away.
I can't even fully describe it, it's like a feeling of being stuck, trapped, confined and having your soul screaming for something but you can't understand the words. What is it that it wants?
I've had many changes through my life and yet this feeling keeps coming back, it doesn't stay with me all the time but when it returns, it's very painful.
I have family, I've had friends, I've had great love, I've had different jobs, I've lived in the city and country, I've had money, I've gotten to my goal weight, I am healthy, I have freedom, I've been to church, I've prayed, I've meditated, I've pursued hobbies that interest me, my belief systems have changed, I've had fun, I've developed self esteem and self love, I am very self aware and I both work on my problems and reflect on things. There are times when I have suffered from depression and anxiety and there are times when I have been mentally happy and healthy.
I am grateful for the good things I have and have had.
Yet despite everything, this feeling returns.
I am in no danger of self harm, I have no intention of suicide.
But I cannot stand feeling this way anymore, I want to know if there are other people who experience this? I don't know if this is a depression issue.
Does anyone understand it?
Does anyone have any ideas as to how to satisfy the beast? How to heal whatever it is?

Hi all, I'm new here.
I'll try to keep this short.
On Friday I perked up the courage to go see a Uni councillor to talk about my decline in mental health over the past few months, particularly this past month where it's been almost daily and I have become too fatigued to function (but have to function in order to keep my life going with work etc.) this is regardless of how much sleep I have had. I wake tired, and that level didn't change all day. I made about 5 GP appointments and cancelled them all over the last few months, as I have a complex where I feel as though I am faking what ever I am feeling (I think this has something to do with upbringing and being called a drama queen my whole life).
Anyway, the Uni councillor did a screening test with me in which I rated high for depression and anxiety. She booked me in with the school GP (she's fantastic) the same day so I wouldn't avoid it. I went, she diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and prescribed me medication and set up a plan for me and some referrals to good psychs. I felt relieved, I felt like someone believed me and it was a relief to know that was I was experiencing wasn't something I've made up in my head.
I'm now waking up to day 4 on the anti-D's (the side effects were a little less harsh yesterday thank god but still there), but I've woken up today with this overwhelming sense that I need to stop and that nothing is wrong with me and that I feel extremely guilty and selfish and stupid for even seeing a doctor because none of this is real.
My fiance and I don't talk about it much - which is fine with me, he doesnt know how to deal with it so he just tries to cheer me up and we kinda avoid conversation about whats going on - which is fine because none of it overly concerns him. The problem is, last night in jest I said something about the medication and his response was ""You don't even need them"". And this really hurt me. Because I had yet another person in my life reject what I was going through. I don't think he meant to hurt me, I think his mentality is that he has seen his brother and dad go through pretty severe depression and bipolar and maybe I don't equate to that, or maybe it's that he feels I shouldn't be depressed and if I am maybe it's because of him. I don't know. It's irrelevant anyway, my post here today is to hopefully talk to people who have felt similar? I don't know how to deal with it. I keep thinking I need to get off the medication (I promise I won't).

Hi, I was just wondering how do you know if you have depression?  I have thought about killing myself because I' m not afraid of dying isn't the unknown what gets me. Thinking about my family also stop me from doing it because I don't want to hurt them.  But I don't see the point in life and I just want it to end already, and I often think can accident just happen to me so I don't get labelled a cowed.

First post here. Sadly lots of problems and very little solutions.

I'm 32 and am struggling to keep it together after a string of bad decisions in my 20s coupled with some poor socialisation in my youth that has led me to a very desperate point.

I have been unable to find ANY work for almost 18 months. I used to be a youth worker in my previous role, but I couldn't find another agency that would hire me despite them being apparently desperate for staff, and being out of work so long means I've lost all my skills... I'm stuck in the holy trinity of unemployable: too old, zero experience, too much education with no qualifications from it.

I tried to complete a bachelor of nursing 2010-2015; but had to quit due to bullying, then moved to a bachelor of arts doing sociology that I have completed a minor in so far, but centrelink has cut me off from austudy. I did a certificates and diplomas in music industry before that and a whole lot of good that achieved... Basically I am no longer allowed to study to try and improve my employability.

I cannot even get a job pushing trolleys at coles because I'm not the ""exploitable"" type. It was dehumanising.

I tried volunteering with two separate community organisations in fields that I used to thoroughly enjoy; servicing the elderly migrants and teaching refugee kids English, but without any income my will to continue just evaporated.
I got a white card and several certificates that are useful for trades, but unless I'm under 20 tradies don't want a bar of me.
I didn't get my first job until I was 27 as an assistant in nursing and I cannot go back to the health and support industry due to PTSD from the bullying (undiagnosed, but avoiding the whole industry is all I need to keep it in check).

I have a string of issues that keep me out of certain industries: I can't work nights due to the mood destabilisation from sleep deprivation, I cannot work sales due to anxiety. I cannot cold call businesses due to anxiety either, and I struggle at the best of times to send in job applications because rejections REALLY badly affect me psychologically.
What are some suggestions for PAID entry level work. I need cash, not experience.
I am at the point of considering picking up a drug habit just so it would make a pension claim easier because of all the horror stories I have read of trying to apply with mental health alone :(

Hey :) 

I ask out of interest, learning & gathering info for my purposes which are to get on top of Bipolar (BP)
Flog the demons & when I get there thinking to public speak (Paid hopefully) & would help many. 
A goal I HAVE to reach.
Our depression beyond eventually goes when we've recovered fortunately.

Questions: 



Sufferers of depression: 
Does it lift at times during depression? 

Do you find you get depressed when tired? 
(I've spoken to a few over the yrs with/out M.Illness or ? undiagnosed, but most have said no. I always have but may have been the BP.)

A Psychiatrist said the depression causes tiredness which I get why but...
I'm not so sure, I think other way round too but might be wrong, open to that

Cheers

So I got diagnoses with BPD looking back at myself and who I am I see it I just don't know how to handle it. I completely disassociate myself and generally reflect a lot of anger. I don't know how to help myself. I am doing all my psychiatrist asked me to. And onto of that I have relationship problems that I don't know how to handle and so I just shut off and push everyone away or yell at them for pushing me. Need some help figuring this out because no-one is really helping me understand.

I have realised in the last 12 months that I have no emotion, I don't feel sad, happy, angry, I just don't feel any emotion whatsoever. I find that I say things or express love for people because I know I do love them but I express this I feel it is expected of me. 
And I don't want to hurt peole close to me so I do this to save any hurt, but deep down there is no emotion at all, and I have really noticed the last few months even more, I have an amazing boyfriend and would do anything for me but I am finding it increasingly hard to show emotion to him, and I feel that is not fair to him so I should break up with him so he has the chance of a more fulfilling life with someone who can show this to him.
So the dilemma and constant battle in my head is why I feel like this and what I should do in regards to my partner and what's best for both of us going forward.
Any advice at this point would be much appreciated

Over the last three months i have been doing therapy for the first time for depression. Its been a roller coaster of emotions. My husband has been a great support.
I hit bottom, couldn't go to work and thought id lost my best friend cos of the way I treated her. After her yelling at me down the phone we reconciled. 
I've been doing much better the past few days but i still feel like I'm relying on others too much. I get disappointed when friends don't return messages or doesn't initiate contact with me. I am lonely when I'm by myself.  I also get jealous when my best friend does things with her other friends.  I really really can't go through a repeat of last month.
I want to be happy with my own company and not feel like I'm waiting for people to make contact all the time. 
Can anyone share and experiences? ?

Hi first time on line have been seeing psychologist  for a couple of sessions.Guess it is a start i hope this talking thing does help. I was brought up to not cry and not show your emotions. I am now 54 year old female,that simply woke up one day ceeling broken. My way to describe it being fractured and needing to be fixed.I am not who i always was i feel i am drifting so far down a shitty slope if i get a cold or something minor wrong in my life Nothing matters anymore and feel Take that last step if this is all my life is now.And then the fight to live begins again.But then something minor triggers it of again and i get tired of trying to hang on to life.It would be one last sad thing for my family then they could get on with there lives and i would not have to fight this battle that keep,s lingering around the corner.Deppression ad the constant shakes with shot nerve,s is relentless. SO TIRED.But i am still fighting it Can someone reasure me therapy and talking fixes this because i can not see how reliving stuff and opening up all built up things helps not makes worse thank,s for listening in advance..

For the last two years my life has been in turmoil.
My mum died, then my gran, I got diagnosed with depression, then my partner of 8 years became addicted to ice, that resulted in him losing his senses and becoming literally crazy.
Then the police raided our house twice, which was really traumatic because both times I was home by myself and they tore my home apart. I have never committed a crime in my life.
I then found myself in lockup and then in court getting a drugs charge purely because I live in the same house as my partner. (I do not use drugs of any kind)
Things seemed to come good for a little while- my partner got clean, I saw a psychologist and took medication which all helped.
Now, however, things seem worse than ever.
I haven't seen my partner in a week or heard from any other family or friends. I have never experienced loneliness like this and it is crippling. I feel trapped in this misery.
Even my pets, hobbies and friends all of which has always helped me so much- I now feel like I hate them all.
I feel so isolated but I am stuck.
I decided to leave my partner, I packed my things but now I feel like I have no where to go. Which is making me feel more isolated.
The pain is so bad that I just don't know what to do anymore.
Throughout everything that has happened, its like I am always standing still and all this stuff just happens around me and I cant do anything about it.
Is life really meant to be this hard?

Im new here, joined up today. I'm a 25 year old male, im employed, have a wife and 3 beautiful kids. I'm having trouble with my mind that i don't understand. I getting EVERDAY feelings/thoughts that use to be an uncommon occurrence  (every few months). When I was younger I got really bad night terrors where I would half wake up, life wasn't reality and i would feel as though i was looking out my own eyes but being controlled by someone else, at times i slepwalked my fists/head through windows and jumped off balconies. Now what im feeling as of late is not as severe but I'm in a similar headspace. I find myself asking all the ""what is life"" questions and i freak out as though I am not the one living my own life some of the time and that someone else is going to take over and im going to lose touch with reality or do something stupid. I'm trying to do my best to explain how i feel but its hard to put it to words. I haven't seen anyone i dont understand what is going on or why. I did have some trauma as a teenager my older brother and my best friend died and i dabbled with drugs and depression afterwards, i don't know if that has anything to do with it. Just wondering what i should do? I hate feeling not 100% in control of my life and paranoid something is going to happen to my mind. Thanks

Hello guys,
 I am totally new to any kind of forum and any sort ofor public communication about my feelings. 
I just thought I would express how I'm feeling and see if anyone has any tips for me.
In life I have good family support, financial security, a loving husband and a roof over my head. So it seems so silly and selfish to complain about anything.
But at the same time I often wake feeling sad. I have days where I feel like I am different from everyone else. Days where washing up a plate seems like too much effort. I don't worry about the things most people my age do but I worry about other things like the planet and the way society is going and our unsustainable lives. I don't worry all the time though. I'd never say I was anxious at all. All I mean is I feel quite distant from everyone else a lot of the time and end up feeling empty. Sometimes I feel like the world we have created for ourselves isn't one I want to live in and just want to run off and live in the woods where I would have real problems like food and water not silly friendship stuff or money stuff.
 Does anyone else ever feel this way?
 
Thanks.
S.

Hello followers,
I came across this forum just this morning, out of sheer desperation. I had been crying all morning and needed to know that I'm not the only one who feels like this.
As far as everyone knows, I'm great. Happy go lucky, a sweet job, a family who loves me a beautiful daughter and caring husband. I smile through my day but feel like I'm living a lie. Am I happy, no, am I overwhelmed, yes, do I feel noticed, important or appreciated, no. It's exhausting...im ALWAYS tired! I have a history of anxiety, I can't even remember when it started but it's been probably close to ten years. I've seen doctors, then put me on a care plan, I see a counsellor for my 5 sessions or whatever it is, they give me medication and I'm on my way. This was the case a few years ago now, I was in denial but it was the deal I made with my husband so we could start a family, but looking back (I was so young) I'm not finished.. My issues remain un resolved. I went to my gp prob 3 months ago and gently touched on it again and asked about another care plan (I simply cannot afford $150 a week/session to see someone) and see sent me home with the k10, so of course, I felt like she didn't take me seriously and I never went back. I pulled that k10 out this morning and did it, it told me I was high and suggested I see a doctor. I'm really struggling with that first step. I've been minimising my feelings and mental health for so long, that I can't even be completely open with a doctor. I want help, I want a better life, I forget how it feels to be happy and content. What do I say to a doctor, how do I take that first agonising, scary step??

Right now I feel pretty hopeless. 4 month old twins and PND and anxiety since about 4 weeks in getting worse over time. Right now I am struggling to see how I will ever feel like I didn't make a huge mistake in having children and to have a connection with them.

Hi , 
over the past 2 years I've suffered panic attacks and anxiety , which I sort help via cognitive therapy through  a psychiatrist.  
Unfortunately now , the old black dog has coming creeping in and I now suffer from depression.. I didn't recognise the symptoms and put them down to bad days . It was the loneliness and feelings of nothing that kept reoccurring  , my GP has medicated me now.
Im surrounded  by wonderful  family and friends who are loving and caring .  I own my own business with my partner of almost 20 years , with 2 perfect kids  and I am always busy and social. 
I know I  hold my partner accountable for the way I feel , even though he can also  be my biggest supporter.  I know that stress from our business  has contributed to the way I feel - worthless if things are perfect or don't go as planned   .... 
The nothingness is so unfamiliar to me  , and hiding behind my smile is my biggest security blanket as no one would ever guess that I have black days , when I let it in and it stays with me .
How do others cope with the  loneliness, even though being  always been surrounded by people who Love you . 
thanks

Ever since I left my ex-boyfriend in North America I’ve been feeling depressed. Not crying constantly depressed, just generally feeling down, unmotivated, confused and less confident in myself. The world seems muddled, or my mind does? Like I can’t think clearly and don’t
really know what I’m doing or what to do in general... Its really hard to explain but it kind of feels like a combination of lack of self-belief and uncertainty (I guess they’re kind of the same thing?), which I didn’t feel when I was with him (which was only two weeks ago…) 

Most things feel like a struggle but simultaneously I feel pressured to do more with my life and achieve more than usual. Bit of a conundrum! 

Also it’s really weird/frustrating but I don’t feel nearly as beautiful now that we’re not together. He made me feel
beautiful I guess. And I miss that. It would be nice to feel that way without him too. 

I am in emotional pain. And I know I’m not going to be with him for quite a while if at all so I need to get better
without him. I want to feel really good again. Currently, we’re not together. We’re worlds apart. Literally.  

The context: 
I’m (F26) from Australia. Earlier this month, I spent a week with him (M27) in America, which is where he now lives. We dated for a year and a half before breaking up about a year and a half ago due to his move overseas (for some fancy shmancy job). We had a great time together in the States but there were many tears upon saying our goodbyes and it’s been hard ever since. 

Because it’s been really hard I texted him the other day saying that I think it’s best we don’t meet up when he visits Aus at the end of this year. Now we’re not really talking… Hard to go from being so in love and happy together to absolutely nothing. We never didn’t work, he just strongly felt the need to live overseas on his own for a while. While I understand why he did what he did and deep down I know he loves me, it’s still really frustrating to go on living my life as a single woman while he’s living on the other side of the world, with no real plans for the future...

Joined two minutes ago. Having bad days for first time in a long time and felt the need to talk. I don't really want people to know I've gone backwards. 
I've been transitioning off meds. And yesterday it suddenly all hit like a bolt. I was back to being the terrible, screaming, bad tempered, irrational, weepy mother that I haven't been in so long.  And it SHOCKED me. How awful I was.  Because I forgot. And because that was what my kids had to deal with for so long. They are such beautiful kids and they deserve better. 
And it's so eye-opening to go from fine to that overnight. Because you really see it clearly. If it had happened that suddenly at the beginning it wouldn't have taken so long to get help. Because it was pretty obviously a sick lady.
And now I just sit. And cry.
Crap

A friend of mine wrote this and with her permission I am posting it here. This screams to me of the fight that we all go though..depression is a rough thing but despite the lies it tells us...each and every one of us is way stronger then we thought!
And he said to her ""You're worthless.""She bowed her head in acceptance.
And he said to her ""No one could love you.""She felt the hurt each time they left.
And he said to her ""You are grotesque.""She gazed in the mirror and saw the truth in his words.
The more he said to her, the more the darkness consumed.
And he said to her ""You should rid everyone of your pathetic existence.""She raised her head and meekly replied ""No.""
The war began and every battle was hard fought. Painful sobs. Screams of victory. Agony from defeat.And he said to her ""Just give up. You are tired of fighting me. Of fighting what you know is truth. You are worthless. Ugly. Stupid. Needy. Unloved and barely tolerated. End it!""She let the tears fall freely as she looked him in the eye....""No."" 
To me this was a very strong message!
We all think that we stand alone in the dark, yet reach out my friends and you will find a hand there willing to help you into the light, to help you get back onto your feet and once again hold your head up high. You truly are worth the effort even though the depression lies and tells you that you are not! Keep fighting for YOU are worth the fight!

Hi All,
I haven't been here for quite some time but here i am back again!  Just feeling really frustrated at the moment.  Frustrated at work, really not enjoying it at the moment, too much pressure, unreasonable expectations and inconsistencies.  Not happy at home either, i doubt that i would still be there if it wasn't for my daughter.  Never ending financial stresses as well. 
So not happy at work, not happy at home, too many stresses and frustrations!  I can't eat properly because of all the stomach cramps i am getting, especially in the evenings.  Feel emotionally detached, all i feel is frustration and irritability in varying degrees.  My only savior is my strict exercise regime, gives me something to focus on and look forward too, i really don't know where i would be without it!
I guess life is what it is just gotta get on with it i suppose but definitely not enjoying life at the moment.  Irritable and frustrated!  Thanks for listening to my rant
 
Take Care :)

Hello everyone,
One of the things I seem to be struggling with is concentrating. Dissociation and obsessive thoughts aside, I seem unable to really do anything that requires mental work.
I think it's a major obstacle in me getting my life really properly on track because it means I can't work properly, and I can't write either which I want to do as a productive hobby.
I've tried things like getting up and going for a walk and listening to music (which is my version of mindfullness/meditation), but the best I can manage is writing stream of consciousness which I just get fed up with anyway.
Anyone have any ideas? I know I shouldn't be too hard on myself about it, but it's pretty darn infuriating.

I have suffered from anxiety and depression for a couple years now. Ironically it has been since my life took a positive and happy turn and the reality of my past began to weigh down. Since my life was positive, it made me feel like it was a happy bubble that if I wasn't careful would burst and I would be back to square 1. It has been a lot of ups and downs of believing it is a condition and is not just my persona. I spent a long time thinking it was just how I was because, hey, my life was stressful but it was full of positive things, my life was amazing, I had supportive people around me and still do, but I couldn't just sort myself out and be happy, I couldn't stop criticizing and micromanaging myself to be as positive as I was in the past. I feel angry that my past got the positive happy person that my current positive life and people deserve and that iI feel I always do or say something wrong if I don't manage myself... like I impact those around me without meaning to. I feel like if I do in fact impact those people I will lose what's important to me. Anxiety sets in. I take too much responsibility on myself to care for those around me and achieve more, and don't understand when I can't handle it and the stress that comes with it. I have this need to constantly test and push myself because 'I have to be able to do better and be better'. I have progressed to being very internal because in a lot of cases I work myself into the ground and convince myself that I cannot change because I cannot cope and I am exhausted. I am overemotional, I just feel too much, consider too much, consider too many different options or reasons I may feel that way or how I may make someone else feel that way. I recently found out my husband finds it to be hard work being around me as he is always trying to make me happy but only succeeds for short periods of time before I recede again because I feel irrational that I have done something wrong. People ask what I'm thinking, and trying to capture my thoughts and express them is like trying to catch confetti in a wind tunnel, each confetti piece being a thought.  
I am working on being more self-aware and have been seeing a counselor,  but I'm just wondering if there are others that experience this and if they have advice. I feel like I can't express myself to my counselor, but I just hope someone out there understands and it's not just me. I'm working on myself, I know I can get through it I just don't know HOW.

Hi Everyone,
 I've been going through a tough time the last 12 months. Loss of job due to sexual harassment & bullying that lasted a long time and slowly been coming to terms with the situation. Now at university trying to follow another career path. I am having difficulties distinguishing depression from normal down feelings. How do you know for sure its depression? When a doctor ask me how I feel I struggle to answer. My daily routine is get up around 6-7am, have coffee and study, by 10-11am I am back in bed. the general feeling I have is that I need a rest but I feel that something else may be going on under the surface. Am I hiding from something? Am I really that tired each day? do I really have a cold? I just can't figure it out and why I am going to bed so much. 
 I do try leave the house, I have some shows I enjoy watching, books I like read. I do stuff but i am not consistent, theres no balance and the sleeping takes over. I feel like I could be trying to get away from something or a feeling but I don't know what it is. I am seeing a GP, psychologist and psychiatrist one told me when I feel like going to bed just go for a run...thats easier said than done. I struggle with chores, paying bills, appointments and sometimes brushing my hair. I just don't care. I wish I knew why though.
 Any thoughts would be great.

Hi all 
I feel really weird for posting this because I've raised this before with a few people who think that I am crazy. 
Is it possible to be psychic triggered by your mental illness? 
I have tested the theory more than once and have been right each time. 
It's not things like lotto numbers or telling the future like a clairvoyant claims to be. 
It's a feeling I get inside my heart of people, I can feel what they feel and it's enough to alert me to their pain or sorrows. Or I dream that people are in trouble etc
These things then turn out to be correct. 
I'm a very intelligent woman, straight A student, HD's at uni etc So I'm not the type to buy into things if I didn't have solid facts. 
But people think I'm crazy and because I was diagnosed bipolar last year it's easy to just lumber me into a category etc etc 
Having said that I never felt so deeply about people as I have since been diagnosed last year. I feel my emotions are heightened and I feel auras of emotions by been in a room.. It's quite painful for me. 
If you don't have anything nice to say, don't type it, I don't feel like be bagged out for what I'm saying here. 
But was just hoping someone might be able to understand and relate without judging. 
The experience is painful for me. These are emotions I don't want to be feeling when I have my own emotions and problems to be dealing with. 
Thank you x

Hi everyone,
Ive posted a few times in the past and things seem to be going okay then I get somewhat blindsided by something totally out of left field. This is another one of those occasions.
im nearly a 40 year old man who lives and works in the LGBTIQ community, I'm typically surrounded by supportive people most of the time and whilst I am grateful, I can't help but think that they don't actually know me and if I wasn't around then they wouldn't notice. I'm sure a few people are saying I'm being melodramatic and sometimes I even think that. I feel isolated from those around me, I rarely get asked to do things with others and when I ask people to do things I often get no response.
 I feel lonely just about all the time and it is getting harder to cope with these feelings, most people my age have families, partners and something to show for their life. I don't have any of these things. The person I class as my best friend is a lot younger than me, also my ex partner who I live with. They've just started a new relationship and I feel like our friendship isn't important to them anymore. It may sound like I'm jealous and in some ways I am but not in the way you would think. I miss that companionship etc it's hard to explain without getting emotional.
Im just struggling to cope with everything right now, feeling really lost and questioning my place in the world. I keep thinking that after nearly 40 years of life I should just be able to just move on, make new friends and not dwell on the loneliness.

I've been medicated for depression for about twenty years.  Last year I lost my dad, my mother in law and a great friend to cancer.  As a result of this I descended into a severe depressive episode that's been going on for over a year.  I've hardly worked, been on a range of new medications and was even in hospital for a few days.  More recently I have started seeing a psychiatrist.  He fiddled with my meds.  Since the last alteration I feel good.  No tears, and the feeling of sadness and being on the edge is pretty much gone.  But it's been replaced by guilt.  I feel so bad that my wife is out working supporting the family while I'm at home.  The dr says my recovery will be a long term thing and even once my depression is controlled it will be a long time before I have my confidence back (I'm a teacher).  I've got myself into a routine which my therapist suggested but I just feel so bad that I'm not contributing.  It almost makes me miss the lows of my depression.

hi all ,I have been suffering long term depression ,anxiety and ptsd caused by a number of things but have recently been plagued by digestive problems ,doctor seems to think i am creating the problems myself and that its all associated to my mental health .
can any 1 else relate to this ? am I doing this to myself ? or is there other factors in play here ? without a heap of invasive tests that I might put myself through for no real reason I might never know .
if others have had this same problem then could you describe your symptoms ,this may help me a lot in working out if its me or something else and give me the drive I need to pull out of this or get the medical help I may need ,any help would be appreciated

Hi, Im new. Sorry a bit useless with the site, but Ive just joined. I was carted off by my daughter to my physchiatrist last week and he told me I was depressed and I didnt even recognise it. I have been on Anti depressants for about ten years, quite a high dose actually but with many very stressful things happening to me, a death, diagnosis of a grandchild with autism, and two medical issues ontop of each other I went down hill. I couldnt get off the bed for months. I have a thyroid condition, Hashis so thought my tiredness and being exhausted was due to that. My husband has put up with three years of ill health due to that trying to get me medicated properly. I dont blame him but since last week he seems angry with me, (hes overseas for work and hadnt even asked if Im okay. He left day after diagnosis. He has sent me some angry texts and I almost feel like hes trying to blame me for my depression. Hes a good man but dosnt understand depression. I actually think hes depressed now himself. I dont blame him for being frustrated because I have been tired, grumpy and suffering social anxiety for years.

I am currently on disability and am at home most of the day.
I do have friends but they are a long way away.
I have tried to go to the library and do other things but can't seem to find anything to distract or occupy myself.
My medication is giving me brain fog and I keep drooling but not sure what I can do about that.
I am sleeping but not sure if straight through and I keep going to bed so early I wake up early.
I just want something to look forward to so I don't feel like I am wasting my time.

Most nights I lie in bed telling myself how useless I am, I am not worth anything, the world will still function without me. I am working full time and studying at nights where I find myself easily distracted. Then I start hitting myself (just with words) saying how useless I am, why didn’t
I just study and do the work. Why can’t I? Not doing the work just makes me stay up the next night, but the same thing happens. Why can’t I just do the work!! I could then go to bed with my wife, she must feel lonely, it is my fault. I am useless.  I am a useless, no hoper Idiot. It’s not
just study. Why couldn’t I ring that person today for work, why couldn’t I pick up the phone and ring? Why couldn’t I send that email, I now what I need to say and do, why can’t I do it? I know my manager thinks I can’t do my job. I know I can, but why can’t I?

Am I a failure? I do have a beautiful family that I love dearly. My kids love me, I think, no yes they do (why do I sometimes think that they wouldn’t?). My wife says she loves me. So why do I think that she would be better off without me? I feel sometimes that my kids might be
better off without me, but I know they would be better with me. I keep waiting for my wife to tell me that’s it, that I am useless and she has found someone else that makes her happy. But she hasn’t yet?

Why can’t I talk to my wife about this? I go through all these emotions at night, and tell myself that in the morning I will talk to someone about this. Then in the morning I feel fine. I say to myself, that I am just being an emotional cry-baby at nights get over it you idiot, your fine. I tell no-one.

What is the difference between depression / anxiety and it just being the person you are? What if what I feel is just me, not some disorder that can be fixed? Can being shy, intrinsic and wanting to be alone be mistaken for depression? What if I am imagining these depression feelings to hide what I am? What If I am trying to mask the person I am (compared to the person I want to be) by trying to make myself think I have depression / anxiety, which stops me being the person who I want to be?

I feel like I am useless, what if I actually am? What if going down the path of trying to find if I have depression / anxiety I find that I do not have it? And I am really just a hopeless, useless idiot? Would it be easier to have something to hold on to to blame than find out the truth that I am a failure?

hi just going over (and over and over) old stuff here I know...and all I have has been written about already, but I still can't seem to work, move, be a part of the world, focus, feel, try.

There have been some brilliant posts about how to overcome that feeling of ""nothingness"", having a bad day or just feeling like there's something missing in your heart and finding something to fill it.
I thank you all for posting up the initial question or feeling - very brave of you - and to all those who replied with helpful tips or how you feel too/your agreement - you guys rock!....
But.... 
I'm going to be ""Norbert the Negative"" here and say what if even THEN you can't get up and move - do something or feel anything at all?
What if you've tried everything and just blah - you just feel blank all the time anyway? I mean ALL the time. Not just ""having a bad day"" or being a little down for a couple of days, i mean 24/7 every day of the year.

Ok sometimes i feel a bit happy, sometimes I even show that, but mostly inside, i have no feelings at all. There's just nothing. 

Background here - forgive me for rambling and making NO sense....i haven't been able to be all that amicable with others, communicate clearly and with well-thought out answers, think straight or even be comprehensible for a while now: 
I'm not on drugs (meds, nor that illegal shite)! 
I do sleep, but lately that sleep is all over the place and tonight I've had none at all. That's kinda normal for me - mainly due to the points above and below. 

Relationships:
I have an amazing, wonderful, laid-back, easy going, patient and very supportive boyfriend. He's amazing....but i hate to say this, I don't feel anything for him. It's not that I don't love him! I do, well, i think i do. I really appreciate him, for sure! 
He's like no one I've ever met! He's so good to me, treats me beautifully, the way I've always wished I could be treated....So why am I not happy?  Its frustrating. I don't feel something - I don't feel the way he shows me love. It's weird. I never used to be like this. I would give my heart 100% to those around me and was abused for it, now I'm being treated well, I just cant give even 1% - or it seems to me that way.
To be continued...

A bit of a back story. I came from a dysfunctional family. At 11 my dad left and around that time I became my mums fulltime carer. She had a baby a few years later and I quit school and started raising him while taking care of her. I took care of her for 23 years and he's now a 21 yo. She passed away last year and I've since been diagnosed with depression anxiety and PTSD. Today after getting into an argument with my brother (he was angry at me) I realized I have no idea of who I really am. I dont know what I like or what I pretend to like. I always seem to go along with whatever other people are saying. I never disagree with anyone because I dont want them to hate me. I know the relationship with my mum was codependent i would never get mad at her in case she got mad or it caused an arguement. I also act different and my likes chsnge depending who im with. Im so confused right now

I've been doing a lot of reading trying to find a placeholder for how I feel. I came across a reference to 'sehnsucht'. This post is for those who haven't come across it before. It is a German word for an emotion that we don't have a direct translation for in English. It fits me perfectly. It is loosely defined as 'longing', but it is much more than this. 
I found a paper that defined it with six characteristics.
1. Utopian conceptions and striving for an 'ideal life'
2. A sense of being incomplete
3. It transverses the past, present and future
4. It is bittersweet in nature, and can drive you in good and bad ways
5. Promotes reflection on one's life
6. Closely connected with symbolism
It shares some symptoms with depression. You are not happy. You see flaws in yourself that originated in the past and the impacts of them will extend into the future. You can oscillate between being energetic (sub-manic in my case I think) and deeply down. You reflect on life and its value.
But it is different. It is grounded in a positive origin: to seek a life that is a personal utopia, strive for excellence, or chase dreams. It is the nature of this reality that causes people experiencing sehnsucht to feel excited and energetic when their goals become closer but bitterly despondent when they realise that they will never reach it because it is impossible. It is like chasing the end of a rainbow. Also, these actions are not meant to produce a tangible outcome, but rather a symbolic one. Someone who is depressed and the catalyst for these feelings is a certain thing or things usually is looking for a simple cause and effect result. Get better job, earn more money, enjoy things. Improve relationship with partner, have more fulfilling relationship, feel better about oneself. With sehnsucht though it is not of this nature. One may strive for a better job for better pay to achieve freedom. Or want to improve their relationship with their partner to understand love as it relates to the human condition. These things can never be achieved fully, and so there is sense of disappointment every time there is a reminder of this.

Hi
Last year I had a manic episode with psychotic features. I ended up in hospital for 3 weeks. I have been experiencing a low since roughly July last year...no pleasure in past activities, lack of motivation, little energy, etc This week I went to see my psych and asked him straight out what was wrong with me. He told me I had bipolar 1. He adjusted my meds which I hope works. My episode was triggered by long term high stress. Has anyone else been diagnosed with bipolar?

My depression is caused by someone I like or indulge in, even though I still consciously try to avoid that person when I'm away from them for a while. It's a cycle. It only comes back when I see the person, despite the fact that I love this person. 
My depression case is really strange and abnormal as it's rather ""contradictory"".

Hi all,
 I feel that I need to talk to others as beside my work counselor there is no one out there I can really talk to. 
History: I met my partner a year ago when her then very ill mother she was looking after died not soon after we met. Attraction was instant and love developed soon after. I lived in a big city and had nice circle of work mates with whom I had good social interactions daily. My partner was in deep grief and decided to move in with me pretty much as soon as we met, to be away form her family and to be able to process her grief. I experienced her mostly sitting on the lounge, after late night stay awake and late mornings, daily. Her main hobby/pattern is to read on her tablet (rarely let this thing down). She told me that she likes reading and that she is big introvert and sociophobe. She is more on a quite side person. In time she was staying at my place we have had some good fun but still didn't go out much at all.She also shared with me some horrific abuse stories from her past, mental issues she had and that she is on the very strong dose of pain medication. I find her more on a quiet side. After six months living together she suggested to me to move to much smaller town with her (where she was born) to be closer to her old and very fragile dad.I accepted and we moved 3 months ago. I have same full time job here and she is not working as she hasn't been for last 2 years because of looking after her ill mom 24/7. She sold her house couple of years ago and she has been using that money in every day life, money that is slowly fading away. I am on a steady job but below average pay. While living with me I was covering all bills and she was contributing by buying a groceries.
Since we moved here life has been very stressful. Constant work on the house, my new work was totally unprepared for my start so I felt extremely frustrated and unsupported. She tried her best to work at home along with me but it is hard for her as she is quite unorganised person, so there is a lot of mess inside of the house. Opposite of her I am very organised person and need some order to be able to feel comfortable in my surrounding.

If was almost 2 years ago. At the time life felt grand. I was popular, out at least 2-3 times a week, was known as the social butterfly and was a friend of everyone but in reality, a friend of no one. 

You could say I've always been an extrovert, confident, happy to approach the unknown and always the 'YES' man in most situations. The reality of being this person over many years and almost like being on 'repeat' was that I thought I had many caring friends around me when in reality all I had were people using me for an excuse to go out, get drunk and for the most part, get high off drugs. Especially when you were the financier for every outing. I felt at the time that by going out and meeting new networks that my depression was in check and I that I was in control and accepted by society. The awful truth though was that every time I got home after a big night I constantly had a thundering and abrupt visit by that person you might be familiar with known as 'depression'. 

Whenever depression came late at night and tapped me on the shoulder, the feeling was cold, sharp and straight to the heart. Sound nullified, as did any good feeling I had throughout the night and that feeling that I was 'wanted' by someone, anyone. I was in this constant routine until one night when I had a hard reality check. My minute I remember having to go the toilet and the next minute I woke up in the back of an ambulance with no memory. 16 hours of straight drinking and drugs with no food took its toll. I was scared, panicked and felt all alone.
I remembered Albert Einsteins definition of insanity: 'Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. It was time for things to change and more importantly, for me to make and action changes. 

I stopped going out for drinks and instead went out for weekend breakfasts with friends who I had known for a long time and were always there and vice versa, I changed my mobile number and stopped contacting the 'party crowd'. I substituted going out for drinks and alcohol with learning MMA and Brazilian Jui-Jitsu and eating healthy food 5-10 times a week and started watching TedTalks and further enhancing my mind. I also started guitar up again and focused on my career. I also became somewhat of a hermit crab and didn't go out for drinks for 8 months. 

Fast forward and for 2 years since changing my ways I have not been depressed since and have never been happier. 

I hope this helps and thank you for reading. 

R&R.

This is my first time posting in the forum so I'm not quite sure how this works exactly. I suffer from bipolar mood disorder, depression and anxiety. I feel that over the last couple of months I've been on a downward spiral, particularly in the last week. I am constantly exhausted, have no motivation to do anything and just feel all around hopeless. My studies are suffering because of this and I just feel worn down.
I don't like asking for help or talking about how bad things really are right now because I feel like people will think I'm overreacting. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Everyone has their own lives to worry about and I don't want to bother anyone or feel like a burden to others.

Hi Everyone 
I have bipolar ii and sleep is really an issue for me. Or should I say.. Dreams are an issue. 
It's taken me months to work on sleep hygiene and have gone from no sleep to about 6 hours a night. Mainly via my psychologist, meditation, music and some reading before bed. 
But the sleep isn't restful. It's full of dreams of me in trouble, others in trouble, running to help.. They are busy dreams that leave me feeling over whelmed in the morning. 
I have sleeping tablets but only allowed them a maximum of one night a week as my doctor doesn't want me to become addicted. 
If I take the tablets I'll sleep about 9 hours and I have no idea if I dream as I'm literally out of it and don't recall anything when I wake up. So it's more restful for me. 
Anyone have any dream issues? 
Bipolar has been difficult to manage, only diagnosed november last year and medicated, but I'm doing OK with help. 
Thanks x

 I don't really know where to start.. since December 1st 2014 my life has changed and not for the better. I went through a horrible time then and the person I was is no longer who I am. I mean I have seeked help.. was on medication but the doctor took me off cause it was not working. I've seen three councillors and I just feel so uncomfortable because I can't say what I want to say without feeling embarrassed because I cry so much.. its like I have no control over my emotions. I think the same things over and over every day.. I can't switch my memories off and its driving me crazy.. I have good periods of 2 weeks where I feel like im getting on the right track but then Im so bad again. I walk on eggs shells because Im scared of how I will react if I feel a certain feeling that upsets me. On Friday I was talking to a co worker and he did something, something that was harmless that triggered this fear inside me and I felt like I couldnt breathe.. I was over thinking everything the rest of the night.. The feeling is hard to explain.. but it is the feelings I felt on the 1st of December 2014. I was diganosed with servere Depression and Anxiety but I feel like its more than that... i feel crazy! I have isolated myself from everyone.. I don't spend time with anybody.. I tell no one anything because ive had friends and family make me feel worse telling me to"" get over it"" or ""move on""....ive made new friends at work but I am so cautious.. I don't trust anyone. Some days I lose my appetite.. Some days I emotionally eat. Just the other night I woke at 3am and just started thinking every bad thing anyone has ever said or done to me. Im either so exhausted or up and down all night. I like to be alone but Im also at a movie laughing and then start crying because I can see people with Friends or Partners.. I get so overwhelmed easy.. but get so disheartened when Im never incuded.. Its so frustrating and exhausting. Work mates pick up on my changes in behaviour and its embarrassing because I can't tell them what I feel inside.. because i have so much pain inside.. Im so lonely but so hurt that I hide away.
 Do you have any advice or suggestions to help me? I don't have a lot of money but I also know If I don't get some help Im just going to get worse.

Hi there, I don't even know where to begin. I have never been to counseling or seeked help and to be honest its probably only been the last 2-3 years that i have felt this way (this heavy) so I'm just soo confused in the head. I think about death but i could never harm myself as i don't won't it to effect anybody else. Plus my dog needs me. Funny or as sad as that is i really feel like my dog is all i have. I haven't had a great up bringing, I don't remember much at all from my childhood but i do remember there being a lot of violence. My mum and myself have a very toxic relationship and i feel like a lot of my emtional state comes from her. I have never felt good enough and always felt like i need to prove my worth to her where she would over compensate with my two younger brother's (one who's 2yrs younger has server depression & another who's 8yrs younger was always sick as a child). I know she love's and cares for me but its like she doesn't bother proving it. We have always fought my whole life growing up. I am very gypsy with my nature and an empath where my mother who was very much a gypsy before having us was very judgmental and critical, especially about one's looks. I have always struggled with my weight and and growing up we were all on a pretty strict no fat foods no sugar diet. The middle brother was alway the better looking one, the skinny one and the most popular one but i feel because of all that plus his depression and anxiety mum put a lot of herself into him an blamed me for a lot of his wrong doings or blaming me for the way he is almost. I get really emtional when i talk about my feelings but especially when that comes to talking to my mother. I turn into a nervous wreak and breakdown.

Ok, so I've never written anything before but I'm not sure where else to turn.
Ive been suffering severely for nearly 5 years now. I was a successful builder up until then running my own company with a young family at my feet.
In 2013 I was admitted into hospital with severe anxiety and depression and have been unable to work since.
My wife is now our income earner and I am the stay at home dad. Something I'm really struggling with and have a huge amount of guilt about. My depression seems to never have really gone away with me having been in and out of hospital and trying every drug under the sun.
I guess I'm just wondering if there are any other guys out there going through anything similar because when I look at what my male friends and family are doing and achieving in life I feel hopeless and alone

 My mum moved away to sydney with my youngest brother when i was 20 and left my middle brother who was 18. He was horrible and very abusive when he drunk which was every weekend. I worked over 50hrs a week managing a busy hair salon and weekend's i was pretty much always working so when it came to Friday night's i knew i was in for it and also did my mum as i would ring and ring her for help because he's having a party or wont turn the music down etc etc. Not once did she come to help or fixed the situation let a lot listen. Now fast forward to age 27 it's happening again. I am left with the house and she move away but this time she has met the man of her dreams. I have a lot a pressure on me at the moment with owning my own business and making ends me especially with rent (living in sydney sucks). Im over my job but im stuck in it because i can't get out because of the money. Mum sold our house our only security and moved 4 hours away. That house she sold she bought from the house that we sold with our abusive stepfather. The house that we were abused in while she watched just so ""we could have a better life"". Yet she sells ""our better life"" for her new man that i have onlt met 3 times within 2 years. I have a lot i issues i know regarding my mother. She doesn't understand. I only broke down a few weeks ago to her about all my feelings, emotions and issue's that i have with life and with her and her words where ""can't you move on and just get over it"". And that has stuck to me. What's wrong with me. Why can't i let go of everything and everyone that's every hurt me. Why can't i forgive the word's that they have said or haven't said. Why can't i just better happy. I don't even know if this will make sense i just needed write something down. Thank you

Hello everyone.
I am new to this forum, but I really felt like I needed some extra help. I've been suffering from major depression and generalized anxiety disorders for 8 years now. I was able to get my symptoms mostly under control with medication and CBT, but recently my depression has come back even stronger. I am finding it very difficult to concentrate on my studies, and I fear it's going to affect my graduation. I am going to see my GP about it this week, but I would also appreciate some additional emotional support.

Hi,
Firstly I'd just like to say that my heart goes out to everyone here suffering from depression and other forms of mental illness, I think it's the toughest (although i have not experienced it to any levels that i imagine others suffer with) and hope i can be in a place to help others in this area one day...
I am concerned I may be starting to get depression at the age of fifty. Firstly I'd like to explain that i have been alone/lonely all my life (physically and mentally), I have very few friends, family/relatives, social-circle; I live alone; I've never had a long-term partner and never lived with a partner. So i have led a VERY, VERY lonely existence all my life. My job just makes enough money to keep me alive, gives me no contact with others. In summary:

I have been alone all my life
I am always living with the fear of homelessness, due to finances (although i have never faced this yet)
I have dealt with my reality fairly well and never suffered serious depression before, although i have felt very lonely and sad at times over the years
I have managed to stay motivated to exercise and live a reasonably healthy (sleep and diet) existence
I have never been content or happy/joyful beyond the odd lucky moments and most of the time I am just ""below average"" at best

Lately I have had days that have been much worse than ever before. I have felt a ""dark cloud"" over everything. I call it a ""dark cloud"" because no matter what i do I get no joy and have no interest. One exception is physical exercise, that does help for a short period (during and after). I enjoy going to bed at night as I DO still enjoy sleeping and appear to still sleep okay, although i wake with the dark cloud. These dark days started a few weeks ago and i am concerned it is the beginning of depression.
 
I know all the ""home remedies"", such as meditation, daily diary, health, joining social groups, taking up hobbies, discussing with a friend, etc. BUT some of these things are either not available to me or simply making no difference.
 I feel like i am ranting and to be honest don't even know why i am writing this or what i am looking for or asking...
 Either way, take care of yourselves everyone

Hey all,
So I'm new to this forum (well I'm new to talking about my mental health in general) a friend of mine suggested beyond blue, so i thought what else do i have to loose? i have struggled with major depression, anxiety (last 2 years bad social anxiety), post traumatic stress, borderline personality disorder and some have said i have bi polar. I was diagnosed when i was 21 with bi polar, then when i had a major mental breakdown at the start of the month i was told i did not have it and was pulled off all my medication. If I'm honest, that in itself was a massive shock to the system, in a strange way those medications became somewhat a part of me... now i am taking absolutely nothing, i was told at the mental health clinic that i attended, since i was young fit healthy with a child and profession behind me that i was basically fine, and there was nothing that they could do for me. Well i was dishearten to say the least, and now I'm just lost and left with my demons. Yes,I have a profession, a child and yes i do exercise 6 days a week. However i am far from ok and i know this deep down inside because i have fought this path for the past 16 years, i have been hospitalised 3 times before due to not being able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I am so tired from this battle, its soul destroying! i have lost so many people form it, people that have tried there hardest to help but were physically drained from giving so much, i lost my job. A job that i loved very much and i haven't worked since i lost my job and that was 3 months ago, it has put much strain on my relationship with my partner (he lost his job in fifo to come and care for me) however i feel so empty towards him, i feel emptiness towards motherhood, just an emptiness towards everything, i can honestly say that i don't find any enjoyment, i only exercise because its the only soul time that i have to concentrate on myself (ect... breathing) i have a sense of anger towards everything and I'm just lost. I am unsure if these feelings come from past unresolved issues which are exacerbating current ones, i do see a therapist which i feel doesn't really help. So basically if you were able to read through all my ramble, i am simply just very lost. I need help to find myself again ...

been feeding the black dog for 5 years now. I have read threads here describing withdrawing from friends, work, life in general. I have done all of these .....not opening mail, paying bills when they come to turn off power, or arrest me. I have just been waiting for everything to implode, but surprisingly, it still hasn't. Now, I am so far behind in all my financial obligations, I don't know how to start getting back on track. 
I am 5 years behind in tax (personal &my business). Paperwork is not computerised, so I don't even know where the invoices, receipts etc are amongst the rubble. A misunderstanding with phone co has resulted in my landline being disconnected on 23/12...I have paid bills (yay direct debit) but I signed up for an NBN/phone package but did not connect it as it does not suit my needs in a remote area. Now sick of begging Indians to reconnect my landline at work, so no bookings.
Fortuitous, as on Boxing Day, I awoke in excruciating pain. CT : slipped disc at C6. Dr. Google says no easy fix, I have read 100s of posts about this, it seems that regardless of treatment route, I will be in pain for the rest of my life. I have accepted this but without work, I can't afford to get specialist referrals etc, (I have paid private health for >16yrs...almost $50k!!! Doesn't cover that??)
1 good thing, This has been my first total 'holiday' from high stress/emotional job in 15yrs.
As a small business owner, I am not able to get sick pay. Centrelink won't pay unless my tax is up to date IF I DID qualify for disability support. I support my 16 yo son (wants transport now he has his learners but no $$) I have never received a cent of child support, his father lives locally and is here daily for meals etc, which I felt was a good thing for my son, but I am angry that I have been supporting him also.
 I know things can't continue like this. But I am scared of making life decisions while in this black hole. I think baby steps are the only way to start to improve our situation (there is much, much more to our story, who wouldn't be depressed??) but it is almost impossible to take even baby steps. I am still putting things on the back burner as a coping strategy to forget problems. Of course they are still there (& worse) the next morning. I KNOW all this but I just can't take a baby step.
Sorry for rambling. (Big sigh, feels bit better tho) 
Is there any free agencies to help sort out financial problems/paperwork?
How have others gotten back on track?

So I suspect we are all different here. Reflecting back I have a cycle of major depression becoming problematic every two to three years. I'm thinking about it because I can feel it again and it is about two years. I'm interested in other experience on this cycle and what works to perhaps turn it around.

Hi y'all, new here. Bit of background - I'm 24 y/o queer and trans and struggling a bit w dysphoria (which comes and goes). So...I've been struggling w depression and anxiety since 14. Since then I've had a severe bout of depression every year without fail. Since being hospitalised for a month when I was 21, I've been doing a lot better.
The last year has been pretty calm - the most calm it's been for me since this all started. I hadn't SI'ed. I've always been a heavy drinker but it wasn't bad. I was doing relatively okay at uni. Had a steady job. 

This year, it all kinda unraveled. My workplace closed down so I lost a source of income. It's my lasts semester at uni and I've yet to go to class and I'm having difficulty with my assignments. I'm also discovering some heavy stuff about myself regarding gender identity. I've also been withdrawing, holing up in my room - it's not uncommon for me to spend a whole week inside. I just feel extremely anxious and uncomfortable in public. The last few weeks or so has seen me crying almost everyday and I SI'ed for the first time in a while yesterday. I'm also having trouble w sleeping and I'm having bad nausea and stomach issues. Essentially all the symptoms I have become familiar w over the past decade. 

Thing is, I feel like I'm faking it all. Which is weird to say...right? I feel like, I'm using depression as a way to justify my failures and shortcomings and laziness and that it's all one big act. And I feel even worse because I'm such a loser that I would try to deceive myself of having a mental illness when I'm actually perfectly fine. And then I'd question myself and my intentions and I'd get all confused and mixed up. 

But then I'd have absolutely horrible days when I know something's wrong, but it's not as serious as how I remembered my bouts of depression used to be, so it's just me making a big deal out of nothing, right? 

I hesitate to go see a therapist or whatever because even if I am actually relapsing, it's never done anything for me (over 7 years, I've jumped from one person to another to another and so on). I just feel really disgusted with myself. Just looking for some thoughts on the matter. I would like to know if I am just running away from my problems or if there is actually something wrong. I just feel very fake and I think that I've managed to psyche myself into a lie and that everything I'm feeling and thinking is just one big act for myself.
Thanks in advance.  -Umeboshi.

Hi people !,
I've been diagnosed with depression for atleast the last few years now. This last year i've been managing with a few ups and downs but getting there.
What im currently still having trouble   with is keeping myself interested and motivated to do things...its really strange because i'll be really obsessed with a new idea or hobby I'd want to persue and think about it excessively for atleast a week...then slowly loose interest again before ive even tried. I seem to do the same  thing when meeting new guys. I'll be interested in them for a little while then id automatically loose interest after about a week...could this be insecurity or maybe something deeper than that?. 
If anyones been through the same thing i'd love some tips to get myself out of this cycle. Feel like ill be waisting even more of my life if I dont 😔

So I posted on here about a year ago getting some advise about telling my partner that I have depression. 
I did manage to write it all down in a letter to him explaining how I feel. We briefly spoke about it after he read it and that was it. I dont think he understands but he tried to remain supportive. He has definitely help me sometimes in my angry outburst by recognising the situation and not adding it. Unfortunately this is not always the case. 
So since then I saw a councillor for about 10 sessions. It was good to talk but I still could never get everything out. I still always hold back something which I guess it out of fear of being judged. I haven't seen her in a few months and know I should go back but just seems like a waste of time.
I also lost my step dad last August which has turn my life upside down. He was in my heart my true dad as he was there since I was 4yrs old. I always felt like I would be ok dealing with depression coz he was always a phone call away and I would turn to him if needed. But now he's gone and I can't cope with that reality. 
I have been going from job to job trying it make something right in my life and just can't do it. I just want to run away. 
The last few days have been really bad and I just can't shake off....

Hi Beyond Blue members,
I'm having a bit of a crisis. I am feeling very anxious at work and get the feeling my boss is trying to get me to quit. It is a small business where he and his wife pretty much run everything and I am (or was) the next level of responsibility. Recently while I was away on annual leave, my bosses wife was filling in for some of my duties. She logged in to my work email account and changed my title in my email signature from Admin manager to Admin assistant. At the moment they have let my contract lapse (it expired in January and they haven't renewed it yet). My boss asks me to do things I am not comfortable with (eg lying) and sets me tasks I cannot complete (eg I do not have access to some files and he knows this). 
I want to quit and get back into my passion (teaching) but it has been over a year since I was in a classroom and have lost all my confidence, and looking for work really causes problems with my depression. If I quit before I find a new job I will be unemployed and I know my depression will spiral out of control. I should stay for financial reasons but I don't know how much longer I can take being treated this way. I am expected to know everything and do everything and be responsible for everything, but for the wage I'm getting (less than if I were teaching) I really don't feel it is worth it at all. 
I feel terrible, I am frightened and just want to go home and stay in bed forever. I don't want to feel this way.
Any advice? 
Thanks guys xo

I used to be in control. Have my life together. The one that people came to as I could figure their issues out and help. The rock my family could depend on. 
Now I'm a mess. I'm bipolar ii, I'm medicated, I see a psych. I've stabilises over the last 6 months. 
As soon as something happens, it sends me spiralling off. 
My mum is really sick, probably won't make it and I can't cope at all. I used to be the strong one supporting family, in times like these, now I am useless, falling apart. 
I feel guilty the last 6 months I couldn't talk to my mum. We didn't have a common understanding and I couldn't be honest with what I was going through so I shut her out. Now I regret it. 
I don't think I will ever go back to the old me. The strong independent woman I was. 
This illness has ruined my life forever. 
 Who can honestly say they are the same person as before they were diagnosed? Yes you might have pieced most of your life back together, gone back to work, exercising and eating well. 
 But are you really the same you? Or a broken version of yourself slapped together so you can function just good enough to make a contribution to society?

Hello everyone im new to this forum and just wanting a little help and advise.
 I just wanted to say thankyou for reading this to anyone that has been in the same situation as my self.
Through out my life i have suffered from depression and anxiety but after a recent operation things took a turn for the worst. Im a 25 year old male who has recently gone through three operations in the last six months however my last operation on the 11th of April 2017 things took a turn for the worst. I was having a Septoplasty due to not being able to breath through my nose , i was a little worried going in but nothing to out of the blue. The procedure seemed to go well however as soon as i woke up from my general anesthetic i woke up with massive panic attacks and a week later im not feeling any better. These panic attacks hit me with out no warning they hit me when im trying to sleep, I have and over whelming feeling of worrie and panic that i just cant shake. I have cried for the first time in 10 years i feel like an absolute mess.
i dont know if its the drugs that was used to put me to sleep ?
I dont know if post operative anxiety is a thing i just dont know
i just want some advise and someone to talk to 
Thankyou for reading

I made a post a while ago and have an update.
As of now, I have seen:

5 Psychologists
3 Psychiatrists (Not including 3 seen in ED on seperate occasions)
3 GPs

I have attended an estimated 80+ sessions with the aboveI have unsuccessfully used

2 SSRIs
1 NaSSA


1 SNRI
1 atypical 

Well, not much is better. Does anyone know what I should do from here? I will continue psychological treatment but are there any other treatments available? Combinations? TCS?
Not specific advice necessarily, but if anyone has gone down this route and has come out. That would be good to hear about.

I feel the need to move state to seek the help I desperately need because I can't see my life getting any better where I am and I'm close to the edge as it is.... plus the added pressures of so called ""family and friends"" that don't really care and know how to push all the wrong buttons to make me feel like a worthless piece of shit.....
I have no support at all I only have ME to help MYSELF but with my anxiety taking over lately that's extremely hard on the best of days.... so I'm just hoping someone can give me some advice or even just let me know if this is even possible

The Plate 


Imagine a plate dropping on the floor.
Its broken but the pieces are easy to fit back together with some glue
The same plate is dropped again, not only the glued pieces ..now there are smaller pieces  and this time it takes longer after picking up each piece…fitting it back into place.
Not long after the plater is dropped again. There are a lot more pieces…even smaller than before..some pieces need to be thrown away, some are chipped. After a long and tiring process the plate is put back …well kind of. It will never look or feel the same it now has rough edges and pieces missing. 
Again not long after this, yep you guessed it the plate is dropped.
The floor is covered in hundreds of pieces. Is it worth picking up and putting together?
It is decided..yep..it can be fixed. It takes over one month but with lots of glue and some paint the plate seems to be restored …It will just need to be handled with a lot more care and definitely not dropped again.
Not even 1 full year goes by when the plate is taken away to a different house. It is continuously dropped on the floor but surprisingly the plate does not break. The glue and paint have worked …so you think.
The plate remains unused until the next year where it is being used for an important event, there are doubts about its use…judgements from other people even; they advise that the plate is not good enough and cannot do the job. The plate is used despite the doubt and lack of confidence.
Not long after the party has began pieces of glass are found on the table..on the floor..pieces from the plate….it was not dropped this time it fell apart on its own slowly but surely before the end of the night millions of pieces of the plate lay scattered on the floor all over the place.. This time there is no hope of putting it back together, even if attempted. 
90% is thrown away…the other 10% a small, rough piece is kept for some reason. It is not useful at all. When some pick it up out of curiosity they are cut and hurt by it. Others avoid it completely or try to throw it away.
 The piece of the plate is now dangerous. It now has the capacity to kill a person so it is monitored to ensure nobody is hurt…
There is talk of the piece being fixed..made in to something else…But it doesn’t fit anywhere it is useless. What would you do?

I can't cope any more. I've had severe depression for over 2.5 years and tried everything. Nothing works. I don't know how I can keep going like this.

Hi all.
So I have been reading up on things and taking in other posts. It seems like a warm and embracing community on here.
I've been on my new meds for depression for almost 3 months. I am still strugglung with dark thoughts and finding balance. It's been a long time unmedicated so i guess it's takibg time to find my way. I really need the meds....noticing the difference in me if I forget a day's dose.
I've found the last 2 weeks particularly hard as work has been quiet so my routine has been a little different. I've loved the time to myself but now at night i struggle with restlessness and I feel very lonely. I have 4 kids, a noisy house but i am still lonely. I also have a great husband.
Does anyone else deal with this kind of thing? I'm open to suggestions.
Thank you.
Caitie

Every day is a struggle atm, I am still taking my meds, going to work and putting on a brave face. I can't tell my family what is really going on inside my head and my body but I really feel like I'm slowly drowning and I don't know how much more I can take. I don't want my kids to see me failing again. 
I have made an appointment with my GP but I cant see her until the end of May. I m not sure if I should increase my meds myself of try to battle on until I see her.
I wish it would just all go away!

Hi 
Having a hard day today, feeling very depressed and low really low.
Nothing I can think of has triggered my mood, I just woke up thismorning in a state of depression and haven't been able to pull myself up. Its  alot easier said than done. Im also feeling anxious.
My mind is at war with itself, everything seems muffled. I also feel very confused, my thoughts are all over the place. Its as if everythings moving along and Im just watching.
Ive been doing my mindfullness and my controlled breathing, its better than nothing. My Doctors seem happy with me at the moment, shame Im not happy with myself. I also keep a daily journal which I find very helpful.
Anyway I just needed to vent, thanx BB 
Annie

How, how do I do that... a boss who says he's trying to be understanding, then sends me an email while I'm on a approved leave day telling me he wants a meeting with me tomorrow because he must take disciplinary action. I have always tried to keep him in the loop, maybe it's easier just to get a doctors certificate and tell them nothing... I try and do the right thing then get crucified... I'm getting closer to the edge 😢

Hello,

I suffer from galactosemia and it does come with mental illness too. my crappy disability.

I got diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2011 when I was very sick and I lost my paying part time job then.

I feel socially isolated from people and I spend most of my time smoking cigarettes out of depression and boredom.

I feel depressed and lost with other people. I am suffering mental pain from my crappy medical issues



I feel like I have no friends. I am taking monthly medication for schizo from my doctor.  injections

there is no fun in my life anymore for me. everything is a chore and it
is really hard for me. I am getting more introverted the older that I
get, spending time alone

So I have been stuck in this awful rut lately of being constantly down. I have to force myself to smile at work and around other people so no one thinks anything is wrong, but its so exhausting. Last night was the worst I've been in a very long time, I'm having troubles with my relationship because of my constant mood swings and I feel like no matter how much I try to explain how I feel, no one understands. I've been called crazy before and that sentence is stuck in my head. I feel like a constant dispointment and a burden on everyone. Is this normal? I try and question my thoughts but when I do I hear the words you're stupid and why bother. I don't know how to stop feeling this way. Can anyone offer a suggestion?

Hi there I'm new here. First of all, thanks a lot if you're reading this. I just need some advice cause I feel like no one around me really understands me.
 I have been really confused and lost with my mental health. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 3 years ago and taking antidepressants. My depression got better but my mood is always changing. I would be really interested in certain things and get really into it. And all of a sudden, I got bored. My favourite food/colour etc also changes frequently. I think these have been going on since I was a kid but recently it gets more intense. I would become very close to someone and suddenly I could get angry to them for no reasons. I do impulsive things like spending a lot, gambling, drinking etc. Never had a stable relationship until the current one who really cares me and fixes my stupid mistakes for over a year. Before the longest one was 3 months, always broke up because of small things. 
I am 25, male, homosexual. My mind is always full of thoughts and sometimes I feel really tired and just want to sleep. I thought I might be bipolar and saw a psychiatrist 2 months ago. Despite having to make a booking for months in advance, he finished the session after 15 minutes. He said I am bipolar, increased the does of my antidepressant and prescribed me a mood stablizer. It made me feel so slow and my mind became very heavy and uncomfortable. I could not think properly and I got more confused in my thoughts. So I stopped taking them. I saw him again 2 weeks ago and he prescribed me with another one, ended my session in less than 5 minutes. I do not want to spend another $400 on a session as I don't have medicare. 
I did researches online about my symptoms and I can be having borderline personality disorder or ADHD. But I don't know. Can a GP or a psychologist diagnose these disorders? Where else can I get help as I can't afford a psychiatrist? And any advice what to tell the doctor when I meet them? I usually feel so anxious and talk a lot without thinking what I am talking about. Only after leaving the doctor, I will remember what I should have said. 
 Thanks again if you're still reading. I really need some advice cause I have been confused for so long.

I have suffered from depression for most of my life, however most of my family and friends do not know.  I grew up in an era where you didn't talk about mental illness, hence most of my problems were not diagnosed nor addressed for over 50 years (I am 62). 
It wasn't until I had a breakdown about 6 years ago and was finally diagnosed when I cried through a doctor's appointment.  I was put on a low dosage medication, which definitely helped and since that time the dosage has been increased once.  
Obviously there is a lot more to my life story, but I'll save that for other threads.  My concern is that I don't know how to talk to people.  The only people who know I suffer from depression are my husband, my sister-in-law and two friends (who do not live close to me, nor do I have much contact with).  I have three grown-up children, all married with their own children.  They do not know.  None of my other small circle of friends know either.
I have recently decided that I need to actively help myself, but it is very difficult to get motivated.  I have started doing some meditation, and also tell myself that I need to get out and walk, but this is difficult to achieve when it's pretty bad weather out there!
Do I need to tell my children?  Should they be aware of the struggles I've had, or should I just carry on without them being aware?  And if I tell them, how do I do so?

Today, I got home from shopping with my Mum and I sat down on my couch and started crying. I don't know why I was crying. But I felt really sad. And for the past few weeks, I have had this overwhelming feeling of sadness following me around, even though I know deep down I have nothing to be sad about. 
 I was walking around the shopping centre and I felt exhausted. My eyes felt heavy, like I had either over slept or under slept. I guess you could call it groggy. I just didn't feel myself. And I don't feel like myself writing this. I am normally a pretty upbeat, funny, social kind of guy, but lately I feel like it's been all an act - like I am keeping up a persona in front of other people in order not to show my true self.
Like everyone, I have a long history - mostly things I don't want to write on an online forum, but needless to say, some of it was pretty heavy and hard to deal with too the point I feel like I haven't actually dealt with or processed some of it at all. Or maybe I am just making excuses for myself again. I am really good at that, apparently.
I know there are far worse things happening to people across the planet, my problems pale in comparison. And to be honest, I don't even know if they are problems or not. I guess I am just really confused. Why would I just start crying? Why do I feel so tired all the time? Why do I feel so anxious when I go to a nightclub with my friends? Are they my friends? Do they even like me? Sometimes I feel like they do, and other times I feel like a third, fourth, fifth wheel. Like I am physically there, but I am not really present in their eyes.
I guess I just needed to put how I am feeling into words, and thought the best place to do that would be a website like this one. I don't really know what I am expecting to get out of this post, but it is about time I started vocalising how I've been feeling because I feel like I've been bottling some things up for a while now and I don't know what I am supposed to do about it.

I am so tired, physically & mentally...but I have to keep going. I am the person everyone turns to, and I am the positive person, but I hardly ever open up and tell anyone how I really feel. I can't tell anyone what is wrong with me...I'm having my mental health used against me in a family court matter...as far as anyone else knows now I'm fine. I get asked how are you my answer is I'm fine...but I'm not. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety & ptsd a few years ago...but I've been working so hard for years on it that...I'm fine. They can't see the pain that is inside my head. I'm not suicidal, simply because I can't be...too many people rely on me.
I feel so alone. Sometimes I write to get the feelings out, this is what I wrote half an hour ago before I thought to have a look on BB.
I am lonely. There is not one person in this town that has initiated a conversation or friendship with me. I'm not ugly, I'm not scarey, I can't understand it...except that it is ""this town"". Depression is so ugly in this town, so ugly that even our local council members have committed suicide. I have 5 ""acquaintances"" in this town, but none I can turn to about how I feel right now. I was moved away from my support network by the person who is taking me to court about our child.
I'm the one who initiates conversation. I'm the one who tries to make a connection. Right now I could not be bothered as it has become too hard to keep trying. I've lived in this town for 4 and a half years. I was happier in the city and I am when I visit there but I'm tied to this town at the moment because of the court case. I now have to represent myself...I hear myself saying this all the time ""I am not a lawyer"". I can't do this and I keep making mistakes with it but there's nothing else I can do except do it. Yes I've approached services for help with it, but they can only give advice, they can't actually help.
I am tired and there is no one who can actually help right now...I just have to keep going. I feel like a windger that's why I put this here instead of my personal facebook wall.

Hello
This is my first post. I'm in my mid-thirties and have dealt with depression and (what I now am beginning to recognise as) anxiety on and off since I started university. In retrospect it really hit when I started drinking alcohol. Or rather, dived into a vat of it. I come from a conservative, quite religious background and I'd never had a drop of alcohol before going to a college on campus at the age of 17. Residential colleges can host a pretty dangerous alcohol culture, even to souls that are tougher than mine. Alcohol and cigarettes became inextricably allied with freedom and a world to which I'd always aspired. Ooh yes, I was all in. And I've been trapped in a Master-Servant relationship with both of them ever since.
Basically the twin cessna engines of alcohol and cigarettes don't power me like (most) other people in my social circle.Our childhoods don't define us but I think we are all trying to find a riposte to them in some way. I was taught to doubt myself, to always feel guilt, to come second or even last and be gracious about it. Don't expect too much. Settle. I was shouted at and verbally abused for the smallest infringement by a father who has a lot of stuff going on mentally. It feels good to say he verbally abused me because I'm not allowed to say that in real life. Because it would hurt him too much. ""Look at how much he loves you"", ""that generation is different."" Of course he loves me. Almost too much sometimes. It is a smothering love. Telling a child how much you love them after you've just called them atrocious names, told them that they were worthless, yelled at them for nothing or kicked them out of the car and made them walk because they disagreed with you might just possibly leave that child with a poor sense of self worth as an adult. Then he'd be lovely. Very confusing, really. 
Anyway, there's been a lot of light and a lot of darkness. Maybe that's life. But I look around me and I see my friends buying houses and having children and I see me hanging back, afraid. Drinking too much still, trying to survive the dangerous depression that ensues. And I don't want to be afraid anymore. I don't want to just survive. I don't want to look to everyone else for approval, I don't want to be scared to speak my mind. I know what I believe, I want to find the courage to live it. I don't want to just survive, I want to thrive.
I want us ALL to thrive. I'm writing this because I had to tell SOMEONE. Thanks for listening. :)

Hmm where to begin...I had some health issues growing up, I missed some school and I got teased a lot because it was hard to hide (though I was cured at 13) - my first year of high school was going ok, near the end I was bullied again and was socially ostracised, had a meltdown and left school. The first fatal mistake.
I lived (and still do, for the most part) in a semi rural area. I had no access to public transport for most of my life, I missed my 'work experience' years. No one will higher someone as old as me (26) without experience in anything. I've never gotten my licence (learners expired) and don't see how I'd ever own a car.
I still live with my parents and I don't see how that could ever change. I don't know what I'm going to do a decade from now because I don't want to be dependant forever.

3 years ago I did a diploma and started doing some freelance work from home, I make pocket change. My parents are constantly broke and I've never been able to save. I was on the dole for about 2 years and I was using that money to get out more, study, pay for driving lessons and get my life moving, now that's gone. As soon the required work for the dole started I shut down. The only thing I was offered was slave labor at an OP shop. I couldn't walk after 1 day of moving furniture/cleaning/on foot deliveries on my feet 6 hours straight, didn't want to deal with public transport in general [I even have anxiety just going somewhere by myself], so I gave up. Now I live on about $100 a week, and that's the past 3 years of my life. I'm mostly an introvert, I can't sell myself, I hate freelancing. I've really only kept steady work from some small agencies as a contractor so I didn't have to talk to anyone except my employer.

What I did learn is you need to be able to relate to people to get laughs, and I don't. Improv requires a good imagination, something I didn't know I was missing until I took the class.

I really  thought joining an on line forum would help but feel more isolated and depressed reading others stories. The words of wisdom are  great, most of us know what we should be doing: talking to some one, seeking medical help,  going for walk or just getting some sunshine and fresh air. But when you have lost every thing: relationships, friends, employment because of your depression nothing makes sense any more. Nothing brings joy or happiness or some  relief.  So back l go under my doona, counting the days until l start TMS therapy then worrying myself sick that it won't work and this will be  as good as it gets 😕 J

I should prob note, even though the thought has crossed my mind - I have no actual plans in place and don't intend to hurt myself.  I just noted it to highlight how bad I've been feeling.  I just want anyone to point me in a direction of help seeing as though the GPs have turned me away twice now after requesting an updated mental health plan and I'm not getting better with time.

I live in a country town in Victoria, so options are automatically limited.
I have seen 3 GPs, 2 psychologists, 1 counsellor, 1 mental health care nurse, tried meds, etc.
I am at my wits end. Firstly nothing.... nothing, relieves my symptoms. 
The first psych gave me the ""google-list"" of self-help (exercise, diet, music, gratitude lists, hobbies, etc) and that I was being dismissive, even though I had been doing all that stuff. Then I saw the counsellor, who straight up told me he couldn't help. My current psych is making no headroad with me at all and said so herself that she was running out of ideas.
My GP suggested trying meds again, which I was reluctant about. I keep hearing you need to try different medication, so I made myself open to the idea. A liver function test showed issues (despite not being a heavy drinker, taking nothing else, and living a clean life), so he won't prescribe one type of meds and says another type won't help me. He is focussed on the next option being a psychiatrist two hours away. I did some research, and saw a different GP to get a referral to a visiting psychiatrist (again, not keen, but I'm trying to stay open minded). New GP said that psychologist was rubbish, meds are rubbish, and to ""try being more positive"" and had I ""heard about homeopathy"".
I am done with this. It is plastered everywhere that help is available, but my experience over the last couple of years says that unless you are a bored housewife or have a lust for material things and need to come to terms with this stuff then it goes in the ""too hard"" basket. The basket where I live. There is no real help available. I've spoken with phone counsellors here and on LifeLine, and they are in a difficult position and ultimately cannot do anything. Ultimately, I am convinced that there is no help available.
If you've made it this far, thanks. If you've been in a similar situation and found a way to access meaningful help please let me know what you did, because I am ready to give up.

Hello
I just need some help. I've been feeling upset lonely jealous nasty all the time at late. 
I have reasons to feel like this as I'm always the nice person. Counselling hasn't helped I've tried numerous times  My marriage is in tatters and I've got rid of many so called nasty influences out of my life . I'm the one most people unload on but when I need someone no one is ever there for me.
I feel though I'm never ever happy. Is this depression? I'm not sure and when I sit and think ok what's going to make me happy I go blank  
please help I feel desperate and my feelings are getting worse

I feel that I have a ""can't live with em, can't live without em"" mindset concerning alcohol and drugs that has severely impacted my mental health. I'm not a hard drug user or anything like that, but upon coming down today from a night of mdma use, in which I made a complete fool of myself at a club and lost my phone/wallet I've realised just how bad my depression is. I've had it for a very long time, but somehow I just never thought of myself as being ""depressed"". I know that I won't feel this way forever and that eventually my seratonin levels will be back to normal, but it begs the question to me: what next? I fear that I lack the confidence necessary to make the colossal changes needed to get my life back on track, and I'm disturbed by how totally I've managed to block out any self reflection on the creeping depression and anxiety that's followed me throughout all of my life. I've registered an account on this site on a whim, and I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who can relate to this? Anyone care to share their experiences or thoughts?

In the past 18 months I've come to realize that I am simply irrelevant and powerless in the greater scheme of life. I have no legal rights because at the time I couldn't afford to see a Psychiatrist or Psychologist and I am irrelevant, apparently nothing is taken serious unless these professionals say it. 
At the moment, I've had a change of thought and actually enrolled in the Diploma of Mental Health, I can be an outreach worker and help others who struggle with mental health problems. I'm also going to get my MR licence so I can get some casual driving work, hopefully.
A bit part of the problem is money and power, although my finances are getting better and I have a plan in place to get my finances moving in the right direction, what on earth do I need to do to be relevant? I can't do a Medical Degree, obviously. I wont be of much influence with as a bus driver and/or mental health outreach worker. hmmm

 Hi all,
I am looking for advice from those who have recovered or are recovering from depression on how to cope when you feel the ""pangs"" of depression slowly come back.
I had severe depression and anxiety for over a year, together with other health issues.
With the right help - GP, therapy, self-care, I've gotten over the worst bits of it. Things are on the up, it seems. 
But a few days ago - IT came back. It was slow, like a python slowly swallowing up its prey after strangling it. I've tried my usual coping mechanisms...but it's getting worse. I feel like I'm slowly sinking and I don't want to go back there.
I don't want to risk my job, health and mental health again. I've already binged for 3 days straight. Didn't go to work because I just...felt...so low. I changed all my appointments to see my therapist to the next week simply because I couldn't deal with meeting people. I increasingly notice I am slipping into obsessing over terrible things that at the height (or low) of my depression made me abuse myself mercilessly mentally and physically every minute/hour/day/week.
As someone who's so far recovered and has never been in this position...how do I deal with this? I want to keep feeling.

I don't know if anyone has heard of the term loveshyness I'm not sure if it is formally recognised but I am a sufferer I am 41 and have never been on a date let a lone had a girlfriend they always reject me or put me in the creep zone, my last incident got me banned from a major gym. I believe this is partly linked to my depression. I stared seeing another doctor for convenience of appointments I was very tired all the time and he sai it was due to the depression, he sent me to a psychiatrist who diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. I've tried heaps of medications, and just the last few times this doctor started getting into me about getting a girlfriend and that will fix all my problems I tried to explain the problems I have and he was giving me anxiety attacks he was doing more harm than good. I have since gone back to my old doctor

Hi guys
uhh so im in abit of a situation atm

so im on another forums- not going to say which one but its a social forum for people with MI as well. Ive been told by 2 people on the forum and a 3 friends which I thought was a friend off the forum tell me that im really annoying and that they are sick of validating my feelings. 

Firstly I had no idea I was doing that, considering most peoples stories and comments etc on where I am want you to also validate their feelings but they havent been plled up about it. I feel very targeted as im the youngest member on there. 

I feel really uncomfortable now and like I have to limit what I say, where I say it, how I say it and that I can no longer express my feelings openly.


Secondly- how do I stop doing it

Ok, first of all, I thank you for taking the time to read this.

I've had i anxiety and depression since I was as young as 15, but now that I am 26 it has hit me the hardest in my life.
Although mental health issues always loomed in the background, I managed to get a degree, held a part time job for 4 years and had an active social life. I moved to a new city in 2016 as I wanted the change. I worked in a new job for 8 months but was not able to meet the targets of the job (KPIs)  and it got to the point that my doctor had to sign me off of work due to a mental health decline.

I felt like a total failure and spent 2 months of hell, unable to get out of bed, eat, shower and care for myself but I was lucky to find a fantastic psychiatrist who helped me get back on my feet. After two months of recovery, I landed a job in a large company and I finally felt this amazing turning point in my life & that all the darkness was finally over.

After 2 months into the job, I was commended for my professionalism and work ethic. However, one week later (last week) I was pulled aside and told that I have 1 month to show performance improvements, or they'll make the 'executive decision' to terminate my employment. Apparently I made too many small mistakes and they are concerned that if I continue, that it would be a cost to the business. I was devastated as I had put my heart and soul into it and  deferred my master's degree so I could focus on settling into the job. Today the pressure was so overwhelming and I was making many silly mistakes and it was at this moment  I decided to resign as I had realised that I was not capable of working under these conditions. 

 I have set up many plans to ensure I am safe and have the best support possible, but I am feeling so scared about the future. I am so concerned that I am getting older and my mental health issues are just robbing so many important years of my youth. What's more, I can't stop worrying that I am too incompetent to survive in the workplace, that I wont be able to find a workplace that is a good fit for me and that the gap in my resume (7 months so far and counting) as well as the short, 8 month stint in my last job will make recruiters reluctant to hire me.

Has anyone been in a similar position and managed to come out of it the other side?

So I notice lately that every week I seem to hit a massive downer on one day and I'll sleep for 15 hours! 
I'm a uni student and yesterday I had an incident at a hostel I'd wanted to stay at and I bluntly told them their hostel was overpriced crap, they didn't even have soap and I was surprised they had toilet paper! I was told I didn't need to be rude, well I asked nicely last week and was brushed off twice. 
I came home and was so depressed I slept 15 hours and missed classes today. 

I'm frustrated at how strong my meds are yet weekly this happens and I'm so down. 
Should I go tell my Psychiatrist? I'm not meant to see him for 3 weeks. He frustrates me because he doesn't say anything unless I ask a direct question. 

Advice please.

It's been a few years since I've posted on here, mainly cos I've self-managed my depression and anxiety issues, but I still have some issues that I still need to work on. One is having a go at people on Facebook or email randomly when I have a bad day. I tend do it when I feel disconnected and I feel a person isn't communicating with me and I don't see them much or if I have a problem with their life. One example was the other day where I had a go a girl who said I was too nice and too sweet a couple of months ago when we were sparring in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), it bothered me on and off for a couple of months. I was feeling pretty ordinary the other day (too much exercise I reckon, I go pretty hard at MMA and BJJ) and I finally had a go at her by asking ""Too nice and sweet huh? I'm not as nice as you think."" She didn't respond by her friend deleted the comment cos he didn't want an argument to start and he said he was pretty disappointed in my actions and that she was one of his best mates. I told him yeah I didn't like it when  people said I'm too nice and thought she was criticising me personally. After a few back and forth exchanges, I finally told him that I probably shouldn't have done it and that I didn't know her from a bar of soap. I suppose I didn't like it when people said I'm too nice because when I was training at a another gym a couple of years ago, one of the instructors said I was too nice and that it was holding me back and told me to go 100% (but this bloke was a twit to be fair) and I didn't like what he said. Anyway, I'm generally pretty laidback 95% of the time and people describe me as pretty easygoing but it's just that 5% where I feel really low and isolated. I tend to drop people from social media who don't really communicate with me and I've attacked people in the past when I'm in my 5% moods where I felt like I wasn't being treated fairly.

I am walking bad luck. Nothing good happens in my world. I work a crappy part time job that abuses my hard working ethic while everyone demands to know when I'll get a ""real job"". I have no friends left where I live. My partner is very sick so we cannot do as much together as we use to - we were trying to be more active. I have no life prospects. I cannot find a line of work that captivates my enthusiasm. I'm so bitter about the world I see nothing in it but endless crap.
I have fought my whole life to gain half a step, I'm sick of working so hard for nothing. I'm going nowhere! I'm trying so hard to claw out of this pit. I stay up til early hours everyday trying to make something of my miserable self. I cry myself to sleep - I'm so stressed. I'm panicked, I'm worthless unremarkable.
I hate myself for being such a failure. I'm lost, I don't know what  to do or where to go with my life. I'm scared. I'm tired, and burnt out.
I'm desperate to make changes but I'm unmotivated or faced with my stupid empty head. I'm all over the place. I feel thinly spread. I really need some guidance from people that have been here - talking to a GP won't help, I'm very rational but very stressed and blue and angry. 
I'm not even sure if this depression I feel - I could be completely spastic and wasting your time. I apologise.:/

Hi so my new dr has suggested I do this- I wanted to share it with BB people because my mood swings/depression/anxiety are really affecting my relationships with those around. I share it because it may just help others.
i hope it does!
 
day one 2nd April 2017.
Wow what a day! I went from being absolutely miserable, to hyper (my super-happy-not-on-drugs-high), to feeling like I was in the darkest pit of no return in the space of 3 hours but it was my dad who would have normally put me down and told me I'm ""stupid""  who actually got me out of my little pit of doom.
 for the first time, he sat with me and we had an honest talk about a kind of future we'd both like in each of our lives and he helped me map out a budget. He saw me hurting myself over past mistakes and found a way gentler to turn those around - without anger or out downs or yelling, swearing, demanding or questioning, just a simple ""here to help for a future"" manner which I loved!
weve never done that before. He's always just lectured or yelled at me until I switch off, walk away or forget any promises to him and end up doing the opposite, running away and spending all my money on bad sugary food to make myself feel a little better usually.
dad was just patient and understanding. I think he finally gets me, my behaviour. I think I finally get him too. 
Its nice. 
Mum and dad both thanked me too for finally getting around to cleaning a few things today and cooking a meal last night. It was good to feel free to contribute again. I want to do that more and be more healthy, wholesome...yeh ghads, I'm becoming domestic agh lol  but I'm liking it. Not feeling too moody/mood-swinging, feeling somewhat satisfied.  And loved...and thankful to two members on here (White Knight and Croix bless you both)
Hope that feeling stays and everyone here has a good night too!!
youve got a (slightly sideways) friend in me 
bed time! Niight!

Hi, 
Just thought I would ask if anyone has experienced a sense that something is missing.  Like a part of you.  You are not complete?Or you don't feel connected to your family  (Or close to others).   I feel this huge emptiness, that seems to only be filled with sadness.   I
am crying all the time, for no real reason.  (Apart from my diagnosis,  Major Depression, Anxiety, Panic) 

I grew up in the Catholic Church, moved to Pentecostal, but lost my faith years ago. (I really believed in God when I was a child) In fact, our family lived in a old nunnery at one point.  Right next door to the church.  I was an alter boy.  See that proves, I'm worthy :)

But this emptiness.   It feels like somehow I am disconnected with the universe (or other people)  (If that's possible)  But again, it brings with it sadness. (If I let it, and I do, because it feels right) ???  With that comes searching. You sense something is not quite right then ask ""what's missing"".
Something is missing. 

Appreciate any thoughts.
 Thanks

Hi, I'm new to this thing but I really need somewhere to vent, I just want to know that I'm not alone in feeling this way.
 Im 22 years old, I'm a girl and My whole life I've just felt like a failure, a nobody. I never knuckled down and concentrated properly in school because I hated being there. I felt as though nobody really liked me, like I was constantly being made fun of behind my back. I worried about my appearance and wether I'd be bullied about my big nose, my goofy teeth or if my voice sounded weird. I look at my younger sister who is so beautiful, confident and smart and I can't help but feel like such a failure. I have never been outgoing or confident and it effects how I now perform at my job, how I am with my friends, I just feel so dumb and scared of people all the time. Sometimes I go out of my way to avoid people, I always cancel on plans last minute because I freak out and overthink things. I can't even talk to strangers without mixing up my words or getting red faced and clammy.
I look at myself in the mirror and I cannot stand what I see. I feel as though everyone around me are doing great things with their lives and I'm just stuck in this deep pit with no way out. I do not like who I've become and it makes me feel so low that I have come this far and not gotten any better. I feel as though no matter how hard I try to fix myself, I'll never feel good enough. 
I don't know what to do anymore, I wish I could change.

Hi there,I feel likethere is  no hope for me to treat my depression. I've been on countless Anti-Depressants for the last few years but they only last for a few months & I have to go back to my Psychiatrist and increase the dosage or change to another type. This was not only emotionally draining but also financially as it costs around $250 each time I see my Psychiatrist. Thankfully my Mum helped me out on several occasions to pay the fees coz I can't afford it on my own.This cycle was going on for a couple of years but I would continue to get bad bouts of depression at least once a month. I suggested to my Psychiatrist that I might have Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) which is a condition where a woman has severe depression symptoms, irritability, and tension before menstruation so we tried medication for that also but again it didn't work. I was also taking something to help me sleep which lasted about a year but then it stopped. I wouldn't sleep for days and I would be absolutely exhausted at work. I'd go through my day like a zombie. I got so desperate, I resorted to over the counter sleeping pills to help me sleep but again, they didn't really work. In May this year, I went to Peru to try an extreme form of alternative therapy. This was my last resort to get help and during the 2 weeks I was there and for about a month after, I felt amazing. I really felt like something had shifted in me and I was happy, energetic and enthusiastic about life again.Now this feeling of elation has worn off and I am right back to where I was before, feeling depressed, crying all the time, no motivation or energy to do anything and not wanting to socialise with people. I'm also not sleeping again. I haven't been on any medication for just over 11 weeks but I don't want to go back on Anti-Depressants again & start that cycle all over again.I've seen 3 Psychologists which was helpful at the time but as soon as my 10 sessions were over, it's like I forgot everything I had learned or something.I know I need help but I don't know what else to try? I don't want it to get to the stage where I am attempting suicide again, which I've tried three times, 2 earlier this year. I have my Mum to talk to but she can't really offer any advice & I don't have any friends, I pushed them all away & I don't want to burden anyone. I just ended a friendship with my ex coz I don't want to put him through more crap  Please help I' m desperate....

I feel so negative and I feel as though I'm such a waste of a life just spreading negativity aroudn to everyone around me. 
I just need somewhere to vent, so sorry if im bringing anyone down too... I'm feeling so worthless..hopeless... does anyone feel that way? It seems like everyone around me has their life together and I've been left behind.
My parents always confirm their regrets for having me. It hurts ofcourse, but I agree with them. Sometimes I wish i weren't born so i didn't have to make them so miserable. I wish I could just vanish into thin air.
The only person I seemed to connect with for a while was my sister, but all of a sudden she's turned her back on me. It feels cold. I feel do lonely. Im connected to do many people on facebook but why do I feel this way. I would consider myself 'normal' in frontof my friends but it just feels so tiring. 
I'm rambling. My thoughts are a mess. I'm sure this made no sense. Sorry if you've read through it all.  I've just wasted so much of your precious time. Sorry. I just needed someone or something to talk to.

I've been Writing for days but just can't press post.  Maybe this time?  So hard to share this.  The find it hard to talk about.
just so tired of everything and it seems I'm spending a lot of time fighting to keep going but, you know, now I'm tired.  I can't cope with it like this.  I'm worn out.  I worry I'm getting weaker.  I usually walk sometimes an hour or more when I'm getting bad, 2 or 3 times a day some days, to try and get away from house.  That helps sometimes.  Not tonight.
  I'm in a dark room shaking, crying just feeling pressure from everything.  I can't tell my family I'm not I'm just shaking more at the thought.  I go to my doc with serious health problems but can't get the courage to tell him about this.  Sit there with my phone and numbers but just can't ring.  I know I need help I know I do but I don't know why i can't ask.  how do I ask for help?  I know who but can't get the courage.  Small town so not a lot of help here.  I just need to take the step.  Maybe this time will be the next step?

Well it is in some ways otherwise we’d have a magic pill and no need for the psychiatric profession. That’s because we are all unique, no brain the same and no lifestyle identical.
 
But if we leave that aside for those professionals , everything else to do with our depression is standard stuff, some things harder than others to process. Some “standard” things are often overlooked. I have a friend that said yesterday “yes, I know” and “yeh, I suppose you’re right” but taking that step to the next stepping stone is often never taken. ""It's too hard"".
 
Basically  improvement for your depression (you might know more ideas?) are- proper diagnosis (very important lets not undermine that but denial is still a problem),  treatment including medication and professional care/therapy, sleep a minimum of 8 hours, diet and exercise, relaxation by multiple means eg classes, muscle tensioning exercises, music, holidays, lifestyle changes some being radical (google- Topic: be radical- beyondblue), seeking peace by spiritual harmony (Google- Topic: inner peace, the glory of being YOU). Your goals- to function, to seek basic happiness, to be realistic.
 
That’s basics. Then there are some particular topics to address in my view that are essential- putting in personal boundaries (Topic: fortress of survival- beyondblue), Building confidence, avoiding toxic people and identifying your triggers (Topic: depression triggers- beyondblue)
 
So if these are mostly logical steps why the need to list them? Because in my own experience and observing loved ones with their journey of life with MI they aren‘t obvious to us. Also our mind doesn’t spit out obvious remedies. We read here daily, members asking these basic questions of what they can do. Being mentally ill often results in learning the hard way. But that way can result in arriving at a black hole and not recovering, it isn’t ideal is it?. Use self help ideas from those that have been there. Birds of a feather think together.
 
The “cake” of Mental illness has many wedges to recovery. Just medication from diagnosis is a great start, ongoing therapy is another essential slice but without all the other basic self help pieces of the cake you are only consuming a portion of the cake.
 
Eat the full cake, approach depression in a calm methodical and persistent manner for the best possible chance at a better life taking into account any suggestion that can help you.
Have you got self help ideas? Post please.

One week ago it happened. A neighbour is a good mate but his wife, a nurse, had her matron hat on when they visited.
Cutting words found their target and once left it was like my brain was being squeezed. I had no control over my mood so, as I usually did, l just allowed the depressive cycle to run its course.
Nobody can help me...but me.
I knew not to ""fight"" it. I also knew not to let myself slide away so l continued with my daily tasks. This time though l wrote out some stickies with the words ""remember when its good, that good will return""...and stuck them everywhere, the garage, my car, my office and my bedside table.
When in our cycle we dont think it will end so we think negatively and although I've not in 20 years gone down the path l did then of two steps from self destruction, l do, while in these cycles...think about it. Why?
Because I'm low. It's a hollow sad feeling of helplessness that my good wife can only hold my hand to help.. we watch the Rosella's feeding, the wild ducks land in our dam and l smile but my laughing was on hold until two hours ago.
Two hours ago l walked into my garage and read my sticky...""remember when its good...."" l knew l had come out of my cycle and life was good again. One week is a long cycle for me, I'm a 3 day guy nowadays, and pre medicine was a two week guy.
At 61yo I'm the result of a narcissistic mother that had all the ingredients for dominance, manipulation and expectation. Nurturing was certainly there but it wasnt enough.
So bossy, dominant people often women, triggers my episodes. If they point their finger and demand you comply then that will trigger it. Knowing a trigger is wonderful. One can work on it to avoid it. 
Our neighbours came over today. I was quieter, still talking but l had a lump in my emotional throat. My mates wife had no reason to repeat her actions of the week before so the visit went well. Of course the price l paid for harmony was l was not fully myself. 
As a sufferer that's studied my triggers, l believe most times I'm  triggered after becoming sensitive for a few days. I'm  learning and its productive.
Learning about yourself sounds stupid. But we cannot rely only on meds, psych visits, friends and family to fix us. We have to gently assess ourselves to seek out the pattern as to what sparks the depressive session.
Only then will we be able to act upon it. 
And dont forget those sticky notes...""remember when it's good, that good will return""....

Hey All,
 I am new here, I haven't ever used something like this before but I just need someone to talk to who actually understands what depression is like. This maybe a long shot, but I was hoping to find someone on here to keep in contact with and be able to talk to, essentially a friend. But unlike all my other friends, I need someone who I can actually tell of my past and of my current experiences of depression. I tend to keep a lot of people at arms length because I am always deathly afraid they're going to reject me or leave anyway, so I guess using the internet to me seems slightly safer (although posting this is making me feel extremely anxious still). 
I wondering if anyone else was looking or needed a friendship like this? 
 Looking forward to any responses.

This may be a bit of a grim topic, so either don't read on, if it's too hard to read, or try to bear with me, but I've been thinking about the nature of depression, and I've been wondering, is depression what makes a chased animal (prey) stop when it is caught, and when it realises there is no hope of escape, stay down, and give up their life for the benefit of their predator?
You see, I've come to realise that when I am depressed, it is usually a time when, ultimately, I see no way to live and make it in the world, when my own life and survival seem completely hopeless with certainty. As soon as there is the slightest glimmer of hope that I can survive and my life will be worth living, the burden on my heart and mind lightens, and my recovery from depression begins. As long as I act on it, of course.
I wonder if this is depression's natural purpose -- to numb our senses just before sudden death, and reduce our physical suffering. If this is the case, then naturally it is only intended to happen just before we are killed, and not the way it happens in our human lives, where depression becomes its own prolonged state of mental and emotional suffering, when we are certain there is no way to make it. The reason we fall into such a prolonged depression has to do with our thinking lives, and in that case the cure in most of our instances is to *do* (without thinking too much), to connect with our inner calling, and seek genuine meaning in our existence, wherever we can find it.

The most important thing is to realise that we are depressed either because we don't see any hope -- and so we need to get out there, explore, and find it (because, trust me, it *is* out there, always -- you just need to look outside the box you've been put in) -- or because our body is out of balance, and giving us the wrong signal -- in which case, for our health, we should take conscious effort to bring our body back in balance (with nutrition, medication, routine, healthy lifestyle, exercise, whatever it takes).
I'm not sure if you're able to follow my reasoning here, but feel free to post your thoughts in this open discussion. Everyone's perspective matters, and there are no right or wrong answers here.
I am thinking that by rationally understanding the reasons behind depression we can learn to better help ourselves when we are down, learn what we need to do to end it, and learn to predict its coming (to an extent).
Would love to hear your genuine thoughts and experiences.

I'm in a low I can't shift after the lack of thought or effort from my partner for my 40th birthday yesterday. Our kids weren't taken to buy me a present.  No card. I would have liked a card and flowers. My present came last night after I expressed disappointment in the morning. But it came with a complaint about how expensive it was and I can't bring myself to use it. I think I've missed a few meds. Maybe that explains my feelings.

Not sure if this is the right place to post this but here goes. After graduating School I suffered severe depression. I was bullied in school and mistreated at home. I've always had a large problem with self-esteem, always feeling people are laughing at me etc. My family have always put pressure on me to have a successful career. After leaving school all of this pressure and my self-esteem issues put my life in a spiral. I was not able to get a job which isolated me and caused me to lose contact with friends. My family also did not understand. Then a miracle happened and I got a job which I was good at and enjoyed for 10 years (I'm now 33). I was able to purchase a house and adopt a cat whom I adore. 

Although I had issues I built a life for myself. This changed in 2015. I got a new job in my organisation. Unfortunately what I was told the role required me to do and the reality and expectations of the job were different. Upon trying to speak to family and friends about how I felt they didn't understand. This has isolated me and I've lost contact with friends and most family. I have a sister who has tried her best to help. 

Every day gets worse. The stress from my job started causing severe depression. I often cry at work and as soon as I finish work I burst into tears and often cry until I fall asleep. I have a lot of trouble sleeping. I was once active and would go to the gym 5-6 times a week but now I can't. I no longer see my nieces I don't want them to see me like this. My sisters say that my nieces ask about me and get upset that they don't see me anymore which makes me sad. I know that the way that I am upsets my sister so I try to not talk to her anymore as I don't want her life to be ruined because of me. 

Due to my low self-esteem I've attached my self-worth to my career and if I don’t have this career I'm worthless. I feel that I'm pigeon-holed into this line of work I hate. Even if I could get another job I feel I will fail. I will lose
my house and lose my cat who I feel is the only one who loves me the way I am. I have discovered problems with my house but am too scared to spend the money to fix them which is adding to the stress. 

I'm lonely and can’t find enjoyment in anything. I'm stuck in this dark hole and feel there's no way out. Writing this or reaching out for help has been hard. I don't want to die but I hate this. I hate the way I feel and I hate myself. I look in the mirror and don't even recognise myself anymore.

Hi All,
New here. I am not even sure if this should go in this section or relationships. I had been seeing this man for about 18 months now. He has always been very reserved and quiet.  He never really laughed or expressed any emtions really. I found it very hard to get close to him or really get to know him at all. A few months in i noticed he was even more withdrawn then usual. He said that he just gets like that sometimes and he doesn't know why. He doesnt want to see anyone and doesn't even want to speak to his family and just wants to be on his own.

When i met him i thought we would relate because I am fairly quiet too. However I do open up to 
people I care about after a time. When i would try to have a conversation with him he would sometimes even come across as annoyed. It was like pulling teeth really. I can say in 18 months i really didnt get to know him at all. Almost like he was completely shut down and void of emotions.  And couldnt have a conversation - I dont know if if it is because he just cant be bothered or he doesnt see how strange that was, or if other things are going on. 

A few weeks ago he broke up with me. I hadn't seen him for a few weeks in person. But we had been messaging as usual and seemed fine. Then a few weeks ago he just said he can't really be bothered with the relationship anymore and was sorry, didnt want to hurt me, etc etc. 

I really don't understand him at all. Someone who really has no close friends at all. Doesnt speak to his family really. We went to his relative house a few times and his sister would try and talk to him, just general chit chat, and he would just reply with one word answers and he would just look bored. He never made any effort to get to know my family.  Would only say hello. 

Has anyone met anyone like this before? Is it extreme depression? Mental Illness? I have no idea. It's all very strange.

So, what do you do when you feel like that? I am trying to get a job but it is a bit hard when the industry you worked in for so long is the one that I burnt out in. Do I just go back to it? I haven't worked since January. I have put uni on hold while I deal with my depression, and adopt ways to cope with it. It is starting to get to me - I have bills stacking up. My partner is working but she has bills and stuff as well. Plus, I don't expect her to look after me. I have tried centrelink just for the interim, until I get back on my feet again. They can't help me. It just makes me wonder what people do? I don't even know if I am making sense in all of this. It is not that I don't want to work. It is just with how I am feeling, it is difficult. I know that it is not permanent but I am wondering what to do in the interim?

New to these forums and first time posting. Found this page tonight when having a 'I'm completely swallowed again' breakdown by myself while my partner sleeps soundly.
But that's exactly it. It's like it's always waiting there, it slowly swallows me. It may be a year or two in between breakdowns but it is always there. Like a monkey on my back. With everyone of my smiles, there is pain?
On the good days, i feel happy and greatful with my life. Genuinely happy, but rest assured just like walking past a window and getting a quick glimpse of something, it's there, always. Waiting to swallow me again when it's too much.
Its like I'm disconnected, unfulfilled, constantly,  even though I know I shouldn't be. Its like something is always missing.
It's like those days when Im feeling good Im wearing a different skin and when I get in private I peel back the mask and just sink back into my disconnected, sad self?
I tutned 30 last month and this has been my life for as long as I can remember. Is this depression? Is that my monkey? I'm exhausted. Will it ever go. Will I ever be normal

I want to open up about this so here I go.
Things have been going pretty well lately. I've been adjusting to a new university which has been challenging but fulfilling. Yesterday I had a pretty unpleasant day. I had three major failures during the day, the last was the worst. I won't get into detail as most people would regard it as a silly minor mistake, but the last one hit me extremely hard emotionally, to the extent that it still effects me now. It has triggered a sudden depressive episode, the worst that I've had in years. Last night I was a mess and this morning I'm not much better. 
I feel exhausted, physically and mentally drained. It's only the third week into the semester and I feel like I need a long holiday. My plans for today have fallen apart and I can't afford this lapse, I have work that I need to keep on top of but I can't find the willpower to leave my house. It's so tempting to stay home as lectures are not compulsory to attend. University is all I have going on in my life and when I lose motivation to pursue and study the subjects that I am supposed to love I feel lost, as though my life suddenly has no meaning. I don't know what to do when I lose all motivation to continue building my life. 
My mood is also changing as I write this. It builds to the point of stability, to the casual mundane level that I experience every day but I can feel that it is founded on the edge of a precipice that I could fall into at any point while in public. I fear that any minor grievance that I experience while out could devastate me. 
I don't really know what I'm asking or seeking with this post. I'm uncomfortable sharing my problems with strangers and I find it difficult to articulate the precise point or purpose that I'm trying to centre this post around. I only know that this is the easiest venue I have for releasing a burden that I'd otherwise keep contained and silent.

My problems start from a young age. I was an only child growing up in the middle of the bush. My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 6 ( at this stage i was aware something was wrong but i was never told why ) when i was 7 I was told I had to stay with my aunty while my parents went away for work, when really my mum was dying, it wasn't till I was at school the next day and was picked up in the morning and told she had died that I even knew mum was sick and so I was raised by my dad. I don't have any close family other than him. When I turned 16 I got a dog named bella and I know this is going to sound stupid but I loved her to peices. When I was sad or lonely I always had her. Just before my 25th birthday I was going to fly home so I could see her as I moved away from my dad. I hadn't seen her in 3 years and it was the one thing I needed. A week before my flight my Bella died suddenly and it felt like my whole world fell apart right then and there. I felt so much guilt for not being there when she needed me most and I think that triggered alot of my messed up feelings because it was the same way I had felt when my mum passed because I wasn't there. My dad now lives alone and never re-married. I always worry about him because my Bella isn't there to keep him company. I also worry about my future as I have no family but him and no close friends I could talk to or could open up to. My boyfriend isnt the nicest person and dosent understand why im always down. Sadly were only stuck together still because of financial probelms. (I come home and lock myself in the bathroom and cry before he gets home because I don't want him to yell at me) I always feel so stressed and completely overwhelmed. Im just a big mess of emotions to be honest and I just don't know how to cope anymore. I'm tired of being exhausted and sad and always hurting on the inside while I put on and act for everyone else.

On Sunday, I had a breakdown day work. Im not focused, I'm lacking motivation, I'm tired the list goes on. I've had this before- emotionally burntout. So I lost it emotionally where I couldn't talk to people, couldn't talk to other staff without wanting to cry.
​I've now noticed I'm since sunday- im drinking, my insomnia has hit a new extreme (no sleep), I want to distance myself from work so I'm rocking up late so I don't get to say hi to people etc. I'm now a walking zombie. Like I'm lacking something. 
Now above the rosters- is an information about work place counselling- work pays only get 4 sessions. I'm in between psychologist since the last one left. Even though I love my boss I can't go up to him and go hey can take advantage of this counselling? 
My boss isn't a stupid person - he knows there's something that clicked over in my head. He asked me how I'm doing I said fine. He didn't believe me.

Hey all at BB,
I'm 22, treatment resistant depression for the past two and a half years.. Recently diagnosed as treatment resistant.. Chronic pain is another new diagnosis.. But they're all just words that I really do not want to take in at this stage.
I've been seeing a psychologist for close to 2 years now.. Maybe 9 months with the current psych.. I donno, I like them, and I am extremely glad to know that they are there, but when it comes to talking to them, I close up. It's always been that way for me, with everyone. I kind of thought I was being fairly open, up until the last couple of session where it's all sort of turned to crap. I've got it stuck in my head, that this is how it's going to be, until my final breath. Nothing seems to help in any way. I've tried meds, psychotherapy, exercise, eating well, seeing friends and family, drinking, weed, holidays, quitting my job, ending my 2 year relationship, I even went out and bought myself a trusty pooch to stand by my side (probably my best decision). 
But yeah, despite all of this, here I am, in the thick of it all still. I feel like there's no hope left for me, and that nothing is ever going to lift this dark, low mood. Like I am going to be hiding this horrible side of myself forever, with no relief.. What sort of a way is that to live? I'm just really fed up with trying, and getting nowhere, in fact, going backwards. I want it all to end, but I know that's not going to happen. 
Currently, I'm looking at a big change, a move to a new city. Somewhere fresh, with new smells, new everything. Away from all that I know and trust. In theory, I know that this may not be a great idea, especially when constantly battling away.. But, staying here, in this town isn't exactly doing me any good anyway.
Anyway, I just needed a rant, and know that someone will read this. So that's something I guess.. Thanks all

I have been recently diagnosed with depression, anxiety and alcohol misuse.  I have to see a psychiatrist and psychologist as well as a regular gp.  All of my life I have been a very strong person who has dealt with a lot of major blows in life.  I used to tell the story about the camel and the straw to people, when things went wrong I'd think, I don't know just how much more this camel can take.  I lost my parents when I was young, had disasterous relationships mainly with domineering, controlling men who used and took from me.  Divorced my husband who was an alcoholic and couldn't stop doing things that were destructive to out relationship no matter how I tried to ask or get him to stop.  I have begun over from scratch with nothing more then once, just driving myself to survive and just when I thought I may have finally have my life on the right track I allowed it to be destroyed by another domineering, thoughtless, aggressive man in my workplace.  I threw away my dream job and two years of study away because of his aggressive, thoughtless opinions that noone else shared and now after so many years of trying so hard I have finally quit.  I no longer care about things I once thought so important and wonder why I bothered even caring.  Just seems a waste of time to me now, why'd I even bother.  I picture that old camel splay legged on the ground now.  People keep saying I need to eat properly and drink less and exercise etc, etc and I can't even bring myself to care anymore.  I drink because it makes me feel better and numbs everything, I no longer care about my health and fitness, if I die who cares.  I used to be very fit and sporty and now I don't even care and there are several physical health problems that I used to ignore as I just used to work hard and soldier on that are now causing me pain and grief.  I have a rotator cuff injury, disc damage in my neck and problems with arthritis in my hands and bad knees, mostly from working my ass off most of my life for people who never gave a damn about me.  I feel like I just want to remove myself from all of society right now and do little more then just breathe, I don't care about so much, except my pets, that's all.  I am getting sick of people who seem to expect me to just get over it and switch on again, be the dynamic person I once was.  I try to explain it as it's like there is a big switch there but I have lost to ability to switch it on and I don't know if or when that will ever come back.

Hi guys!
Does anyone else suffer with tension headaches?
I've been suffering with them literally 24 hours a day for the last 18 months or so.
I didn't know what it was until I went to the doctor and he diagnosed that they were tension headaches, apparently brought on by depression and a serotonin imbalance.
I'm finding it really debilitating and have no idea how to get rid of them.
Has anyone else had them, and if so how do did you manage or get rid of them.
Thanks
Dan

I am finding it really difficult to deal with my job as a primary school teacher while suffering depression AND anxiety. My mind is always in a state of chaos. My mind had the anxiety, so its spinning a million miles a minute, while my body has the depression and I lack the energy and motivation to do anything about the problems that I'm anxious about. It's a vicious cycle. 
At school however it's really hard. The kids that I teach are very challenging, and I leave here almost every day tired, cranky, and doubting myself about my abilities. Can I do this? Am I doing a good job? Do the kids even like me? Maybe I should just go and teach somewhere else, somewhere easier. But I know in my mind that it is a hard job, and that a lot of the staff here struggle, it is a hard school. And I have only been teaching for 3 terms. I'm only 24, I'm fresh out of uni, and I picked one of the hardest places to teach. I've been sworn at by students, called every name you can think of, they mock me, they don't listen, and they are disrespectful. It is so hard to keep coming back here. But the staff here are amazing, I have made some really good friends, so I don't want to leave. I just don't know if I can do this. I worry that the higher up execs are looking at me drowning and talking about me behind my back, saying that I can't cut it, and that they should never have given me the job. I have a lot of self doubt. I've been a sufferer of depression and anxiety for 8 years. I am on medication to help me, I have seen a psychologist before, and she really helped. I know that the things going on in my head is my ""pathological critique"" talking. Saying terrible things to me. I know I just need to tell it to shut up, but it's so hard when I just don't have the energy at the moment.
Does anyone have any coping strategies that they use while they are at work to get through the day/week?

Hi I am Claire 
I am new to the online forum.
I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety a year ago. It has been a big roller coaster in learning that I have depression and anxiety and how to cope with it. Learning what my triggers are and how to try and live with them. As stress is a trigger I was studying full time and working casually. It has been really hard but trying to get through.

My friends don't understand what it's like and I feel guilty going to my dad all the time. 
I've been struggling to find the right person to unload to for the 3 years and I feel like I'm going to explode!

Hi,

This is hard for me to talk about so I will keep the back story short.

I found out I'm bipolar about 6 months ago after possibly suffering with it for 10+ years.

I guess the reason I created an account was just to try find some help in figuring out who the real me is.

How do I know if I’m in a “normal”
state and happy or I’m actually manic?

Am I feeling depressed because I’m thinking about how I’m bipolar or am I actually just in a down swing?

What does it actually feel like when you’re not manic or depressed?

Thanks in Advance

Hi.
I am 27 years old at age 22 I was diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder. I do not recall what happiness feels like. Occasionally life isn't completely painful and I guess that is as close to happy as I get. I have no idea what to do with myself at one point I was mechanic but now after a few days of any job stress kick in and I end up back in hospital. I enjoy life I have friends but they are only really there when I am well, understandably so as even I know I am a pain when Im in a bad place. My life has now becomet 90% attempting to distract from hallucinations and bad feelings so I can barely function as a human. I only stick around because I am scared to die.

I am not sure if you could call me depressed or not. Life has been a bit up and down since my ex broke up
with me a while ago and my whole life crumbled around me. I managed to pick up the pieces, and I feel like I should be happy - I have friends and family, I have a job, I have food to eat and a roof over my head - but I feel guilty that I don't feel happy, and no motivation to go to work or to do the things that used to make me happy. 
I feel like I am in a perpetual state of being alone, like I don't really connect to anyone. I feel like I don't know who I am anymore, and I feel like a failure because my life isn't where I thought I would be at this point in time. I am dating someone new, who I really like. I am terrified of letting myself fall in love with him because I am terrified of being hurt again but he also says things to me which makes me question why we are dating or why he even likes me. So every week it is like I am waiting for him to break up with me therefore I am constantly stressed and on edge. I don't want to talk to him about it because I know where it would head and I'd prefer to bury my head in the sand right now instead of being realistic. I think I also like escaping from my life into his life because I am so sad in mine. 

I used to be this really happy full of life motivated person and now I have no drive or motivation to do anything. Does anyone else feel the same as me? I feel like I am half alive.

Hi team
I feel awful for even writing this because on the outside my life is a dream: I am in a committed relationship with a man who adores me, I am fit, healthy and exercise regularly and I have a career that has taken me to heights I should be proud of. I should be happy. I should be in control.
 But I'm not...
 I feel numb and if I'm not feeling numb I'm feeling anxious about how I'm failing (at what? I can't work that out). I have regular moments when I am so sad that I read suicide forums for hours and I just sob (cry is too light of a term). 
 I've suffered with mental health issues in the past (ex-anorexic and depression during and post an abusive relationship) but my life is great - literally what I've always wanted - but why am I so sad?
And on top of the sadness is irrational anger, irritability and impulsive spending. My irrational anger manifests itself with my partner and I lash out. Sometimes physically. I am half his size so I never hurt him - but what kind of person does that make me?
My mood swings wildly from a million miles an hour (I am an executive in a role that requires creativity) to irritable and to be honest, downright spiteful and nasty.
 I love those around me dearly yet a part of me is always slightly disappointed and envious when they succeed. Even when I have helped them to do well and I love them. What kind of monster is like this?
I am at breaking point. I am having my hormones investigated but my body is otherwise in tip top shape, I am exceptionally fit and I eat well, seldom drink and take no drugs. But I can't keep it together. I see a psychologist. I do the things I think are right but I can't grapple this.
My anger, sadness, anxiety and feelings of inadequacy runs my life. I know I have people who love me but I feel so alone.
I am reaching out to see if anyone at all feels like this. Or if it's something that will never get better. In which case I have decisions to make. I can't keep putting my partner through this

Hi I didnt have anyone to talk to so I thought I would write my thoughts down it usually helps some what. My carer has the week off and he is such a big part of my life and does so much with me and for me, but most importantly he listens. While hes away my daughters my carer but she works full time so Im feeling very isolated, I dont have people I can call upon and I woke up today very depressed, not knowing what to do with myself, I dont leave the house except to go to Doctors appointments thats my agoraphobia, which I hate.
My mind is taking over me, my thought process is not good at the moment, some dark thoughts creeping in.
Anyway as usual thank you beyond blue for listening to me and for giving me a safe place to vent
Thanx Annie

How do you function on a depressive episode? I'm a uni student and i have so much to do. I'm trying, I really am, I've been taking my meds I've been scheduling therapy sessions. It all feels like I'm faking my way through ""recovery"". But I do it because it's my responsibility to, as I'm an international student here in Australia on a scholarship. The pressure to go on and push all that that's bothering me to the back of my mind is immense. I cannot have an honest conversation with a therapist for fear of them not understanding me. I understand their perspective but I need someone to understand my perspective as well. I feel so disconnected from ""reality"". Constantly questioning everything and being sucked into this vortex of confusion and paranoia. I feel like giving in to it and completely withdrawing myself. But I keep going on because as long as I'm here and given this opportunity I cannot be that selfish. I did give in to the selfishness once. Ended up in the psych ward. I cannot ever go back there again. So I need to get through at least this year. But I keep falling back into dark days where I'm useless and barely functioning and I can't afford to have these days because uni does not stop for anyone. I don't know what to do.

Hi guys, this is gonna be a long one
 Basically I had taken a week off work during the new year (its my first job and it is full time and not very satisfying as it is a desk job.) I found that getting through the day wasn't a big deal before I started feeling depressed and anxious about an incident that happened with my boyfriend of almost 3 years during the a holiday week I had taken off. We had a weird argument about something so incredibly small. I am very stubborn yet also very passive when I'm annoyed. I get annoyed over the smallest things but when asked to explain why I am I feel silly because I know how stupid they sound and how insignificant it really is which then makes me feel worse.  Anyway this fight caused us to basically break up but then get back together because when I told my parents why we broke up they made me realise that there was no actual real reason as to why we broke up since we were completely fine before this incident.
We also see each other everyday. Which I didn't think was a problem at all before all of this. We both work during the day and while mine is basically 9-5, he sometimes works half days so he has time for the gym and footy training etc. in my eyes we were getting the time we needed to sustain a healthy relationship. In my own time I did what I wanted to do as did he. We talked about what happened and then decided to just try and work it out but being in each other's company felt a bit forced like something wasn't right and then that's when we broke up^ basically what I touched on up there. AKA we are still together 
now that's when this all started. He is the most amazing, selfless and generous person and I don't want to be nor can I think of being with anyone else but post all of this I have been feeling incredibly anxious and depressed and wake up every morning with all these over thinking thoughts about do I actually love him anymore? I feel like I can't feel love even though I know I love him because if I didn't I wouldn't be fighting for us this much. I am seeing a psychologist and have just recently been put on medication. I haven't been able to go to work without crying and I haven't been able to go to work more often than not. My boyfriend promises he's here for me forever ¬ going anywhere but why do I feel like this is just too good to be true? this has made me start to question everything about myself, what do I even like? I have no future, no passion or interest for anything. It just all gets scary

Hi.. 
This is my first post so I am not too sure what to say so here goes..
I have depression - ive been depressed and on medication since very young age, only just recently I've stopped taking my meds as it makes me feel completely yuck (tried multiple different anti-depressants through out the last 12 years) I know I need to go to the doctors and talk about new medication or something else.
I just feel like it's over for me, I have nothing to show for myself other than debt and no motivation in life... I am currently unemployed, I apply for atleast 5-10 jobs a day if possible but that's only when I can connect to WiFi as my phone has been cut off, lucky I can still receive incoming calls just in case an employer does contact me  (which no luck yet) 
Some people ask me what happened to me that had caused me to be so depressed.. but there is no answer because my childhood was great, no traumatic experiences, perfect caring parents and siblings, I always had friends and enjoyed being outside in the sun. by the age of 11 I was already noticing how I'm changing - how I'm over feeling/thinking some things, stopped being so bubbly and energetic. Once high school hit it was just a big whirlwind of negative thoughts and actions I only lasted 2 and half years in high school because I couldn't take the bullying, I stopped paying attention and just wagged every day possible. 
Once I left school I worked at woolworths and stayed there for roughly 3 years, I gained new friends and had some sort of enjoyment in life but that didn't last long, I met this girl and thought I feel I love. long story short I was introduced to hard drugs and the world drugs have created, so what little life I did create for myself I only destroyed it myself again.
4 years that went on and the metal abuse I got was something evil, I feel evil sometimes knowing how my life has been. I left her and met this guy and at first my life was moving forward again, I was working and living out of home and just enjoying the little things, then one day I just felt sick like anxiety attack of the century and I went home sick from work to find out my boyfriend cheated on me with out housemate and she was pregnant with his baby...... I died - well it felt like I died. I didn't move for 3 weeks and lost about 20 kilos. But I was silly and went back to him 6 months later(will explain another time)Right now I'm extremely unhappy and lost, no job - no money - no friends just feels like I have no life

Hello
 Newbie here. As the title says, feeling blah. As well as being depressed, I'm suffering extreme insomnia and anxiety. I feel so disconnected from the world right now - I'm constantly surrounded by people but feel alone and within minutes the sound of someone breathing (or doing anything) annoys the crap out of me.
I've lost all interest in everything and just running on auto pilot. Generally feel like everything and everyone is soul destroying.
 No idea about the point of this post is lol but it's getting late and while I'm exhausted I can't sleep and soon it will be just me alone with my thoughts.

I've been feeling so low for so long that it doesn't feel possible to ever be happy again. Its been over two years since a traumatic event happened where my entire world changed over night. I can't stop thinking about it, I relive it all the time. I'm tired, I feel so defeated. I have tried opening up to friends and family but they shut me down or don't respond. Most my friends left me at the same time this all happened.. It use to be my family that made me happy but now im constantly lying saying im ok just to avoid the lectures that ""I should be over it by now"" or the ""you'll be ok"". I feel like im trying to piece the puzzle of my life back together but the pieces don't fit anymore. Happiness is very short lived and even my favourite things don't make me happy anymore. I have tried counselling with 3 different people.. money is tight so its been another stress.. I have been on medication but my last doctor took me off it because i got worse and couldnt control my tears. Does anyone have any advice on what to do because I can't keep doing this alone. My heart is so heavy all the time. I just want to be happy again but I don't know how to fix it anymore and I feel like no one cares.

Hi Everyone,
 Just after some guidance. Over the last year or so I have noticed myself becoming slowly more emotional. I find it extremely hard to be alone, and if I am alone I often cry from loneliness. I have a lot of friends and am very social, and in these situations I am fine, however the second I am alone everything hurts again. I live with sister and her boyfriend who are expecting a baby, and I am so excited for them. I have a boyfriend of 2 years who I may not 100% trust and I am concerned this has provoked my sadness. I am definitely an over-thinker and he has never given me any reason to not trust him, I am creating scenarios in my head and I can acknowledge that. I don't know how to stop. My ex cheated on me multiple times which may be my reason for lack of trust. My father also cheated on my mother for many years. Are these feelings just the product of old wounds?

I find that I talk myself into being more sad, and making the situation worse for myself. I am on the pill and have been for many years which I know can affect your hormones dramatically, however I have never had any past issues with depression on the pill. I just need to stop feeling like this and I don't know where to start. I have a history of social anxitey, but more in the sense that I don't like speaking in public professionally like at work or when I was studying. I can handle social situations well (I think?). I have found that sometimes I overcompensate and am quite extroverted to cover up some insecurities? 
 Has anyone ever felt this way?
Thanks

Hi :)
 I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and Melancholy. I've been working in a Call Centre role which I thought would be good for me as I'm a caring, empathetic person.  However, I'm finding that by half-way through the working week, I want to have absolutely nothing to do with people as I'm finding the Call Centre roll incredibly emotionally and mentally draining - excessive verbal and visual stimulation as well as trying to manage my bipolar on a daily basis.  It is taking a toll on my relationship with my boyfriend - he knows and feels that I'm not my usual self at the moment and is doing a lot to help out around the house.  Sometimes when he has a bad day at work, he will start to order me around - not good in any case but even more so when I'm already emotionally and mentally drained.  It has lead me to, on more than one occasion to 'bite back' at him by saying things like 'Don't tell me what to do!, I don't have to tell you everything!'  Needless to say it compounds my already negative feelings.  
I guess it gets compounded by when I wanted to do a Clinical Coding Course - which is what I actually enjoy doing and doesn't leave me as drained at the end of the day - he initially said that I could and then said he would think about it and then 3 days later he said I couldn't do it.  The course costs $995 and we are both working full time and can afford it.  He does have a history in this relationship of being controlling.
Please help.
 
Regards

I should probably preface this by saying that late November I lost my best friend to a new relationship with a partner that seems possessive, and stop there, because my open opinions on her would get this post blocked.
 Feel free to call me Bel or Sam. They/them pronouns are fine.
Three days ago is when it started. Out of the blue, I was listening to a song that reminded me of the events, and I brushed it off as a coincidence. It still felt kind of bad to have the thought/memory of losing a friend of seven years, but I figured, if he's happy, it's worth it. I'd assume he's happy, because he hasn't contacted me about him breaking it off with her.
 Yesterday wasn't as good. I could feel my mood slipping, slowly but surely. Like holding onto a weight that's just a little too heavy. I was reading through Tearjerker tropes (it's a hobby) and thinking that I could relate to people's experiences in video games (which is/was my main escape). The voice in your head that's the harsh truth -- can be helpful, can be hurtful -- bluntly made me remember that no, I can't. It's a long, long story. I ended that night in a depressive low I haven't been in for almost five years, then drinking myself back to happiness. Bed at 3:45 am.
Then I woke up this morning. I didn't want to get out of bed. I slept another three hours, woke up, couldn't get back to sleep, stayed for half an hour before moving to Google to find anything that might help. I figured I may as well make an account here, so here I am, pouring out my feelings (or lack of) in the hope anyone can help.
I don't want to eat, I don't want to drink. Saying I don't want to do anything is probably frustrating to hear, but it's true. I haven't been to a psych in thirteen years, haven't been on meds for ten. I don't want to start either again.
 I don't know where I'm going or what I'm looking for, in this post or in general. I honestly don't know if there's anything to do or any place to go.

So, I'm 36 later this year and have been thinking about a baby ALOT! I mean, the clock is ticking!! Spoke to my Psychiatrist today and he was saying that I'd come off all my meds and best be as stable as possible before getting pregnant. It just got me thinking. Obviously the first thought was to start weening myself off my meds and what changes I can make so that I can be stable and deal with this black dog. Then I thought what if I do all this and its just not meant to happen and I don't meet someone. aaccckkkkk There was so much talk about my meds being safe during pregnancy I didn't think weening off would be needed so it's a bit scary. Sorry, I'm waffling.

I wonder frequently how I manage to keep going day in day out. The answer is there isn't any choice I guess. I'm just being carried,  no,  dragged along. I have for years had this visual image where I am tied to the back of a truck's tow bar and being dragged along the ground, bumped over rocks and gravel and just lying limp becoming more and more bloodied. This funnily enough has given me comfort at times. There has been the rare occasion where I have been able to pull myself up onto the back of the truck and maybe even come close to driving the truck,  actually being in control. I inevitability fall off again and go back to the daily grind of being dragged along against my will. This is depression for me. Thanks for listening.

Hi... 
First time on this forum or any forum. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II with major depressive tendencies and social anxiety disorder. 
I have just started a big university with over half million students and thought I would at least make one friend. I haven't... I have no one in my life, never had a relationship, live on my own with no one to talk too. Just feel so alone. I don't know what to do. I try and reach out to people but they don't want to give me a chance. Sad face. 
Just thought someone might have an idea as I don't know what to do. Thank you.

For the past 4 years I have been on varieties of anti depressants for my professionally diagnosed chronic depression. Non seemed to work with the most evident factor being the side effects. Still I persisted in an effort to be 'normal'. Coupled with counseling and psychiatric professional help, I was determined to beat it. But it just got worse. The highs higher and more erratic, and the lows devastating. I lost my job, family, friends, house, car - my life disintegrated with me as an active participant.
Recently is sought further professional help and have been told that that in fact I suffer from/with BP2. The anti depressants I had been taking were exacerbating my condition. Now mood stabilizers have been added to the daily regime so it's back to square one, but the damaged caused has been done so why this constant pursuit to be socially acceptable. That is enough pressure to drive anyone mad. I'll give it 3 months then reassess what, if any, meaning there is to all of this

Hi everyone. I've looked through the threads before and I can never find anyone else struggling with binge eating, so I'm here to start my own, and perhaps find others who are in the same boat as me.
I've just eaten an insane amount of food.  I couldn't even tell you *what* I ate, as all I did was go from the couch to the fridge. I feel sick now, and this is not something strange for me. Binge eating has always been the way that I deal with anything... I'm now a very large person with a heap of medical issues.  Why hasn't that scared me to turn it all around?!
Depression is unfair, and it never makes sense.  However, I think that I can think of some things which may have brought the dark cloud back.  Last week at work, I was stressed and overwhelmed.  I'm in a job which I find incredibly stressful in a company I don't believe in.  Then on the weekend my partner and I had to put one of our kittens down after it was attacked by a dog.  The heat isn't helping and makes me want to just hibernate inside my house, in the air con.  I am disappointed in myself for not going to work yesterday or today. I am disappointed that I am back here.

Hi All,
 I joined beyondblue a while back and I believe I may have even posted back then, however it wouldn't have been a lot as I can barely recall what I posted. No doubt it would have been about my struggles at that time.
I've been absent from the site as I believed my depression was pretty much in check, if not gone. As it does and as it has continued to do for the past two years my dark companion reminded me of its existence. 
I have come to accept this time around though that this will infact continue to be a rollercoaster ride, my decision however is do I ride 'The Beastie' or 'The Demon'? (I'm hoping most of you are familiar with Australia's Wonderland lol)
I acknowledge that I need to make positive lifestyle changes and commitments in being able to effectively manage my depression and anxiety and am hoping to use this forum, to interact with as many of you as possible as a healthy and proactive companion in managing my condition. 
I hope to be able to share my story with you soon :)

Hi all, I have been a sufferer of depression anxiety ongoing on and off over the last ten years or so. 
i the last couple of years I have started a career and I have been in my current job 2.5 years. I had a bad episode last year and took some time off work. Work related stress may have also been a contributing factor. Now my work is wanting to contact my dr. I have not disclosedmi am a sufferer. They are also saying I have a ""pattern"" of excessive absences. 
 
What at do I do. How do others manage this ongoing. I don't want to give up my good job or earning potential ongoing but I am hesitant to disclose to be discriminated against or seen as a liability. I want to manage my leave and now I am feeling better, but with my condition I cannot promise it will not happen again in future. Am I doomed to a life of excessive leave or lower paid jobs/ part time employment. What is the answer. Interested to know if anyone has found  ways to negotiate this with their employer which work. Someone give me some hope/advice.

So I started a new job and within the week I was having horrible panic attacks and feeling depressed. I had taken myself off my medication about 6 weeks prior to this episode. The doctor puts me back on the meds and gives me one month sick leave. In this time I have been found to be anaemic and am being investigated for reasons for this. I also have contracted another cold despite being (mainly) away from society and having spent all of January battling a nasty reoccurring sinus infection.

Now I am approaching the end of my sick leave and I am still suffering fatigue and have a poor immune system. Furthermore, a big side effect of the medication for me is insomnia. Anxiety and depression still having 'those days' but generally under control. I spoke with my manager and my options are to come back to work in a week and I was warned I would need to hit the ground running, or have another month off and come back when it is less busy and I could potentially ease back into it. I got the idea they would prefer I come back 100% - no fatigue/issues with my immune system, however the con is that I continue to miss work and fall further behind.
I do not want to let the team down if I come back to work and am not performing well/need to take further sick leave, however I am feeling ready to return to work. Just a little lost and am wondering if anyone has some wisdom...?

hi, I am new to the forum, I actually came across it when I typed into google 'why do i hate myself so much'
I'm the crankiest mum and wife, I despise that about myself at the moment... I want to be happy and loving again. 
I sometimes believe I sound like my father who would constantly put me down and would yell and scream at us as kids, because he was so anxious we would get the blame for all sorts of things, I sound exactly like that, then when I calm down, nice mum appears for 10 minutes because I feel terribly guilty for my kids, then sad stroppy me appears again.
I'm always in tears when no one is around I am depressed yet again, but I feel I have anxiety more so this time around. I really don't want to resort to medication as the first time was horrendous. 
I know what I can do to help I.e a walk a day, healthy eating, friendships, but do not have the care or energy to do this. Sorry for the sad long post.

I quit my job, lost my friends (because of anxiety and depression) so now it's all getting worse.
 i have a partner who is a chef so he is barely ever around but when he is I have my moments and he never understands but makes me feel so small. I don't know to explain myself anymore? I don't know what to do anymore... no job, no friends....nothing I'm just in my early 20s also I feel like everything is just so wrong  
 
I would love any possible help

Hi guys,
Ive been feeling so disconnected, emotional, sad and frustrated with myself.
Ive been going through some anxiety tagged along with some mild depression and the healing process is getting me down because im not where i want to be. and often wonder when i feel like me again.
Theres been an emergency in my family a couple of days ago and naturally this has triggered my anxiety (""oh no what if that happens to me"") which sounds selfish when i read it out loud, but thats what ive been thinking to the point of creating my own symptoms. So that coupled with the sadness im feeling for my family member has been very hard for me. Im trying to be strong for them (thankfully they are pulling through now) but im also trying to be strong for me too.
I schedule my motivation but i feel myself treading water somewhat this week. 
I constantly ask myself, when will i feel normal, when will i feel ""right"", when will I feel like me again... am I losing my mind? My eyes watering even writing this.
Im going to the gym and exercising at least 3 days a week, i eat well, i have support but this current situation has pushed me back a few steps.

Any words of encouragement and familiarity to the situation would be really helpful right now.
Thanks BBB (Beyond Blue Buddies)

I've been living with depression for a few years, it has been made worse by a lot of traumatic things happening this past two years including losing my mum to cancer, my partner becoming addicted to ice then cheating on me and losing my gran just to name a few;seriously my life has been like a horrible movie, I didn't think so much could happen to me at one time. 
I have always been the bubbly, positive and strong person and I feel like now that I'm not, I still have to pretend to be because people expect me to be.
I no longer want to reach out to people because in my head I think that creates more expectations such as the expectation to get better etc. 
It's so stupid and it's my issue, I know that my family and friends are there for me but I just want to be alone or just be with my pets. 
What am I doing? I'm pulling away from everyone because when I'm alone I have no pressure on me to be anyone or act a certain way.  Why am I doing this?

There is not much worse a feeling that having what l call a ""scatter brain"". The term isnt meant to be derogatory, but in fact accurate.
When my depression was at its worse 1992-2009,l had extreme difficulty focussing on the job at hand. My mind would wander and this had consequences. Flying a model airplane you need 100% concentration. I often crashed and other modellers wondered why. I'd also fall into an emotional low bevause of it.
Mind overload, burnout, stress,all leave our minds in a state that feels like we've  lost half of our capacity to think. We have to come to terms with this massive change to our lives. That's the hard  part.
To claw back our thinking/concentration ability we need to drop off other unwanted cargo we can do without.
Eg friends that are taxing...takers that dont return the goodwill. Be kind because they often have no clue they are takers. Drift away if possible...less drama...the aim is to lessen your drama not create more.
Finances. Get them in order. Years ago my wife revamped our bill payment methods. We now do a lot of monthly direct debit. We buy power when we get our power account in surplus. Etc
Health. We grow vegies galore. Our carrots always twist but are great for juicing. Cherry trees great for prevention of gout. The vitamins must assist the mind. Fresh is best.
Exercise. At least 20 minutes of fast walking will result in the dropping of your blood pressure then it will rise again. Its best for a fit and healthy cardio vascular system. More oxygen for the brain. Check with your GP as to what is advisable.
Relaxation. Everyone has their own technique. For me its finding a place near home amongst forest trees where l can listen to pan flute music or my favourite Youtube Maharaji Sunset. It feels like l create empty mind space once l do this. Our minds need time out.
Laughter. A good comedy lifts my mood.
Prioritise. Focus on one thing at a time.
Distractions. My wife and l came to an agreement. If she talks to me and l raise my hand, she knows I'm concentrating on my bb forum. She also knows l will give her attention within a short time. Some of us dont have the capacity to divide our attention to several things at once.
We might not be able to focus well, to counter our scattered mind, but we can make changes to move aside some obstacles to give our mind space to think better. Less clutter.
Have you got ideas on how to focus better?

We once drove 12 hours for a 2 week holiday my wife and 2 girls, when we arrived at lunchtime all was good. At 3pm I was in the car on my way home alone. My wife and girls continued there holiday and ended up flying home when the holiday had finished and I picked them up from air port. 
We flew in to Tasmania for a 2 week holiday and day 1 was excellent on day 2 at 1030 am I was by myself on a airplane flying back to Brisbane.
Guns and Roses concert I left before they came on stage, I got to see the cover band,
My wife paid $1500 to meet and greet kiss and have a fans lunch before the concert, I got there early and 10 mins before the actual event was suppose to start I took off like a rocket and went home.
My friends and extended family call me the great Houdini, I am an escape artist if I am at family or friends house it not unusual for them to find me missing, I could quietly slip away unnoticed and just go home without telling a sole.
At the footy with friends they were waiting for me to return with drinks, I was heading straight for the train station and went home. 
I was a star football player 1st division captain and best and fairest at half time one day I just jumped in my car still with boots on and just took off home.
Grand final day again I am 1 of the better players everyone dreams to play in a grand final, I did not show up I sat at home on my own in my bedroom.
Grand final day number 2, after the siren I kicked a goal to win the game by 3 points it was the biggest win and celebration this club had ever seen, I did not turn up to the club that night for awards, dinner, party, 
No matter where we are I will eat dinner stand up rinse my plate tidy my area and nobody says a thing they just no I have finished and I am ready to go home. I don't rush or hassle anyone else I will always get my own way home or return and pick up my wife and kids up.
I will answer people if they talk to me but if they get to talkative I will get up and leave, my kids don't seem to annoy me I can handle there noise, arguing, winging and demands but anyone else don't even try.  
I hate appointments and times I have an appointment today, I am already sweating, worried, in a panic it annoys me having to go out I am starting to get angry.

Beyond Blue, down and out, ashamed, embarrassed, confused, alone, sad, angry, scared are some emotions people who suffer depression go
through, crying, soar, tired, fidgety wanting to be alone and sometimes wish weweren’t here at all. Feeling helpless, feeling worthless, feeling a burden and left wondering why life is so cruel. Little things can seem like a major task, getting out of bed, picking up kids, doing shopping, it all becomes just too much, when the phone rings what do they want, no thank you I am busy, I don’t feel well, I hurt my leg, I have a headache, I have an appointment are some excuses I use, I really don’t need company or to be around people I am ok. We all can relate to the ones we love and care for who try to encourage us to get out, participate and get over it, we have all heard, once you get there you will be fine, give
it ago, you never get out loosen up. Sometimes it is necessary and seems appropriate to create and force a fake smile trying your hardest to be natural and enjoy a happy moment is an effort. Talking to people can make us feel weird, it’s not that you are not valued or liked but in our head our reply feels unnatural and fake because it’s hard to focus on what has been said,sometimes people who have been there can
explain best, I live it, I have lived it and without experience it’s hard to give advice or understand what its really like, you can read books and study and have all the medical degrees but to live a day in the shoes of a person with depression is what you need to get the full scope of what it’s like. I guess some see us weak but each day we live and try to deal with this is the strong approach, it’s never easy and always tough, each day we hope we wish we have good intentions that it will get better but as the sun goes down and comes uphere we go again. I wish there was a way to make me happy, to live life, to be able to smile, to have friends, to go out and be normal we all want that. All of us have friends, we all have a lot of people who have our back and some good strategic plans, we are club of our own we are Depression Club we stand for support, help and being there for each other, it’s not shameful it just shows we are pretty cool and we really care. When your turn has come and you have the help you need and are back on your feet, don’t forget depression club. We can beat this and have a better life, hang in there and keep up the fight.

Bang Bang bang loud symbols are what I hear in the back of my head,  Bla Blah Bla Blah Bla is what I thought you said, you ask me this and
you ask me that honestly Im not interested in any of that crap, I get you are
trying to be nice, and help me see things I can achieve, but right now just
leave me be, I want you to know I don’t mean to seem mad I still have feelings
and bleed and hurt I am just a little sad, 
I am a tough person and once was very talented at Kung Fu the way I feel
Now it would be a struggle to tie my shoe, I understand it appears I am lazy and
seems I am always in bed the fact is if I had no place to hide id most likely
be dead. I can handle a hello and I like 2 mins of your time but when you get
excited and go on and on its time for me to fly, Its rude not listen or have interest
in your friends but when I am listing I just struggle to comprehend, I certainly
aint stupid and I am certainly not dumb but when my head is spinning everything
and everyone is a pain in the bum, people look at me and occasionally stair, for their sake I pray
they don’t poke the bear, my anger is getting out of control, sometimes I can
go off my head like an absolute @@@ Hole, To look at me I am fine it is possible
some lady’s would find me divine, What people can’t see is the struggle inside
my head that’s the reason I am always in bed.

Hi, looking for some comfort, reassurance I guess. I've previously posted in anxiety forums
https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/online-forums/anxiety/anyone-dealing-with-ergophobia-
And
https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/online-forums/anxiety/feeling-disconnected-my-world-has-fallen-apart-or-has-it-
Shared those to offer some background. Not feeling especially anxious now, but more down. I think the last few weeks of intense anxiety have drained me. 
Found out I am pregnant. It was planned by me and my husband. But when I told him he seemed dismayed, disappointed. A few days later told me he had feelings for someone else (mentioned in previous post). We've been married less than 4 months. Anyway, he told her, and that has helped him to let it go for now. 
But I'm feeling so down about it. He knows that. I feel like I have inconvenienced him, that he doesn't love me how he said he did when we got engaged. To be honest, I feel he got married because it's expected by our age (30's) and his family. He says he loves me etc and will make it all up to me (my pregnancy is tainted, our marriage, our wedding day, our engagement - because he was lying to me about someone else. 
Anyway,I'm absolutely exhausted. Pregnancy related, and stress. I have one friend I talk to about this, I can't keep bugging her for emotional support. Not close to my family either. Just want someone to talk to. To tell me it'll be ok and I will feel happy and safe in my relationship again, that my husband will let me feel happy about the baby without me feeling ashamed.

 To look at me I look very fit and I have a good muscular I guess natural build because I don't do any training. I am very clean and I dress tidy and smell nice, I can hold a conversation and can turn on some charm if needed, people think I am amazing, people think I am the ducks nuts, people look up to me, people think I am as cool as a cucumber, people come to me for advice, people ask for my help and knowledge.
 Now I will tell you straight from the horses mouth what I think about those people, I wish those people would jam their opinions, thoughts, questions, where the sun don't shine, I wish they looked up at Donald Trump not me, if they want to know the answer to something I feel like saying have you ever heard of Google, If I wanted to talk to you I would have come over and said hello, obviously I didn't so why are you talking to me. I am not cool like a cucumber in fact I am smoking hot and the littlest thing can trigger me into a rage. I don't give you a birthday present never have and I never will why in the hell would you randomly give me a present. Neighbour across the road, your ok to wave too every now and then but don't hassle me with a Xmas card with a reindeer on it wishing me a happy Xmas you ain't getting a card back mate. Other neighbour when I am out the front of my house, tell me  where in the hell am displaying a sign or do I have a calling card or something printed on my head saying come over and say hello id love to talk crap to you and waste 20mins of my time. Leave me alone, leave me in silence I don't bother you please don't bother me, don't call me and I won't call you, I don't do Facebook or any social media, don't snap chat me don't twitter me leave me alone. . Lady at the servo don't ask how I am today you really could care less and your smile couldn't be any faker. My doctor you are not that interested I notice you overlook a few things or don't care but the one thing you never overlook and you are brilliant at is getting your Medicare form signed so you get your money. I am depressed and just can't handle life to well and I struggle to deal with everyday tasks. My little phone if that things beeps or rings its in always in danger of being short circuited or throw a very long way what makes it valuable to me is music only and when I listen to music and the song is interrupted by a call or message I will go into a fit of rage and have breathing problems. That's my rant time to bury my head into a pillow and sleep it off.

I don't know what is wrong with me. During the week I am fine, busy with work and try not to think about things in my life that make me unhappy. When I am at work I just get on with it and put a smile on my face and everyone comments on how up beat and happy I am. I am friendly with everyone but nobody wants me as a friend. On the weekends I feel really alone and stay home by myself a lot. I wake up on weekends and spend an hour or two crying in bed before I get up. I don't know why but once I feel like that it's so hard to change and most weekends I spend the whole weekend in my friday night pyjamas crying and feeling sad and hopeless.

Hi
I had my baby 1 month ago and struggled from the get go. With breast feeding and then got mastitis and had to change to formula feeding, i then have become depressed as a result of this and the changes mother hood has done to my life, i love my son and he is adorable but some days i wish i could have my own life back, i have started seeing a therapist, but some days i just need help looking after him when my mood crashes and my husband and mum supported me at the beging but now they don't understand and just expect me to snap out of it and don't believe i have depression and say its just my hormones and I'm starting to feel like i can't talk to them anymore about it as they are just sick of hearing about it. Some days im fine and i have a great day other days i just want to curl up in bed and stay in bed all day so i have to ask my mum or husband to take the day off work to help look after my son and i feel like they won't anymore and expect me to just get on with the day, which i find hard when im alone to look after our son. When i have bad days i just feel very flat and tired, when i have good days im positive and have heaps of energy and do heaps with my son, really i just need somone to talk to on my bad days as i feel i can't talk to my mum or husband anymore and as my son sleep well at night and i get rest they expect me to be fine. I hate when i have bad days and i don't want to feel the way i do on those days i would just snap out of it if i could but i can't.  And i never know what type of mood i will be in until that day which makes it hard as my husband leaves early for work and i have to call him to come back and he doesn't understand why im upset and asks what made me upset and i don't know i just wake up feeling that way. So yeh basically just want someone to talk to or i think i will get worse.

I often wake up feeling ok in my mood,  have good intentions to get things done in my day including my business,  but then as the morning progresses my mind turns to feeling sad, and i have this war going on in my head -  ""think positive"", ""no dont think like that"",  I feel a shift for the better for a few moments and then back down again.  I look around my home that was once so organised,  I go into my office and I just feel numb,  I dont want to face any of my clients work,  I dont want to work on their projects and I can see deadlines coming and I'm just numb.        Working on my own is not helping and I wonder if getting a job for someone else would help,  but that's another problem what do I do? and no one wants to employ someone who's been self employed for 30 years...    its all too hard and my body and  mind is just numb,  I feel nothing and have no passion or happiness anymore.

Im having a bad night a continuation of a really bad day, Ive really been struggling with my depression lately, more so than ever. I feel like Ive got a battle going on in my mind constantly, there seems to be a good voice and a bad voice and they fight all the time, which is very difficult to live with, its happening all the time for example, I will try to do something positive which is good but then the bad side says no your not going to do that which pushes me down again. I was wondering does anybody else feel this way and do they have any advise.
I have wonderful medical support and my family are just brilliant for looking after me, for that I will be forever grateful.
Thanx for letting me vent BB, I really appreciate this forum.

Hi there,
I'm new here. Male mid-30s. Was made redundant last July but I managed to find another job in a more complex indstry and a step up beginning in August. 3 months in however, things aren't looking so great.
A senior of mine who has been working with the boss for a decade has been giving me one set of time expectations but later berating me for not completing or understanding the contents since it was ""such a simple task"". And because its simple, she sometimes keeps briefings really brief. I have from time to time asked to clarify or for further pointers and all I've been told was ""It's your job to read through all the info even if it's a lot and your ability to summarize"" or ""didn't I tell you this before! *rollseyes*""
I do admit my attention to details has been lacking due to sleep apnea. I am currently seeking treatment for that. 
That said, the boss mentioned his concerns about my work performance, and while I agreed to work on them, I have voiced my concerns about said senior's behaviour and how I was feeling rather depressed lately, but am also seeking help for depression and sleep apnea, all I got was ""that person is actually nice, you'll have to take criticisms constructively and learn to work well with her and don't take things personally""
I've tried being more positive after that meeting but she continues to highlight every mistake I have made in an e-mail with the boss cc'ed in. The stress did eventually take it's toll on me work and performance wise that I took a few days off for a break.
 When I got back , I was notified that I'm being performance managed and if I don't improve soon, I may be out of a job really soon.
I admit that it is partially my fault, like not being able to keep a hold of my emotions, breaking down in office sometimes and feeling too miserable to focus. 
Not suicidal and I do have family support but I do try to look positive as my mom and I are very prone to depressive modes. 
Mentor advised that I was a bad fit for that role for the industry I was in as I am quite non-confrontational by nature and not very resilient (to which I agreed) which does not translate well to my survival long term. 
 I get dreams of being a long-term unemployed and when I think about my future, I can only see a dark empty space. It's a very lonely feeling and I weep frequently at the thought of this. I tried to think positively but that dark feeling still remains. Confidence totally shattered, feeling very lost in life now.

Hi everyone. 
Unsure really what to say. I have been living with major depression since 2008 with medication and in the early days a psych. I am a hard worker giving everything to my job rarely taking sick leave. 
Last week I had a relapse at work, crying and unable to really express what was wrong. I stupidly said to to the manager I didnt want to go to work..as struggled to get out of bed. I hadn't felt this way for quite some time. 
I decided to talk to doctor and he gave me some time off. The manager was not happy and said ""it was disappointing"". After continued emails (maybe I shouldn't have answered in hindsight) she said the 2 managament staff had talked and decided to take one work role off me. 
Later on in the week she asked if I would be in for the rest of the week. I was so angry from previous emails and not wanting to be brash I simply said I wont be in but will be back Monday. 
The email that followed that was the worst. Instead of telling them I would not be there apparently I should have asked. They pointed out that they had been lenient with me and I should show more respect and professionalism. The said they have offered support yet I have never taken them up on it. Never did I say anything about struggling at work, sometimes theres no reason for a relapse. I like my work. Life just got on top of me I think. 
I'm just not sure what to do now. How do I go back to work and face them all?

Hi all,

I feel like I've probably suffered depression my whole life but only realised in the last couple of years that that's what it is. I've never ever felt content in life. Even at school I hated almost every subject and struggled to make friends as I was painfully shy and just generally felt unhappy. I am less shy these days however I still feel unhappy a lot of the time and have such little motivation. I called in sick to work today and will probably do the same tomorrow as I'm just so over it and don't want to go in. I find the daily routine of life so tedious it makes me want to cry. I feel like I'd rather just go travelling forever so that everyday is different but I know that's not realistic. I exercise regularly and am eating better lately which I thought would help me feel better but it hasn't really! I feel stuck in a boring rut and don't know how to get out of it. Sometimes I think I would like to re-train and learn a new skill to try a new career and get a better car as it's on the verge of giving up, but I just don't have the money. My partner is against me getting a loan as we have enough outgoings as it is and have a wedding to pay for. So even when I do muster up a bit of enthusiasm and start researching courses I could do I then remember that there's no point me researching it because I can't afford to do it anyway and that just makes me feel worse again like there's no way out of the rut I'm in and will just have to continue with my current routine and job which I'm so bored with. What's the point in living a life you don't want? I'm really at a loss of what to do. I've spoken to a psychologist a couple of times but I always relapse. I'm wondering if it's worth me finally trying antidepressants? I'm worried I'm going to drive my partner away as I'm always so down all the time.

Today I read an interesting article: 'Psychologists find the purpose of depression'.  In summary: 
""""""Several researchers have advanced the argument that depression can serve a possibly positive purpose in the lens of evolution. In some circumstances, it may be yielding of insights & personal meaning.
Depression may be an adaption for analysing complex problems. The physiological symptoms suggest an evolutionary design- to pull us away from normal life so we can focus on understanding & solving underlying problems that triggered.
The meanings people derive from different experiences depends not on the amount that they've suffered but the extent of the reflection -or meaning-making. So logically, if the job of a depressive episode is to figure out what's gone awry, what emotional knots need untangling, what attachment patterns need to be identified, then ADs are an incomplete treatment. (Analogy: analgesics can't heal a broken ankle without a cast) Healing of depression needs not just an alleviation of symptoms but a reworking of psychological patterns. CBT etc may work cos they tap into &accelerate the processes that have already evolved to occur over a longer time frame.
Depression is a space for reflection. A journey into the underworld where the adventurer is to go through the door.. ..immerse in the wound...and exit from the previous life through it.
While disengagement from emotionality characterises depression, engagement with one's inner world looks to be the way out: You exit through the wound.""""""
At first, I found this viewpoint somewhat comforting. It is evolution.  It is human nature. It is natural. It is healthy. I hope it helps some here to make sense of why they are feeling down,& to better overcome it.
But with more thought, for me it is nothing new. I reflected on this long ago & I believe it to be true. It may be possible for some people & some circumstances, eg dealing with & acceptance in grief. Events can't be changed, but we move on.
But what if the triggers are just surviving in day to day life & cannot be changed. We might understand &have no more knots to untangle. No amount of positive thinking or reflection & acceptance can change some circumstances (triggers) that we must continue to deal with in order stay on the rollercoaster of life. It might be a reason that we are never 'cured' of depression& can be prone to recurrent bouts. It could also account for 'treatment resistant depression'that can last for decades.

Reaching 60yo l can reflect on my early life and it is clear that my thousands of buckets l could have filled with my tears is in contrast to the period of post 2009. Why?.
Diagnosed in 2009 with bipolar 2,depression, dysthymia and dwindling anxiety meant the correct medication was prescribed.  From then on it was more a case of fine tuning dosages.
Last week l had the trauma of my youngest daughter leaving my life. She's  24yo and l have been tormented by this development BUT, I  havent shead a tear. I feel it is a reflection of my newfound mental strength. Yes she has come and gone in my life but that fact doesnt mean it comes easy to cope with.
What else could it be?. After much analysis l think acceptance of what life really is has helped.
Life is not what we plan it to be nor wished. As kids we drew rainbows but not rocks. Life will throw stones, rocks, even boulders- without warning. Is our lack of being able to cope due to us expecting a smooth road in life? Or do we know life has hurdles but when they arrive its so devastating we have no learned skills to cope with them?
At school we had no lessons in ""coping with trauma"" or ""breaking up with your partner, how to do it with compassion and care"" or ""depression signs"" etc.. even financial planning isnt taught. All these life challenges are learned the hard way.
Some people can approach such challenges easier than others. So if you are sensitive, had a cruel upbringing, family history of mental illness and so on, you might let your tears become streams. Is it an indicator of your mental strength-lack of it?
I suggest it could be. There is no worse feeling imo. That feeling of devastation, worthlessness, failure and mental collapse- crying. However I've  known some people equally the same but not crying, with filming over their eyes as if deeply sad without tears so I'm  not saying it is the case every time.
If you have had a period of lots of crying, to work closely with your professional mental health expert with medication and therapy. Hopefully you'll  improve and your stream of tears will dry up. Mine did so there is hope that your mental strength will return or develop even late in life.
Accepting life has boulders will prepare yourself for them. Sh*t happens and its out if your control but you can develop strategies to cope better and a mentality that will look at life for what it is and always had been, unpredicable, hurtful but can be wonderful, incredible and more stable

Hi all
I have read all the literature out there about bipolar disorder and i am a little confused. I have been officially diagnosed with bipolar 2....but i don't get depressed?..my symptoms are i get so mentally exhausted from stress to the point it effects my entire body and i end up with huge migraine head aches and absolute physical collapsed from fatigue and a very noticeable dip in my health to the point where it actually shows up on blood tests as an auto immune problem (not kidding i have proof). My point is that i think the doctor has diagnosed me incorrectly OR..can someone please let me know if this is what they experience with there condition? Or should I get another opinion? One more thing i would like to ask..is..when my thoughts race to the end of the world panic i get extremely angry...like really really angry...almost like a defense mechanism kicking in when i have shitty thoughts..which is kinda just as powerful as the bad panic. But..they are both things to have going on...which makes me think..why do i over think EVERY THING...is it to stop myself from drowning or boiling or both. By keeping myself occupied? And why do i constantly blame people for this stuff...not that i ever tell them because i keep it to myself. I sound so rounded at the moment. But this cycles every 3 days....the headaches are every few weeks.. the physical assault is unbearable..medication does nothing..instead of my stuff coming in every 3 days....it drags out over weeeks..at least this way i have some kind of control. I wish it would all go away because i can't really keep going like this....I'm 37...have a wife have children...i used to work...had a job for 7 years in the one place...before that 6 years...now there is no work...anywhere...i have applied for over 147 jobs since January last year..no luck. I no longer know how to talk to people anymore because i have been out of the work force for so long. I never was a social butterfly anyway. How do i fix this? I don't think i can..
Thanks

Hey everyone, 

Not really sure where to start or what to say but here goes...
the last few weeks i have been extremely tired and had no motivation to do anything and i was beginning to feel quite feint, thinking it might be diabetes i went and got some tests due to my background being Maori and my dad and others having diabetes i thought it would be wise.
I explained this to my boss via message which took me forever to press send and then i anxiously awaited a reply, in which he said health comes first just keep in touch which made me calm down a lot. so i have had the past over a week off due to this as well.
Knowing i had to return to the doctors this morning for results i was up majority of the night with anxiety worrying/tossing and turning about my results which then lead to me stressing about work and money etc etc.

Then i heard my mum awake in the kitchen so i crawled out of bed to go talk to her and have a smoke and i explained about my anxiety which i have never mentioned before as i am quite a secretive person and i guess hate to think that i'm dumping my problem on others. she then mentioned to me that i should say something at the doctors when i get my results.
Finally getting to sleep and waking up for the doctors (which was a huge struggle) i went to my appointment with severe anxiety of my results which came back with no diabetes for now but a high chance of me getting them at some point.
after i received them i mentioned my anxiety and she asked a few questions about how i feel like, tired/lethargic, motivation, work etc which all got a high answer on her 1-5 scoring chart so she gave me a referral to see a psychologist because she thinks it definitely is depression and worsening from what i explained.
I feel a lot better knowing i have taken a step to do something about it, but now my fear is in my job, i cannot even bring myself to call or message my boss to explain what is going on or when i will come back to work and then i feel i ""HAVE"" to force myself to go because i am stressing about money and its just a viscous circle that keeps going around that i cannot escape.
I find my only escape from reality and my issues that makes me feel better are video games, i feel i can really escape when playing and i would much rather interact with other gamer's online than face people in reality. it is pretty much the only time i relax and literally don't think about anything at all.

I'm 36 in October, single and struggle with depression, anxiety and BPD. I'm still trying to clear debt and don't think I have anything to offer a make or family. I'm just starting to think maybe it's time to give up hopes of a family and starting to think what are things to plan and aim for if this is the case? Anyone else faced this situation?

Hi, 
I am a 40 year old guy, 3 beautiful kids and I have an amazing wife. Not loving my career right now - considering a change (if I can figure out what I want to do). Often stressed, I tend to binge on alcohol and I suffer from anxiety and depression. I've been on medication for 15 years which helps but the roller coaster of this illness is probably the hardest. I exercise a lot, I eat well and try and be the best person I can be, but this feeling of sadness, being lost and being depressed just creeps back in. No doubt the booze doesn't help, so I will endeavour to once again make changes there. 
 I never really though about a mid-life crisis as I kind of still see myself as young (and I act it), but I'm definitely going through something, and it is affecting my family. So now I need to sort this out...... Adding to the already chaotic life that we live with 3 kids under 6, I need to be strong and helpful to my wife, not another pain for her. She is the rock in our family and I hope one day I can let her know just how much I appreciate everything she does for everyone. 
One thing I'm now going to do is head to a health retreat for 5 days or so and get some perspective. Has anyone else done this? I would prefer Melbourne based. I've read up on a few and love the idea of exercise / good food / talking and tackling mental health / working through over indulgence and addictions / stress / being overwhelmed / psychological health etc. 
 I hope this can be a good next step.... Any thought?
 Matt

Hi, I am An 
 This is not easy for me to get communicate and reach my feeling to people here. First at all I must apologies for my poor English. 
 I don't know what I get to, It's been like a week or more I don't know. I have been sad, insecure, depress and untrusted to people.
 Whenever I playing game or working on design I didn't think anything but when I leave it, I keeps thinking and worries about my relationship matters. I do not have much friend (just one at the moment) I like to make friend with local people to talk in English but those people won't stay long they keep ignore or barely talking with me. 
My family is another story. I been with them like forever I just finally move out last year and when I with them we talking in Vietnamese. I didn't go out or make any friend because they never gave me a break time to make friend. my life was work, home and study. 24/7 is a big circle and it makes me sick. I am a type of person like to out and see how the world running, want to trying and knowing everything (yes I am very open person) 
So go back to friendship, I do go out to know people, I did to use social network I also did try hookup app (I know most people here is not worth to know) but people like just chatting little bit and do not talk again. newest thing here I have know a person on social network we makes friend for long time but never talk (just play game together) then I contact him talking a bit and everything very cool yes like a great conversation but then next day when I login back he is out of my friend list. 
I was unbalance these days, very sad, unhappy and do not wanna do anything when I go to work it is very boring me and I just do not wanna do anything just do something boring to killing time. my workmate did try to cheer me up but it just work like a bit then I get down again. 
My feeling very unstable now sometime high some time low and down I did not upsetting or feel tired. I just dont care and do not want to do anything at all. also I been less sleeping time like 4 or 6 hours only. this Monday I been stay awake until 3am and wake up at 6am.
 I do not interesting to eat anything just eating because hungry and I did eat a bit. 
I did book an appointment to see GP but it take like 20 days later. 
I think I will take a day off tomorrow to sightseeing to cheer me up but I don't know is it make me better. I plan to watch a movie I love a most tmr but I scare a side effect. because I want to watch with my friend.

I have been fighting this disease for almost 10 years and I feel like I can't do it anymore. 
My medication has left me numb. Brain dead. little feeling at all. I can't do anything.  I spend my days sleeping. It's not a life. I don't know what to do..

Hi everyone,
So late last year I was diognosed with bipolar disorder. My medication was changed and life has been improving and generally great.
i found out a few weeks ago that I am pregnant (very unexpected as it has a less than 5% chance of happening) but as a result I have been taken off all my medication I have an appointment with my psychologist next week, but I'm finding everything a huge struggle. I don't sleep, my moods are terrible and my thoughts are dark. As a first time mum I'm terrified as it is, but putting the lack of medication, no sleep and pregnancy symptoms together I am an absolute mess.
Is there anyone who has or is experiencing something like this?
Or anyone with any advise on how to get through the next week before my appointment?
i would really appreciate it.
thank you

Hi everyone,
I've been a long time reader, but haven't posted here for a long time. I am after help, advice or just a few words. Honestly I feel very al one with my issues because I don't know anyone with any mental illness and it's very alienating.
So I've had depression and anxiety since I was 15, diagnosed at 17, then when I was 25 I was diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar type 2. I've been trying to get my own business going, but it's slow obviously, so in the meantime I looked into getting on the disability support payment through Centrelink. It was rejected and I'm now on Newstart allowance (I absolutely loathe being on Centrelink by the way). 
In November I had another relapse which included bouts of violence, anger, mania and severe depression. I'm still not back to what I was earlier last year, but I'm very slowly getting there. So I want to start finding a job part time job again to help me out until I can get back to work on my business. 
So I ask, how did anyone here find a job, or keep one with any mental illness and have your dealings with Centrelink been as discriminating as mine? I've basically been called a liar because I'm a very good actress and put on a brave face in public, when I rarely go out. And one woman from a job support centre actually told me to suck it up.
My psychologist and psychiatrist recommend I only work 10 hours a week, which seem so low I won't ever find a job that's under 20 hours a week. 
Sorry for the long rant! And thanks in advance. 😊

Hi
I have a slightly weird form of depression that I searched for but didn't see much come up about. Anyone else get existential depression? I tend to have long patches where I'm doing fine, and then stumble into existentialism and wonder what the point of it all is. 

I had a weird childhood because I had a perfect memory. Made me have to do things differently because I'd be forced to live with the consequences of my actions forever. 

It also meant that I had limited space for what I'd give my attention to - I really struggled with other children who changed their minds constantly and contradicted themselves daily (I'm friends with Sophie! Now I'm not! Actually we're all a giant group of friends except we hate Alex!) I'd get sick from having to live with all the mismatched data. They weren't even lying! They just changed their minds, and that constantly rolling game was the point of their world. It wasn't mine.

Fortunately I had a son when I was 26, and then became a single mum. He never slept, and was still waking up seven times a night when he was one and a half years old. Turns out they use sleep deprivation as a form of torture because it completely destroys a person. Far from an eidetic memory, I have no memories at all for the first three years of his life.

So now my mind is a much happier place. I can mess things up and forget about it! But I occasionally slip back into wondering what the point of it all is (the What is the meaning of life question I was driven to answer, back when answering it was a genuine possibility). And it makes me find all the small things I do day to day pointless. 

Does anyone know how to stop sliding into big picture thoughts? It feels very similar to meditation. So... how to not meditate?

Hi,
i feel soo bad. This is the 3rd time I get depression first 2 times were 10 years apart and I really didn't know much about depression. Ladg eposiode before this I've was 3 years ago. I was put on medication and started to feel better in 2 weeks.  I'm so scared I will live my life like this. I have 2 daughters and a loving husband . Work wise I have some challenges and want to quit my business which I started a year ago and go back to my career. I have a problem of doubting everything including my dr assurance I will get better but it takes time. Anyone here who had depression lift and how long did it take and how u start to feel better. I can't remember how I got better the last time. Is it one day you wake up and feel better or a gradual thing. I'm desperate to feel better soon. Each day I wake up hoping I'm back to normal and get so disappointed when i''m not. I'm so testy and scared of not getting better

Hi There, 
I feel like I have been living in hell for years now just struggling to get through the days. I feel as though i take 2 steps forward and then 10 steps backwards. I am constantly trying to talk myself into a happy state, to be strong but its all very short lived. I feel like Im a burden to everyone, im restless, unmotivated, tired and just want the world to pause so I can catch up mentally and emotionally. Does anyone have any tips or tricks that helps them calm down. Its getting to the stage I get this pain through my shoulders neck chest and back most days.. i feel so fidgety and so sad all the time. It almost feels like its something more than depression now.. I just feel completely out of control and lost.. I have no idea how to fix it.
 If you have any ideas, advice, please let me know. Thank you.

Hey everyone,
It's been a while since I've posted on the forums. It felt as if I was getting back on track, I wasn't even thinking about suicide any more. That felt like huge progress to me.
I've had a back injury at work at the end of 2015 and it's still not better. Being in pain every day gets the best of me sometimes, but you learn to cope I guess. But recently I was called in for a meeting to explain the options I have at my current workplace. The good thing is, it's part of an agency, but finding work within it is tougher than I thought. My skill set is rather limited and haven't had the chance to study too much due to financial strain. Maybe a quick course here and there, nothing significant enough to get me ahead.
If I can't find a job within 3 months within the agency, then I'll be given a medical redundancy package. I honestly don't want it. It's going to make my life even harder to find a job. There is a major lack of skill improvement in the work place and the ladder to success is closely guarded here.
I have no idea what to do about it. I've been looking every single day, hoping something will pop up which I can apply for. This is stressing me out quite a bit. The bullying and attitude I've been receiving doesn't help either.
I know that I'm trying my best, but sometimes it doesn't feel like enough.
At least I've quit smoking and drinking. So I have that going for me, which is nice.
Hope everyone has a fantastic Friday, if not, I'll hug you all.
Peace & Love

Hello Everyone.
 I am 27 years old and for years I had been mis-diagnosed for 15 years as Schizophrenic, Schizo Affective, Bi Polar until finally, I got the right diagnosis of BPD.

I  find it really hard to relate to people that don't understand what BPD people go through. We really do get misunderstood. My relationships can be intense, Like love interests. There is definetely the fear of being abandoned and for me constant re assurance that I was loved in my previous relationship. I also have extreme trust issues. I have learnt to try not to tell people to much anymore. I hate myself some days, then i think I am great? Struggle with self image and identity all the time its infuriating.
I haven't worked in almost a year, but may be getting a full time position in something I haven't done before. I feel I can do it, but I am also worried that I will be criticised too harshly by co workers, or even mainly by myself.
Please comment BPD community  xx

Im so sick of feeling down all the time like a walking zombie I have days were im so happy I look crazy then other days were I stay naked in bed for days crying not wanting to talk to anyone. I just want help I dont want to have to keep making excuses for going to seek help. I dont want to give up on myself but everyone else has given up on me so maybe its time to just end it.

Hello, I'm new to the online community. I've been suffering depression & anxiety for the past two years since a relationship breakdown (10 years) I'm currently living with a friend she's been a great support but I'm very focused on helping her and her family but have no interest in doing something for me. On the outside I appear fine to others except those extremely close who know I'm not going that well.  I've tried psychological help and medication which I don't feel have helped and would rather try to help myself with other options. So I'm just looking for some advice on where to start. I have times when I spiral into thoughts of panic about my future on a myriad of levels. I am not the person I once was and am not sure how or if I will be again. Today I drink,smoke,rarely socialise,little exercise. I previously was running marathons,gym junkie,social drinker & non smoker..so I thought I'd see if anyone might have some suggestions as to where I begin...thank you for reading

I wasnt sure what to call this thread.. I basically have some questions..
 Sometimes it just hurts to be around people. Like I just want to lay on the floor or go home. There is just something so painful about it sometimes. I have to go to the bathroom and calm down. I don't really understand why this is.. I just feel so sad. For no reason.
Sometimes life just doesn't seem to have much meaning or point. Why do i work? So I can pay the rent and feed myself. Why pay the rent and feed myself? To what end? Like I know that's kind of dramatic and silly, but it's how I feel some times. Life just seems to be this thing to ""get through"".
Are these depression things? Or just my own immaturity?

Hey, so I'm not sure which forum to put this in.. But here goes. I'm 17 weeks pregnant and I just don't know what I am supposed to feel. I don't feel happy or excited but I don't feel sad or dread.. I just feel blank about it. I find the gush around it quite un relatable. I can see in my mind how it's a good thing, I think it's a good thing but I have no feelings about it.  What if I have no feelings towards my baby? I dunno.. I dunno if it's normal but I'm kind of nervous to bring my ambivalence up to my friends or family in case they get the wrong idea. I don't not-want to be pregnant.. But I don't want to be either.. By which I mean there is an absence of want.

I've been officially diagnosed with BP disorder....
 
any tips?
Ps - I got asked today 'are you taking your medication' my answer 'of course I am!!!!' the response --- change of tone.
 
*venting* Why do people ask you if your ok then are not prepared for the answer. Sometimes I think I'm better off lying just to make people happy.

My partner recently ended things with me for the second time. I have been diagnosed with depression already, and I am not coping well at all with this situation. I can't eat, drink or sleep. Every time someone comes in to see me I just cry and cry and can't even speak. I don't want to be alone though. I've begged my family not to go to work just because I'm petrified of being alone. I feel so weak and light headed, I don't have motivation to move from bed to even shower. I feel like I can't do this anymore. I can't do anything at all. I'm scared.

Feel so sick today, just can't fight it today, so tired of it. Made it to work then got unwanted call from family member that just made things worse and triggered of screwed up feelings and anger, now about to break.  Feel so down and just sick of it, don't even want to leave my desk or look at anyone in fear I'll break down again and everyone will see.  Started new medication a couple of weeks back but I'm just feeling worse, so down feels like I have a lump in throat from swallowing trying not to break down. Have used up most of my sick leave so can't really just walk out and go home. Feel so trapped and just thinking why am I doing this, things are so far gone in my life its just so rubbish, but I know there are people worse off and that have really big problems, but I'm running out of strength.  I can't even call a support phone line because I know I'll just break down. I just don't know anymore, what to believe in.

My BPD story began many years ago, in a six month reign of darkness, self harm, medication and abandonment I learnt these things: 
1) I am allowed to have an opinion- For many years, I agreed with everyone's ideas out of fear of loosing friendships or relationships, to me to was not as though I knew I was doing it, it was just ingrained in me that to agree with everyone else if made them happy, and others happiness made me happy.. 
2) Life isn't always about people trying to abandon you - My father left us with I was 3, and left me with major abandonment issues. It took many years to realise that my husband ( Married for 10 years now) wasn't going anywhere, and no matter  how hard I tried to push him he loved me, for me and only wanted me. Even after walking out of our family home twice in a ""episode"" he was still there, helping me.
3) Some people you just shouldn't be around - With my disorder I learnt that I adopt other people's personalities, and opinions, some of these things would actually disagree with my core but out of fear of loosing people I would just try to be like them... It was not until many years later that I actually realised that I do have the right to disagree with people and if they don't like it then they are really not a good person to have in my life. 
4) Please don't tell me who I am - This is linked to the previous point. It again took a long time to realise that I had a voice, I have opinions and it is ok to have these things. I had to relearn and redevelop my own personality, my own opinions and most importantly realise that if I feel down I need to say so... 
 BPD is my label, but it isn't who I am.

I am suffering with crippling loneliness.. After another failed relationship the effects are taking their toll and I have fallen in a hole so deep I don't know how to get out. I am trying to see the silver living and be mindful and grateful as aside from being single I have a blessed life, however the feeling is so strong now that I can't see past it. My mind is constantly plagued with negative thoughts.
Any suggestions how to break out of this funk and actually put ""positive thinking"" into action?

So I've been treated for depression for the last 10 years (I'm 25 now) medications have never done all that much or stopped working eventually.
 I've never thought I had Bipolar but I'm only starting to wonder now. 
My ex partner mentioned about 6 months ago that he thought I had Bipolar because of the frequency/severity of my mood swings but I didn't really pay it any mind until a lady I work with mentioned she thought I have it (she has similar mental problems and so picks up my mood swings better than I do)
 Basically I have major depression with how I would always see it, brief and rare gaps of happiness or feeling normal which would always make me rather energetic and bubbly/ talkative. I've always put this down to it being a snowball effect because I was feeling so good about feeling good! 
When I crash, I crash hard and fast in an instant, there are no warnings or slowly easing back into a depressive state, this lady I work with mentioned that her crashes are more in steps bit by bit. So I'm wondering if there are other people with depression who INSTANTLY drop back down into a depressive state with no triggers or if this could be something else. 
I do notice that I speak and think faster/don't sleep as much when I'm up but this is maybe max a few days and with gaps of anywhere between weeks to months.
 When I'm down it's the usual depression, can't get out of bed, can't get enough sleep, talk and think slower.
I'll be going to the doctors regardless but as I'm sure everybody here is aware that not every GP is specialized in this area so want to see if there are anyone that is on specific Bipolar medications that don't have extreme symptoms that fit the general stereotype.
 
Thanks in advance! :)

I am not that young, after 35. Female. First, I am quiet nice and friendly person, great mum and wife, but those things don't work at all. All my life I tried to do something, be someone, be useful and motivated. I am hard-worker and have very strong willpower. Everything that I did looks like I spent my time for nothing. I started yoga, had so much passion for that. Ended up like a shit, because working on my body more than 2 years I can't do any poses, because I am not flexible enough. Tired to prove that I can do. I tried to write a book, worked hard, spent a lot of money. At the end it wasn't good enough, as editor said. My book is not that bad, some other could be completely stupid, but they are successful, because they are lucky. I can't work on my books anymore, without perfect English knowledge it's useless. (I wasn't born English speaking). My husband saying that I failure too, because he can see that all my work that I started simply unfinished. I can't go further if I feel like nothing works for me. I am good at acting, but my agent said I am not good for that business, because I wasn't born in this country. Only words that I can hear: ""Not good, not enough, not beautiful, not talented, TOO OLD, not Australian"". I have nothing and completely worthless. I feel like an alien, like unwanted piece of puzzle. I feel rejected. I want to learn a personal trainer, but scared I will fail there as well. All my hard work ended up fail, no matter how hard I am working (and I am working very hard. No one need my hard work). I don't have any friends, people truly like successful ones. I stopped believe in people long time ago. I hate social media, they taking me into deeper depression. I can't talk to anyone, because I feel like people don't want to hear about this. My closest and only one friend died because of depression and I don't want to end up like her. I am very fit and sporty, exercising daily, very healthy and to other people I am very happy and positive person . But I am not at all. I don't want to go to psychologist, it won't help. I can't talk about it even with doctor. I am not religious and don't want to be. For myself, I think nothing can help me. Being very productive I had a lot's of ideas to do something, but always fail at the end. It means I am stupid. The reason that I am writing here because my case is simply too hard to understand. I just wanted to write it here, may be I will feel much better. Thank you for reading.

Hi all, I didn't know what to do this afternoon, I was feeling so awful. So this sounded like a better option than losing my mind. My mh journey restarted 2 years ago when I had my first child, I was diagnosed with pnd and anxiety, meds did wonders and I did counselling. During that time my dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and died last august, my husband lost his full time job and I've had issues with mine (I work in mental health, go figure) Pur savings are gone from me taking time off to care for my dad and I have no leave left either. Hubby has had to take work away from home and I'm left working, caring, grieving and everything else by myself. I am so overwhelmed I feel like I'm about to lose my mind. Even though I work in the industry I literally have no idea what to do due to money restraints and working in a small community where everyone knows each other.... I don't know what good this will do but at the very least I got it off my chest. Thank you.

Hi am a 27 year old male and would like to express a little about me,
Well I've got a long history of ups and downs. Goods and bads.giving up hope, quitting, self doubt and ever thinking if I can live the life I know truly want.
Currently an diagnosed with anxiety, social anxiety, depression and ADHD. But deep down there's that darkness pulling me down. I've been doing a lot of research about the habits, feelings and mood swing I always have and have across bipolar 2. Which actually seems perfect for my condition. i understand now why I got a bad sexual desire for sex and women and always seek it. Why I get a feeling like I can achieve anything and feel in touch with the world and money sprees I do when I can not afford it. But there is then dark depression that can kick in and I shut myself out from the world and hide in my cocoon. I've had multiple relationships that have failed due mood swings and cheating, I know cheating is bad, but I crave the thrill of being naughty and the fight is real whether to do it or not.
When I'm in my highs, I try everything possible to achieve my dreams, but end up getting overwhelmed and quit. I currently don't work or study, I try both and end up just quitting. I get over it or I get overwhelmed and think I'm not capable to stick to it. That then leads to a down cycle, where I hate myself, hate life, wish this pain would stop and believe this will be me forever. It's a hard cycle to beat. I do end up beating and follow the same cycle. I never went to the doctors on a low, it would be when I'm good and I'd explain that I'm doing well and can you refill my anti-depressant script please. But at the times I didn't really understand my behaviour patterns, I just thought I was depressed. So it's no ones fault other than miscommunicate and no knowledge. I am seeing my doctor next week to explain everything in detail about this and I see my psychiatrist next month. I feel there's something more than just ""depression"" something lies deep and I always knew, but it's hard to reach out for help and speak about YOU. But I'm ready to fight and overcome my fears, I still have a journey ahead of me. But knowing there's more to me other than the illnesses I have gives me that extra hope and a whole lot of weight off my shoulders.
thanks :)

Gday everyone, 

My names Michael and I'm 36 years old. I thought id try and be proactive and do something about my extreme laziness and find out more about it, and rule in, or out depression/anxiety. 
Just thought id come in here and say hello. I will update this thread with more about myself and to see if anyone else feels the same as I do. 

Todays update: Sunday 29th January; Home alone for the weekend while the partner and kids are away, plan to do a bit of housework and I slept in till 3pm... Feeling extremely guilty and just feel like sleep allows me to escape reality. Wake up... Roll over and snooze... Only reason I'm up is that I promised to have a few things done. (We have a very old house in need of repair and I'm meant to be painting my daughters bedroom)

I feel like when I explain my situation I'm just being a big baby and should just harden up. Unsure if I'm depressed or just plan lazy. OK, i better run, gotta get some painting done. 

Any questions welcome and I will be back to update more about myself.

Hi everyone,
Some of you will recognise me (hello again).
In the last 3.5 months, I've moved interstate, changed job, put my apartment on the market but continue to pay the mortgaged outgoings, advertised for a tenant, pay rent and outgoings interstate, got ripped off by removalists, My car (worth $5,000) cost me $6,000 That was just before christmas. I went to my GP to see if there was a psychologist I could speak to but I ended up in a mental health facility for christmas and new year. I was coping reasonably after that, but then my car broke down and requires at least $1,000 worth of inspection to determine what's wrong. That's sent me into a hole again with a lot of pain and suicidal ideation. I'm staying with my sister at the moment who is looking after me.
My discharge summary from the hospital stay hinted at BPD. After reading a lot about BPD I'm not surprised and it explains a fair bit.
I have found a psychologist since moving and she wants to work through DBT (Dialectic Behavioural Therapy) with me which i'm not against and believe that it will be beneficial.
Does anyone else suffer BPD and would you like to share your experiences and how you cope?
Has anyone been through DBT. Was it group therapy or one on one?
Paul

Hi there,
I've been suffering from a severe bout of depression and the doctor gave me a few weeks off work. The thought of going back makes me sick and panic and I don't have it in me to return. The problem is that I spent almost a decade at university studying and finally got my foot in the door and now I'm filled with dread and extreme guilt at the prospect of having to resign when it took me soo long to get this opportunity. Does anyone know if I can take an extended leave of absence or what longer-term options or possibilities that exist if you work for state govt?
 Thanks.

When I'm at work I'm ok but I work casually so have a lot of fee time.
the last few months if I'm not working all I do is pull the blinds and sleep. I have no motivation to do anything or go anywhere. I live opposite the beach so I know I should be there everyday but I just can't be bothered.
any tips of overcoming a lack of motivation and wanting to sleep???

How does one self beat the dark life of depression? Anxiety and addiction. 
Im a 29 y.o male who lives with depression anxiety addiction and probably psychosis. Sounds horrible to say but thats the reality. shh keep it to yourself ;) haha 
I dont find it comfortable living with any of those 'disorders' its very challenging and at times dibilitating. I am currently out of work and am feeling very sorry for myself. If i was a paraplegic or have some physical issue people would understand. This depression n that - no body knows what your going through. You can try to discribe it to a trusted individual but they still may not fully understand. Pit gets to a point where people are fed up in my life. Its the same old story over and over again. I must say its no walk in the park. 
To give you some insite i basically lost everything. Friends the girlfriend job - the list goes on. With my depression i developed an addictive side which became a full time gig. Anything addictive ive probably been there. Now its a time in my life with alot of my old friends are now getting married, have the house on the hill, kids etc and im still struggling to get out of bed. I often choose not tk. I hate waking up - nothing excites me when in the depths of depression. This whole fuck it additude has been going for to long and its time to break free. Time moves so fast that before we know it lifes finished. Its a scary thought. 
Really dont knkw where im going with all of this but i dunno where lucky now days that people are aware of mentalillness and kind of understand what a pain in the arse it can be. I really hope one day this sarga of addiction (terrible coping stradegy) jail rehabs un employment bad relationships can all come to an end. Going to try CBT hopefully that can get us out of this mess. I wish you all the  best and have a happy life.

I feel very trapped and alone at the moment. 

I was diagnosed with clinical depression when I was 21. After medication and counselling, and I learned some tools that have helped me get by since, without medication. I’m 43 now. 

I spent years of my childhood listening to my parents fighting constantly, sometimes violently. Then my father dying when I was 16. Then I had a motorcycle accident when I was 18 and shattered my humurus and twisting my
collarbone. 

I have lost 75% of the movement in that arm and have varying levels of
constant pain in the shoulder and arm ever since. 
I lost my most recent job 18 months ago under bad circumstances, I live in a small town and it has been impossible
to find another job I suspect in part because my previous employer gives me bad references, despite my having been a hard reliable, punctual and dedicated worker all of my life.

I‘m now back on the family farm with my mother. She is aged with a string of ailments. I spend about half of my time helping her, I cook all her meals, doing the physical chores, despite often being in pain from my shoulder and a compacted disc I now have. I spend all day listening to her complain about how sick she and criticising the way I do things. My brother and sister never help out. Visiting the house maybe twice a year. 

I spend the other half of my time looking for jobs to apply for, rarely getting a response. 

I was also diagnosed with diabetes type 2 and really need to lose weight but find that a struggle, despite eating healthy,
no fried foods and very rarely eat takeaway.

I walk and do physical activity every day. But it never seems to make any difference. 

I tripped yesterday and kicked my toes and now my 4th toe is swollen and partially black
and extremely sore.  Though I was reminded how lucky I am by my mother than I have never experienced true pain.  

Now I find myself 43, stuck at home, no friends, nobody to talk to, I struggle to afford to go to the doctor, no bulk
billing here. I can’t remember the last time someone asked how I was. I’ve
tried to make new friends but I am not very outgoing and my interests are not similar to people I meet. I’m quiet and introspective,
I like music and books and matters of the mind.

I used to be a romantic, I used to believe in magic and dream big dreams. Now I am just lost.

I do understand my problems are trivial compared to the real
problems a lot of people have. It still gets a bit overwhelming some days.

So, here we go again. In to yet another year. Another year that starts like the last one ended. And the one before that. And before that. And continue that another 25+ times. Had another Christmas alone. And another New Year's Eve. My therapist said to try and get my family involved in some form of physical contact ... a hug for instance. But no. They don't want to. So that's that door shut. Again. And they are the only people in my life. I've been writing to another online forum as well as this one, but, it's not doing much good. A lot of same old cliched 'advice' that I have tried to death already. A few that say ""message me if you want to talk"", so I do, and never hear from them again. Not that any are in Australia anyway. The feeling of isolation is just .... it's like I am being choked. Slowly. I called Lifeline yet again, and yet again got the same disinterest. Yay Lifeline ... way to make someone feel even more worthless. It's going to be another year of the same thing. There's no more hope to hold on to. Just like there's nobody who will hold me. Maybe there is some kind of symmetry in that, I don't know. I can't do this on my own, and yet there is nobody who wants to help. There's only so many times you can 'put yourself out there' again. And again. And again. Only so many hobbies you can have. Only so many times you can ignore it, focus on something else and hope that it will happen 'someday when you least expect it'. Because it never does. I'm just expected to shut up and be happy alone. To be happy, lonely. And I just can't do that.

I write this knowing that there are far more people worse off than me - but I can't help wondering what if I was no longer here, the stress would be less for my parents Dad 74 & Mum 68, still living with them, work situation - dead end job where I'm expendable and  devalued and forever worried that my job will end without much notice.  No love life what so ever and no one seeming interested.  Little money so would not be much of a catch anyway.
Forever worried about myself or people around me dying suddenly.  Feeling something is seriously wrong health wise with me but scared to go to doctors to find out.  My only saviour is a gorgeous 4 year old Labrador but Im in constant fear of losing him - got him when I was long term unemployed and he saved my life, I had a purpose, wake up walk the dog, look for work during the day, and in afternoon socialise the dog at the park, lately I haven't been near dog park and miss the interaction with the people but my dog was attacked a couple of times and while okay does get very nervous in the parks now and if I lose him I won't have anything left :(   Ironic hey, a dog that is just as anxious as its owner 
I don't want to talk to family about my issues as I will scare them too much if they knew how I was really feeling.  Im a pretty guarded/ shy person and find it hard to make friends and even then, why would I lump them with my problems, I'm fearful of going back to work also, have a review coming up in the next couple of months and I'm unsure of how that will go.   Have been there 3 years in Feb but don't get the sense that I'm liked.  I'm a very strong willed person who lives by a set of rules that is a mixture of my upbringing and rules that I have made as I have gone along in life.  Lots of people I work with don't have the same thinking or willingness to try and understand me and this puts me on the outside of the group.
I have noticed over the last month or so that my thoughts are causing my sleep to be less and less although when working I don't have much nightly sleep anyway (about 4-5 hours a night).  Lately though its been bad dreams and just a constant state of worry about money that causes disturbances in my sleep.  Some nights I will go to bed and hours later I am still lying there thinking and worrying whats next: illness, car breakdown, loss of job, loss of family, I wish I could just jump out of my head for a while.
Well I've wasted enough of your times, feel free to offer advice

I can't seem to figure out how to shake this feeling. I'm usually down most of the time and when people continue there day not paying attention it makes it worse even though I'm glad they are happy it saddens me and makes me feel neglected and I cry for hours about this

Now I'm not very good at expressing myself so im just gonna start typing and see what happens.
Also if this is posted in the wrong area i apologize 


On the 6th of May 2016, 4 days into a new job working in a warehouse i suffered a left thumb injury. UCL Tear and a bone abrasion.

Essentially my thumb bent a way its not meant too, damaging ligaments and tearing a small chunk of bone off also.

This new job was just after a period of time off work due to my mental health.


I was put onto workcover by the employment agency i was hired through, and it has been one of the most horrible experiences of my life. 

The original diagnosis of my thumb was just extreme swelling which my gp advised me would be gone in 3 days. After a week of no improvement i went back to the doctors and saw a different gp. 

He reffered me to a local hand therapist and my thumb was put into a plastic splint, to keep the joint stable while the ligaments healed.

I was immediately put onto 'light duties' in the employment agencies office, as I technically still had a capacity to work and the doctor/hand therapist where hopeful my thumb would recover with rest.

It didnt. 

My light duties are shortened hours, sitting in a tiny room with a table and a laptop, doing work which they say is used, but nobody has ever even opened the spreadsheet. 

I dont receive my payments unless I do the hours specified each day. 



After 5 months of being in the splint, xrays, an inconclusive ultrasound, an mri and an independent medical examination, i was finally reffered to a surgeon and given an actual diagnosis; UCL tear.


I was given 6 weeks off work fully after surgery, then put back onto light duties.

Its been 3 months now since surgery, and while it 'went well' progress on movement and building strength has been painfully slow. 

Monthly hand therapy appointments are apparently enough, and while they say things are looking good its hard to believe that when i can barely move the joint.



My motivation has hit rock bottom, and some days (like today) I get so anxious i just shut down. The thought of going to work and sitting in that room make me feel sick.

I just feel lost. I've grown to despise anything to do with this place and i know its not helping me. 

Im thinking about asking my gp about a mental health plan again?



Its now been over 9 months and I feel useless



Has anyone else whos been through the workcover nightmare got any advice or help?

Hi All,  
 I've come here for some support as I usually just take this 1 problem at a time,  I've been depressed for over half my life,   And suffered anxiety for the past few years since I became a bit of a recluse due to having severe spinal issues,   I'm in pain 24/7 so my threashold for everything is low. I also have Existential Death Anxiety.  These kind of things deprive me of sleep,  I also have night terrors. 
 I've got so many issues I don't know where to begin,Or where to post.  If there's an edge to be driven to that isn't suicide, Then I think I've reached it.  
 Just some of the things I've had going on
Abused sexually as a child by a family member. I have only just started to pick at this.eg  Told my dad for the first time.  
Arguing and disagreeing about said family members inheritance with my mother after I was cut out of the will.  Mother loans me money from inheritance,  has hounded me ever since.  Coming to grips with the fact my mother is a Narcissist and I've had to go no contact for my sanity.
 Disowned by a best friend of several years,  no contact no reason given.  Was told ""you know what you did""  Was never told what. Mothers family takes their side and spends Christmas with them.  I spent that year feeling more worthless and suicidal.  With anxiety getting worse I decided to move from QLD to NSW to live with dad so we (hubby) could save money to buy a house.  Moving made me breakdown for weeks later
I have now  been told I have bipolar2 disorder, told I've had it most of my life and that it's affected every crazy decision I've ever made,  So this has left me feeling even more depressed and lost as I can no longer trust my own thoughts.  Psychologist feels she has diagnosed me and all will be ok when I take enough meds
One of our 2 Dogs died suddenly in November
Dad has been off work with no income due to a knee injury in December so we are paying our bills and his  I'm on DSP and hubby on carers. 
 On Friday the 10th one of our indoor cats was accidentally let out 
Friday the 13th My 9 year old Dog collapsed of a heart attack and died in my arms.  We rushed him to the vet in vain but he was too gone.  While on the floor saying my goodbyes to my dog, I get a call from the neighbour. Telling  me our missing cat had been mauled to death by his dog 3 days ago. he had left him to rot in the sun and gave him back to us in a garbage bag.  
 I feel like everything  has been pulled from under me 
Where should I go from here?

Hi
Im writing to have a whinge because today Im having a really bad day, Im just so down and depressed, my anxiety is out of control. I have been sick with the flu as well, which isnt helping. I haven't left the house for over a week and when I did it was for a appointment with my GP.
My agoraphobia is really taking a hold of me now, its out of control. My psychiatrist comes back at the end of the week, so hopefully going on the emergency waiting list will get me to see him, as I dont want to go back to Hospital again.
Just wondering if anyones got some ideas that I could try. I haven't even wanted to go on my computer until now...
Thanx
Annie

Hi,
This is my first time on a forum so please be kind. I have suffered depression and anxiety for many years. I have seeked help and spent thousands and I am at a loss. I have two extremely supportive people in my life but they don't seem to understand. My partner who I have been in a long and committed relationship of 8 years is a wonderful man but we are polar opposites. I over think he does not, I over obsess he does not. My mother is beautiful and I love her but she only knows the basics as I am afraid of judgement. I need help and I don't know where to go. I suffer terrible hormonal issues and find doctors don't quite understand how to help me. I just feel I am alone with it all and I am suffering silently yet I know I don't have too. I love and am loved so not all is negative but I feel this unstable feeling is putting immense pressure on the ones I love. Thank you for reading and I hope someone can give some wise words. I really appreciate any help x

Hi everyone
I just wanted to post as I haven't really been feeling like myself lately. I don't feel like I'm full on depressed, but lately I have just been feeling very empty like just nothing is really making me feel good or happy or excited and I don't know why and I don't know what to do about it.. When I see my friends and meet up with people I just don't feel good how I used to. I used to be super excited, but now I just feel like I don't know what we would do I don't know what to say and I don't enjoy myself. It's starting to make me feel a bit anxious because I feel like I'm boring them and I'm starting to not want to see them at all because I'm scared of ruining my friendships with this attitude i have.. but I'm just genuinely finding it difficult to have fun and find things to talk about with everyone even with my closest friends :/
 I'm also having a bit of trouble with work.. I've been working in a retail job for the past 6 months and it's starting to get very repetitive and i don't feel fulfilled and excited when i go there. I don't get that much time off either so all the time I wanted to spend doing exciting with friends and family during my uni holidays has been instead spent in this boring empty store which I know is a part of working but I'm getting tired of trying to make plans with people to do things i actually enjoy and then being told no you have to stay here to do this 3 hour shift because no one else is available. A lot of my close friends have moved away in the past few months and it just would be nice to be able to see them while I have the time before things get too busy and crazy with uni again..
Anyway I really just don't know why I'm feeling this way I'm used to feeling pretty happy and having a lot of fun and I feel like I'm just filled with negativity and negative emotions right now.. I just wish I wasn't feeling this way and wish I knew what to do about it..
Thanks in advance if anyone has any advice or stories they can relate or anything it is much appreciated!! :):)

I have suffered with depression for most of my life, but was only diagnosed a couple of years ago. For as long as I can remember, its been a rough ride.
All through my life, and even after being diagnosed, people tell me to ""cheer up"", ""smile"", or ""be happy"" - as if it is that easy. Being happy seems a big ask at the moment. I'm not even sure what that would feel like.
Lately I have been asking myself - is it necessary to be happy, or is it enough not to be miserable - at least not all of the time?
I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this, and how you cope/react to being told to ""cheer up"".

Just curious if anyone has gone a substantial period of time without hugs, how does/did it effect your depression and self esteem. My last hug was seven years ago, sometimes I feel like that is all I am missing from life. I feel like I am a friendly, outgoing and reasonably confidant guy. I just can't convince someone to hug me.
I would really appreciate any feedback from someone in a similar situation.

Hi all,
Apologies if this post is a bit muddled, I find it hard to explain myself a lot of the time recently.
I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and have had both since I hit puberty, maybe even a bit before.
I had a dysfunctional childhood with a bit of trauma sprinkled in there, a troubled adolescence, and even though I have what most would consider a successful life i.e married, new house, new car, good job that I'm moving up in, etc I feel like a complete fraud because I don't even know how I've managed to do all of this, I feel so fractured all the time I don't even know how to explain it.
I have been to a few psychs throughout my life none of which I have felt have truly understood what I am trying to explain to them. They'll ask a question and I'll answer and then they'll repeat back to me to make sure they've understood but what they repeat isn't what I've said and even if I try explain it seems to get nowhere.
The therapy has helped to some degree for sure, but I feel I may have been diagnosed with GAD and depression as that's what they usually diagnose, and they haven't understood the full picture.
From the research I have done, I believe I may have bipolar, probably bipolar 2, however when I mentioned this to my psych she dismissed it. Probably thought I was exaggerating? Who knows.
I have gone through every disorder that may even slightly resemble how I feel and narrowed it down to the ones that overlap and that I have the most symptoms of, and have got to a psych and shown her what my research has come to and she didn't take much notice of it at all, at least from what I could see.
i feel at a bit of a loss because I don't have the energy or time or money to keep going to a psych or finding a new psych. I work in a demanding industry and time off is very limited, and with all the other stuff in my life I feel like I don't have the time to contact any try fix these problems and get no results.
I now have digestive issues, sleep issues, I've developed severe OCD and social anxiety in the last 2-3 years and my arachnophobia has become so intense it's a problem. 
I don't feel like myself, but then I don't even know who ""myself"" is. I feel like I lost my identity long ago.
Can anyone with bipolar 1 or 2 possibly give me some insight? Or does it sound like I was correctly diagnosed as GAD and depression?
I just don't know what's wrong with me or how to fix it :(

Hello all, I have recently joined. Thanks for sharing your stories. 
The last year has been extremely difficult for me and I find myself 
struggling to get through my days. Some days are good and others not so 
much. I feel down, and then begin to worry that something isn't right. 
That worry has become excessive and it haunts me most days. It's as 
though I am not me anymore. Thoughts of worry and sadness keep recycling
in my head and often I try to rationalize out of them but find that 
they return. I wish that I could just go back to being me, driven, 
motivated, and happy.
 I am not sure where everything went pear-shaped but at 33 I find 
that my life has not turned out very well with major career setbacks, 
job insecurity, and discontent with my social relations. I have not 
turned to medication yet as I am afraid of the side-effects and want to 
give myself more time to get better.

Hi I'm new to all this but I figured Letting it out is better than keeping it in, so here goes. Ive watched my mum go through alot of medical issues over the last 15 or so years and has been a tough ride and she has always managed to pull through but after the last hospital visit the doctors informed us that there is nothing else they can do for her, she wants to keep fighting like she always has but I'm afraid eventually her life will be lost. I'm struggling to come to terms that I will loose my mum, I've lost a lot of people close to me over the years but it's my mum and she is everything, it's breaking my heart, I was quite depressed before this and  scared that it's gonna break me. I've never spoken to anyone outside of friends and family cause I feel embarrassed to let out all my emotions. thanks for listening

Well my story begins 22 years ago when I ran away from home at the age of just 14 years old. I was from the Mid North Coast and jumped on a bus to Sydney. I had never been there before. So when I got there it was dark, nearing the middle of the night and I was scared. 
From them until approx. 4 months ago I was homeless when I found my younger sister and mum through Facebook of all places. My sister invited me to live with her, my future brother in law and 2 young nieces (8 months and 4 years old). I was an Uncle and never knew it until we began talking before moving back up to the Mid North Coast.
A week after moving back up to the Mid North Coast and moving in with my sister and her family I had to go to the doctors to have some tests done which is what I was about to have done in Sydney. Within a matter of days it came back that I have Stage 4 Cancer. It's aggressive and no option of treatment as they feel it would be pointless.
I had to break this to my mum and sister. That was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. My mums first words after being told what the doctors said was 'I just got my son back and now he is going to die on me'. This broke my heart. My sister held her emotions well as her partner was at work. She messaged him and told him the news. He decided to come home so she went and picked him up. They took a long time and I could see when she walked in the door that she had been crying. She broke down as soon as she got with her partner. 
Right now I am on some really strong medications to control the pain as it is really bad at times. And sometimes I can't even get to sleep. I find it difficult talking to my mother or sister about my feelings and what is going on in my head. They want to know so they can help, but it's hard to tell them. And I just don't know how to do it.
Now the worst thing is the oncology unit at the local hospital gave me a time frame of roughly how long I have left. And I haven't told them that. And I really don't know how to or even if I should. Because it's not a massive time.
We are trying to spend as much time together doing things and getting lots of photos so there is some good memories before I pass. But with the pain I have been sleeping a lot and we haven't been able to do much lately. I feel that I am a burden on them, even though they say I'm not. I can't help how I feel.
Now, do I tell them the truth about what I know or do I not. My counselor thinks I shouldn't tell them. But to me that's lying.

I have posted on BB previously but truly never seem to know what my real problems are. I am staying temporarily with an adult son (27) and his gf. They do not understand MI despite his gf on AD and self medicating with lots of alcohol every night. I have nowhere else to go at the moment and feel trapped. I have had 4 pshycologists appts and just cry and get of the track when there plus she gives me another supplement each visit. I am on AD. I have a long history of trauma being raised in a home with a violent alcoholic father and a people pleasing mother whom are both deceased though suicide. I cared for my sick father for 2 yrs and he took his life while i was in the house. I did not get any counselling at the time and must of been living in denial of that truama, hence my older sibling blamed me for his death. We have been esstranged for 7 yrs now and i feel the pain everyday of losing my family despite the dysfunction i lived with all my life. I lived in an isolated rural area up until Sept last year and came to the this city area to get help for my MI as i was falling to pieces rapidly and not knowing what was really going on with MI.. I have been diagnosed with PTSD and dysthymia. I am also severly hearing impaird from infancy and this has been difficult in many ways through life with education and just general understanding. I got hear aids 5 yrs ago so people think i can just hear now like eryone else..i cant! I still get lost with conversation and have to be looking at peoples faces..which brings me to the next thing..i have relied on facial expression all my life and often i misread and think people are angry with me. My pshyc said i will not stop feeling anxious and depressed until i settle..i cry everyday and blame mysekf for all the losses in my life and wonder why i keep going. I have no job and my pshcartrist said that i would not likely get one because of my MI and my age. I made a decision last night to drive to my old home to see my dog that i miss so much and my ex partner who still does not no he is an ex. Yes messy and now today im thinking i made the wrong decisiin as atnight time i always feel a lot better and mornings are back to the lows of depression. I have contacted many organisations for help and come to dead ends. I get so tired of having to go over the same stuff to get help. I just want some peace from my own head and why does depression play cruel games?

I guess I just needed a place to just put down all my thoughts anonymously...
I'm not sure if I do or don't have depression but I've felt so lost and also a bit lonely lately. 
As a student who recently completed my HSC, I had really struggles to manage my stress, and on top of that, during that period, my girlfriend and I split, as well as some group drama because I was quite unhappy about the way they treated me and I took a bit of a hiatus. It wasn't abuse or anything, just more so feeling like the black sheep of the group, where my group had about 10 people, and there seemed to be little sub groups that I was never a part of which made me feel a bit lost. 
Finishing the HSC took quite some weight off my shoulders, and me and my ex girlfriend ended up getting back together because I really do like her. But now that the craziness of HSC has subsided, I still find myself lost and alone - more so as of the new year than ever. 
Me and my group has pretty much cut off all communication, and I'm quite happy to see them having a good time with each other and what not, but I still can't help but feel really left out. Granted I'm not a perfect human being or what not, but I'm still part of the group, except they don't include me in things. 
My girlfriend on the other hand... Am I clingy which in turn drives me to feeling this loneliness and no sense of direction? I'm not to sure but its just kind of weird when she always claims she never has time for me, but then turns around and goes out with her friends or what not. I feel as if I'm a plan B, or like I'm the spare tire in the back of the car that she doesn't necessarily need, but still wants so she feels secure. Sometimes she just gets really moody and lashes at me like I'm a punching bag, but I just take it because at the end of the day, I know that she loves me and I love her. 
To add to that, I've been struggling really hard to find jobs that I guess contributes to the feeling of being lost. I wouldn't say I'm the best candidate for many jobs, but I feel as though the things I've done and achieved should get me somewhere.
Maybe I just feel underappreciated?

 I'm still %99 sure I'm sick and that's why I'm depressed and not the other way around. The doctors arnt looking deep enough. But yes I probably am depressed and anxious too. I knowing not normal to be convinced you are going to die soon. I know it's not normal.to despise yourself. But I do. I am piece of shit. The only good thing I have ever done is brought two perfect little angels into the world. That's probably just the depression talking. I don't want to die. I want to see my.girls grow up. I feel terrible for my poor wife who has to put up with me. I don't want to be who I am.

Hi I'm 20 years old and need some advice. I often get patches where all I want to do Is sleep all day and I just feel so lonely and upset. Little things trigger patches like this, one moment I'm fine then the next out of no where I just feel so hopeless and tired. I never speak to anyone about it because I feel embarrassed, Iv told me boyfriend and mum on some occasions but they don't seem to care. I have been diagnosed with anxiety a few years ago but have never been back to the doctors for depression as I feel they can't help and I also don't think I'm as extreme as most people so I'm wasting their time. I push my family and friends away, when I get these patches I start to ignore my boyfriend and don't want to speak to him about it which I know isn't good but I just can't speak to anyone about it, so I'm hoping someone can speak to me and give some advice. I hate feeling like this it's so draining one moment I'm fine then the next moment I just feel so low and I hate it. just hope someone can relate or help me out because I just want to feel normal again

Im new to this for forum thing. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have been on since I was in high school. Lately I have been finding it hard to fall asleep because as soon as I go to bed all these thoughts and feelings just drown out any chance of sleep then morning comes and I don't want to leave my bed. I fake being happy all day to the family and hubby as best as I can and don't really have any close friends or family who understand or that I can talk to. They just put it down to a bad day. But every night my husbands asleep and I lay there and cry until I'm so tired I don't remember falling asleep. Usually when the sun rises I dose. I don't know why I'm feeling like this all the time again. Why aren't my meds working anymore. What's wrong with me. I hate this and I'm hating life. I just want to give up and disappear. Why can't i just be happy. I don't what to be me anymore. Its getting harder to fake it, harder to care, harder to do life anymore. I wish I hard someone to talk too. I don't want the sadness anymore. Life is too hard. What did I do wrong. I feel myself slipping and I don't know if I'm strong enough to stop myself or pick myself back up. I'm just so tired. I just needed to get this out of my head.

I'm starting a new job in a few weeks and I have to fill in a Pre-Employment Health Assessment form. On it it has a health questionnaire that outright asks if I currently have or have ever had depression or any other mental illness. Do I have to answer truthfully, and, if not, is it better if I do not disclose my depression at all.

Depression for me is an eerie silence in my soul, everything is uneasy in my body. I don't feel any other emotion other than sadness,  but mostly it's just a numbness, that infects every aspect of my life, I am losing hope that I can get through this on my own, I have been trying for years! Although I am taking antidepressants nothing is getting any easier it's actually getting so much worse. I literally have no desire for anything. Can I be helped?

Hi all,
I'm new to the forums, but everything felt like it was a bit too much today and I think I need to get some things off my chest, and see if anyone has any advice to offer.
I'm 23 years old, and for about the last year I've been working in a law firm full-time. . I've been maintaining a GPA of 6.6, and I've really worked hard at my uni studies. I thought when I got this job that it was everything I'd been working towards.
Working in a law firm used to be everything I wanted. I now believe I'd rather do anything but. I know that my law degree will help me in other areas, and I would still like to become a solicitor and perhaps work in government, I just don't want to work in a firm. I hate the culture at my workplace. But currently, I can't see any way out of my situation. With the number of law graduates there are every year, I know I should be grateful to have a job in this field but I find myself wishing something would happen to me on the way to work every morning, so I don't have to go. It's the disorganised workplace, a high workload, and the feeling that I have spent years of my life studying something I don't enjoy in practice. 
Every day feels like another challenge to face. Get up, go to work, come home, cook, study, sleep, repeat. I'm so scared of this coming year. I'm only doing one subject over Christmas, and in order to finish my degree this year I need to do three or four. I'm already struggling right now with how I feel just doing one. I want to get this study over and done with but I'm afraid I'm going to have a breakdown if I keep pushing at this pace. 
 My partner of four years works night shift, and although before I used to love the time to study, I now find myself in tears Sunday night knowing I won't see him until the weekend. I can't stand the loneliness. 
I feel like I'm sinking into depression again (I had a bout in my teens) and I'm desperate not to. I know that it's mainly my job and my partner's work hours, but I feel as though I can't change either of them. We have a mortgage, and I can't just quit. Although things have been rocky in our relationship lately as well, I can't just quit that either, because I know the legal costs and problems it would cause (he bought most of the money to the relationship and some things he has said while fighting make me believe he would make it hard) and that it would likely make things worse. 

I don't know what to do. If anyone has advice, it would be greatly appreciated.

hello everyone

 My name is SJ,I'm 28,I'm single and I'm an overseas trained physio.I come from the middle east and I'm new to this forum.

I like to share my life  story since I moved to Australia and how it affected my mental health with you guys.



3 years ago I moved to Australia where most people with medical/para-medical
professional backgrounds(similar to mine) have to go through many many strict,costly,hard and at times painful
filters to be able to work independently in Australia,and physiotherapy is not
an exception.one of the worst feelings in life is moving to a country and not
being able to work(not having your qualification acknowledged)although you are competent enough.
anyways,I started work(supervised work under limited terms)shortly after I got a work visa(I was
sponsored by my employer,which gave them a chance to abuse me even more)shortly
after I arrived,I was then severely abused and neglected at work and I had to change
my job twice in one year.
not hard to imagine,the severe pressures of getting through my professional registration
process,the many problems I faced at work,the cultural shock and difficulties
of settling down in a new country(Australia was the first country after my
hometown that I've lived in)as well as the huge sudden change of my life course:
being alone and all on my own(back in my hometown,I had a huge network of
close friends with whom I used to hang out all the time,whereas in Australia
it's been very hard for me to make new like-minded friends,or have such deep
and real connection with people as I used to have)knocked me down after 1.5
years of non-stop struggle with severe depression,up to a point where I had to be hospitalized for a while.
my whole life was shattered and dark, without the slightest ray of hope for months after this incidence,I had come into this wonderful land in  search of a brighter future like many people do,but I was defeated and broken in a way I'd never could have
imagined.I experienced the hardest most painful moments of my life for few months,until I gradually started to recover and
began to get back on my feet.my family was very supportive of me during this
time,though my breakdown came as a shock to them as well.
long story short,I successfully finished my registration process very recently and I'm very proud of myself.
and I've come into terms with myself about my mental and emotional health status,somehow I had to convince myself that the the life I had
before,is gone.

Hi all,
3 weeks ago today I was in an ambulance for the third time in 2 months as the result of my illness (es). Today at the forefront of my mind is something that helps me. A friend said long ago: ""I'm not where I want to be; I'm a million miles from where I thought I'd be, but I'm so grateful I'm not where I used to be"".

Hi guys, Basically i was out of work last year for 6 months. I was on welfare benefits struggling to find work and hating it. I was accepted for a HR trainee ship in November and thought i loved it.. until now. This role is for one person yet there are two of us sharing it, i constantly come into work and have nothing to do for most of the day. The girl i share this role with is not very good at it and i think that is why they thought they should hire someone else to help. The past two weeks have been a struggle, my anxiety is through the roof and i am having small panic attacks almost everyday. The kind where your chest tightens up, you cannot take a deep breath no matter how hard you try, and all you want to do is cry to let all the pain out. To be honest, HR is definitely not what i want to be doing. I am expected to be holding interviews at some point and the thought of that terrifies me. I was desperate to find work I was sick of being on welfare and i just wanted to work like a normal 22 year old. I know I jumped into this role without truly thinking about it and now i am basically stuck and unsure of what to do. I am scared to quit and go back onto benefits because I do not know what i will do with myself if i did but the anxiety is getting to the point where i am resenting everyone i work with and hating everyone and everything. What the hell do i do?

Hi I'm Ana,
I'm embarrassed to say that I'm severely depressed. I've always prided myself on being strong and externally tough however inside I'm falling apart. My family tell me I should be happy: I'm 28 and I was promoted to a management position 10 months ago at work and I received an offer into a prestigious art degree.  I've had to defer my study until 2018 for financial reasons but overall I should be happy but I'm not and I don't know why I feel this way and what to do? I've had depression all my life and it's been manageable with medication. I haven't seen a psychiatrist for over two years and might consider seeing one again. I don't know any good ones in Sydney so any recommendations would be good. Right now is not a good time for me to fall off the rails - however I feel like it's about to happen when all the pieces in my life are falling into place! 
I feel completely unmotivated. Getting out of bed is a struggle and dealing with my passive aggressive (turned slightly aggressive) supervisor everyday is starting to gnarl at my soul. I don't want to clean or contribute to my family life. I feel like a shell really.  
My spiral down began when I started to show my art publicly and it was televised a year ago (after many years of hiding it due to the bullying in high school for it) and I've been receiving a lot of attention for it and it's open doors for me - doors I would never had dreamt would be open. However I under estimated the affect it would have on friends and family and the jealousy involved. I've had to unfollow/delete/block friends and family who were very negative towards me and I still don't feel happy. I feel alone - friends don't want to hang out as often because they don't want to hear my stories or what I've been up to in the art world and family are acting indifferent. It's a terrible place to be and completely different from a year ago. The cyber bullying from strangers, friends and family has taken it's toll on me to the point where I rarely log on to see anything online except reply to my emails. I've lost faith in people and that upsets me. My situation sounds so silly and the sadness of it is that's true. I feel annoyed, angry, disappointed and frustrated and at times wished I had never pursued my love for art or made it public. 
I need help and I'm reaching out. Any advice, understanding or help would be appreciated. 
xAna

Hello, I am new to the forum, I have had a bleeding and painful tumour on my uterus for the last four months. I am now on the public health system awaiting consultation  then a hysterectomy. 
I feel i have underlying depression and my medical condition, and have been feeling hopeless , sad and down for this whole time. I work full time , had been booked in privately for surgery and got knocked back by my health insurer. I am constantly worried at work about everything, and bleeding through my pants. I am on medication which is stemming the bleeding but the last couple of days it isnt really working. I just want this tumour out as I am unwell, trying to fulfill my duties as work, trying to maintain a marriage and friendships and family commitments. I am feeling down, sad and at times unable to cope. 
Any advice to get back to my happy self ?

Hello,
Just looking to voice my thoughts and be heard. Sorry, I'm going to be talking in analogy.
For a while in 2016, I was in a super bad place where everything was so foggy, I could only see the here and now, and only one option seemed available to me. The more I fought it, the more the fog seemed to close in. So I stopped fighting and let the fog slowly, painfully, thin until I could see just a little bit further.
I now find myself being able to see a fair way ahead. I'm not just trapped in the now.
It sounds hopeful. But all I see, stretching out, is a damn long path through the trees into more fog, way out ahead. It is hardly comforting, once the house falls around you and you're still alive, to look around and realise you have to clean up the mess and rebuild the house with nothing but your already broken hands.
And if you do it badly, it'll just fall down all over again, as it has done before.
James is tired.

Hi everyone.
Ive suffered from depression and anxiety for the better part of 15 years now, I've been through good and bad patches, and seem to have found a way of how to deal with it and live with it for the most part,  But I've been through some very bad times since 2008, that was the year my mother died, without me ever being fully made aware of how ill she was, my parents didn't want me to worry because they knew of my illness, they told everybody in my family that I was not to know, but as a result of not knowing what was going on, I didn't get to spend a lot of time with her as I live interstate, and when I was made aware of how sick she was, I rushed home to see her, but before I got there she became unconscious and passed away the next day, I don't seem to be able to get over that I wasn't told and should have been there more, my father then had a severe stroke less than 12 months later, resulting in him needing to go into care which we did not want to do, he was such an active man, up at dawn, not inside until dark, and now he was pretty much permanently inside, which I know he hated, he managed to stay with us for another six years before another stroke took him from us away in February last year, I have since found out that my sister, my one and only sibling who was his power-of-attorney during the last six years literally drained every cent he had, including selling his home to herself very cheaply,  so when he passed away not only was he broke, he owed money,  I tried to work out things with her before I finally had to go and seek legal advice, I've now been in a legal battle with her since March last year, and we actually have all the proof that she has miss appropriated funds, and done the wrong thing, but because of how the power of attorney works, I may not be able to get her to have to pay it back, I feel like this is going to be another thing I have let my parents down with, And I feel absolutely betrayed that my sister could do such a thing, my parents estate wasn't worth a fortune, but she made sure that I was going to get nothing from it, my solicitor has said that the cost of chasing what is left, would probably be outweighed by how much it would cost, and it is very close to the stage of where we might have to Give up,  and in my view that means she's won and got away with it, So how do you live and get on with your life when someone has done something so blatantly wrong? and you may not be able to do a thing about it?

Hi.
I dont know if I have depression or what.
I am due to return to work in 2 weeks and feel anxious. I've been on carers leave, looking after my 92 YO father who lives alone and am the only surviving family member.
I lost mum in March 2016 and her brother (my father figure) 3 weeks later. Anyway I find it really hard to talk to anybody about this as I'm likely to burst into tears.
I think starting work again will be kind of OK but maybe there is some way I can ease into it....will be meeting with my boss next wee. I work for the NSW public service. I mean work might be a good distraction.
But some days I feel such anger inside......I dont want to hurt anybody or myself by the way. But this anger/rage leads me to be impatient, sarcastic and probably a rotten person. Its really hard to write how I feel.
I'm taking a small amount of medication daily just to get through the days. But I also try to walk most days, about 35 min and in that time I feel like I'm on a different plane... more relaxed and can see things clearer.
I dont have many friends any more......my choice but I have all the time for my 2 young adult children. Late last year I saw my doc and was a blubbering mess, she then ordered me off work for 2 weeks saying I had anxiety and something else (I forgot).
Summing up:
I feel:
Angry deep down
Tearful deep down
Insecure and confused
I just dont know whats wrong with me. I spoke to a counsellor for a few sessions but didnt find that of any benefit.

First time reader, first time poster.  A few years back my dad got was diagnosed with a progressive neurological disease.  12 months ago, I took 7 months off work to be his primary carer. He lost his mind. I lost my dad.  2 months ago, my mom was hospitalised.  She's still there, but they don't know what's wrong.  Cancer is the primary suspect, but unable to verify as the test to confirm could kill her.  Prognosis, 30 to 60 days.  I might lose her too - it's inevitable but difficult to accept.  I have a partner - for several years now.  The last 12 months have placed a lot of stress on the relationship, but we've had issues long before this.  I want to end it, as I don't have the mental and emotional capacity to deal with a relationship right now.  But I'm afraid to hurt her.  The last partner I broke up with, threatened to end her life.  She didn't, but had to go through counselling for a while.  This was decades ago, but I still feel guilty and responsible for causing her pain. 
I grew up like most people thinking that we get what we deserve. Not true. We get what we get.  Our idea of fair is insignificant to the course life decides to take.  There's no right or wrong, good or bad, fair or unfair, there's only what is and what isn't.  This isn't an opinion, it's an observation. All we can do is watch and hope the ups are more than the downs, and downs don't break us.  I'm not depressed, I'm lost and conflicted. Knowing that a major life changing event is out of your control is like watching a car crash in slow motion.  You can see what's about to happen but can't stop it.  I would like to think everything happens for a ""reason"", they do, but not for our reasons.  Interplay of cause and effect between millions upon millions of seemingly unrelated variables.  It was never a crash, but a controlled and calculated event.  My life feels like a train wreck in progress right now.  Pieces flying through the air in slow motion, with more damage to come.  All I can do is wait for it finish, pick up the pieces, and take the bus instead.

There is no depression amongst remote uncontacted peoples, nor is there amongst wild animals. Put a lion in a cage at the zoo,  though, and he'll exhibit signs of anxiety. Put a sow (pig) in a farrowing crate and she'll experience a level of depression few here can imagine.

That's what happens when you put an animal in an unnatural environment. We're animals too and civilization is not our natural environment. Our cage is bigger, but it's there for anyone who knows what to look for.

I'm sick of it. No matter what I do, that cage will always be there. The masses will pretend it's not. I will remain miserable because freedom is dead. Forever.

It's a morbid system that demands we toil our lives away just for the scraps it takes to maintain existence. It's not worth the effort. Never will be.

I am unemployed. My unpopular perception of reality is causing tension between myself and my JobActive provider. The pressure is on now that I'm on stream C. I just know they're going to coerce me into using unethical means to apply for unethical jobs. That corrupt work for the dole scam is just around the corner too. I cannot, in good conscience, play into this system. It's an evil monster that needs to be starved to death.

Things are so bad with my JA provider that I, on their advice, had to obtain a medical exemption to get away from them. It expires in a couple of weeks and I have no idea if I can bring myself to go back there.

The doctor, unsurprisingly, was reluctant to give me a certificate over something so stupid. I'd feel uncomfortable returning so soon to tell him the details I left out of my story. Given that my goals are incompatible with the goals society has imposed on me, I don't see the point anyway.

That there is the problem - society has imposed its own goals on me. Those goals are wrong for me. All the ""treatment"" options have those same goals. I'm done playing their game. It's all stick and no carrot.

I don't want to be ""normal"". Most normal people are idiots, drones, pursuing a pointless cause. I want to be me, without the pressure to do society's bidding.

What am I to do? Even if the problem was solvable, I simply don't have the time left.

I don't even have it that bad. It's just that we all deserve better and I'm sick of pretending otherwise.
PS. This forum has some serious accessibility issues.

A couple of days ago someone gave me a postcard of an English hedge maze taken from above. It occurred to me that this was a symbolic start to my new year. When you are in a maze all you can do is wander around looking for landmarks to find your way out. No doubt my year will see plenty of false starts, and no doubt I will spend plenty of time agonising over my loss of way, but I am hoping that there will be a bit of progress too, and that sometimes I can sit on the seats provided and reflect on life. I wonder whether anyone else thinks of their mental health journey in terms of a maze. It is alive, it is a constant puzzle, and there are any number of directions to try.
Maybe you don't identify with me at all - but I can still identify with you. Best wishes for your new year however you see it.

Hello, I am new to this forum so I'm not 100% sure what I'm seeking.
 I am supposed to be moving from Victoria to NSW in the start of February, -and while I've already moved from Western Australia to Victoria I'm finding the whole process impossible. I can't get motivated to pack, clean, organise, make calls, instead I just end up feeling really down and anxious about not doing these things. I usually have a 'just do it' attitude about most things, but I'm finding this really hard, it's making me isolate myself from everyone. 
 
Does anyone have any tips on how to start with this sort of huge project? Or how to push through this barrier of depression/anxiety? 
 
Thank you.

Hi
Im 36 years old and was recently fired from my workplace due to failure of health for depression and anxiety.I was constantly being laughed and mocked by over 100 employees including 4 supervisors.I raised it several times but they wanted it in writing and i didnt want to get people fired.Subsequently i wanted to be moved to a different area of the company,in which HR advised there were no positions available.I ended up loosing my job,and have spent the last 2 years unemployed and sitting at home everyday looking after my 2 year old daughter,while my wife goes to work.I feel like a failure to my family.I dont have the confidence to return to work,and spend most days depressed or anxious about the future.I dont know what to do,i feel alone and just floating through life waiting to get old.I am worried i will bring up my daughter badly due to always being upset and frustrated.It was made even worse by finding out my colleagues were calling me a liar,and telling management i was a liar.I ended up recording 40 mins of hidden conversations about me on my phone in a office,and finding out management wanted me gone due to being a liability and possible cause for suicide in which they wanted no part of.My physologist has said to try other employment but i feel sick thinking about it.I thought of starting my own business as i enjoy selling secondhand stuff on ebay,in which im quiet succesfull,and feel i have a gift for selling.I feel its the only thing im good at,but dont know what to do.I would not wish the past 2 years on my worst enemy,and i sometimes wish it was all just a bad dream.

So you're fed up?. You might have had depression for years. Sometimes you want to give up right?. We all know the feeling.
But other times we are functioning OK, good even and we don't know why. That means it has an underlying lack of predictability to it. The mental health professionals know a lot but there are huge gaps in overall knowledge about depression. There is lack of commonality or we'd all read the same book to read up about ourselves.
So, that moment you are fed up...you decide to ""fight it"". Whatever it takes. You push yourself really hard. But I suggest, based on what I've read and subsequently my own practicing of such readings, it isn't the way to go. Ever shadow boxed? You'll never win against an invisable opponent!
But you might be able to corral it, corner it so you can live life better, not ideal perhaps but limiting the effects on depression should be your aim.
The moment I read an article about 3 years ago that said "" one should allow depressive cycles to run their course not try to hurry up the process"" I knew I'd been on the wrong track. Over many years I'd had many mental challenges, family, workplace discrimination etc and I fought the maximum within my power so I thought ""I can lick this""... No I couldn't and such daily determination might be commendable but that doesn't mean its effective.
It takes more wisdom. Unfortunately some mental illnesses have symptoms that result in fast thoughts and actions that hide our wisdom. With effective medication and the right dosage our thought processes often slow down and that, in my case resulted in making wiser decisions. The intelligence was always there albeit with a manic blanket covering.
Be real. If you are bed ridden then unless you wet the bed you must attend the toilet right? Logical. So you can also rise from bed to greet your carer after a hard days work. At times prepare a brew. Never extend your symptoms. It won't help you and your carer doesn't deserve it.
Spiritual peace. For me it was a crutial element in my recovery. I found Maharaji- and his videos "" sunset"" and ""the perfect instrument"" google them. It isn't religion, its a place you can go that provides peace. In time you'll listen daily because of his logic.
Measured determination works. But nothing works better in my opinion as does 
Proper diagnosis
Appropriate medication
Best dosage
Letting cycles run their course
Being realistic
Relaxation
And not wasting effort striking the shadow boxer.

Hello,
This is my first post. I am away from home for two weeks and staying with my husband who is working in Melbourne. I usually really enjoy these trips away as it gives me fresh places to get inspired by to write. I've been here since Thursday and am feeling increasingly depressed. Actually, I think I've been low for a couple of weeks with a small hypomanic episode just before Christmas. 

To compound things our son and his fiancé had a baby girl a month ago and though we live just ten minutes apart from each other my hubby and I have only been able to see our granddaughter a few times. Both sets of families have been in different states, so it's logistical but it's been hard. I feel like life has taken such a dramatic turn in the past year, with being confirmed with Bipolar 2, generalised anxiety and panic disorder, the new family dynamics and also our 18 year old son diagnosed with Inattentive ADD and social anxiety. It's been a rough ride to be truthful and I just feel tired and lonely. I did the online depression test just before and it came up with 31, apparently quite high. 

I have been walking at least 10,000 steps a day, eating healthy food, drinking water, trying to stay optimistic. I'm just flat and hope that it will pass. I'm also supposed to be organising to see my father's family for the first time in 27 years, and it's feeling very overwhelming. In fact, I think when I realised that it had been that long I noticed a shift in my mood levels. 

I'm still taking my medication and trying to maintain some form of structure but just feeling unsure how to get through the current shift. Thanks for listening.

Do you ever feel like you can't reach out to friends and family because you're having another episode and it's the same as the last one you had and the one before that? I am sitting here trying to make my brain focus on work but I am screaming inside,I am desperate to talk to somebody but I feel like I will just be saying the same things I always say. I know it will pass but I feel so alone in this.
I have Schizoaffective disorder and that means I have mild hallucinations, mild delusions and Depression. Today there is a nagging beeping I can't find, points of light (I think I am also getting a migraine) depression and a sense of detachment from reality. How can I tell my loved ones these things without them shutting down? I am rambling, I guess I just want to see if anyone is around to listen to my madness or share in it.

Hi
The last 2 weeks i have been feeling off. just like i can't be bothered doing anything. i would normally get up and do things on my days off work, but lately i can't seem to get up off the couch. I even hate the thought of going to work where normally work would be fine. Don't feel like talking to anyone and it's an effort to have a shower, do dishes, etc 
I have been on an antideppressant for 2 years (was put on for anxiety) and just wondering if meds sometimes just stop working?
So all these thoughts racing through my head at the moment and not sure if this is just a normal lull in life. Thinking that i should be able to shake it off and force myself to do things then i'll start feeling ok again. Or if it is depression......
ps. am going to doctor to get advice on the meds but would love to hear other peoples experiences.
thanks.

I find these days hard because I have to interact with people and spend several hours at Christmas lunch and dinner and appear to be fine. I'm very low, and I want to curl up quietly for a few days. Instead I have a house full of people and scheduled events and demands. I just wanted to tell someone. My psychiatrist is of course on holidays.

I decided to post how I feel because I know that my Anxiety is much worse then ever at the moment and I know it's been triggered by my work place. I work in a Government department and I've noticed the gradual decline of Staff levels over the last 10 years and we are working much harder now then ever. I have always been a reliable worker and never complain about my busy days and I work part time, 3 days a week. At work, I just kept on doing the harder Client service jobs but over the last month, I've noticed that I have not as much energy at work and when I get home I haven't got any energy left at all and my husband then just gets the dinner ready and thinks that I'm being lazy. Last Wednesday, I burst into tears to my Manager and said ""I've had enough of this place, I can't stand that there are slackers here and I do their work for them when they ignore the counter and they don't give much support back."" I told her this place is making me depressed and sad and then I realised that explains why I'm so tired all the time too! I already suffer from Anxiety and not only do I get the buttleflies in my stomach but also now for work related depression! I feel more sensitive then ever to other people's comments or criticism. I especially feel hurt from someone I know, eg. A Teacher shrugged me off with a comment about how she is busy and can't think right now while I was telling her something quickly about my boy. Another eg. Last night my brother in law made a comment""Just go to the car!"" as I was telling him something while walking out. I always feel when people I know do this to me, that it's unjust and unfair as I would never talk to them like that and I'm not rude. I see a Pyschologist and I have meditation breaks. I do Yoga 3-4 times a week which has helped my breathing. I know that it takes practice and consistency but I hope that when I do get off guard by People, I won't feel the butterflies and hurt and I'll stop dwelling on those conversations! Fortunately, my Manager understands that I have anxiety and mild depression now and will put me less at the client service counter. I know that as I'm doing it all naturally without medication it's tough navigating through life with other people and their criticism and shrugging off rude attitudes but I will have times to myself where I will do my yoga or see a movie which is a great diversion from these people that are in my life! Thankyou. I hope there's other similar stories out there maybe?

Why? Why do I feel this way? I am blessed with 4 healthy beautiful children but yet I'm struggling with the never ending battle in my head. 
I should be a happy 30 year old woman but yet I am struggling. 
My depression has been a curse I can't enjoy life anymore. My depression has taken over it's been a constant battle for the last 6 years of my life. 
Even trying to type this the tears roll down my face my kids are asleep and excited for Santa to come soon and all I can think of is I think I am ready to go home. I can not deal with this anymore why has this consumed me for the last 6 years? I wouldn't wish this upon my worst enemy. I can no longer be medicated for my depression/anxiety/ptsd because I abused the medications on two occasions. I am finding it really difficult to survive each day with any help on top all my health issues. 
DEPRESSION I HATE YOU SO MUCH! You have and still control my life. Let me be HAPPY!

Is anyone studying at TAFE or Uni and finding it overwhelming?
I seem to be only retaining 10% of what I hear and don't trust anything I am doing to be right.
I have always considered myself to be extremely intelligent but combining the effects of being an older person in a dismal job market with going back to study (something I have wanted to study all of my life) and 25 years in a relationship where I came to doubt my intelligence, I am beginning to think I am too stupid to learn or get work.
Study was supposed to be my big positive so I could move forward, but it is turning out to be a huge stressor instead because I don't trust my mind and second guess everything I am doing. It is taking a ridiculous amount of time for me to get the assignments done and I feel like I have learned nothing, but then I get good results every time.
When I have studied previously, I never had these issues, even thought I had already been diagnosed with depression by then.
Anyone else have this experience?

I had depression in 2000 so 16 years later at a time I was doing all those positive things everyone suggests and actually felt safe and happy to do them. I meet alot of people who welcomed me with open arms to now the complete opposite.
It all started getting my attention through my thoughts and me basically fighting myself but to the point it was just way to uncontrollable.
I sort help bringing my partner with me because I was so desperate to get help which I have now received. On that note its so interesting when I mention whats been going on with me to selected people they mention me having courage which off course I laugh at because I certainly had more to be scared from just from myself at night and in my dreams. I think I am getting what they mean now bit like the Lion in Wizard of Oz.
I went onto medication which helped me sleep but too much still.
I have some medical conditions as well which are chronic Type 1 Diabetes since 2 and heart disease By pass in 20005.They do not cause this though to me.
Its all about thoughts on the negative for me and then I go into an instant feeling for the thoughts. I reckon its crazy stuff because I do not understand why now and I am a person who is about solutions. I enjoy arts and crafts and am quite capable of creating things. But for this to happen now just took me away. 
Interesting enough I am happier in a supportive role for others but that just might be the problem.I purposely took myself out of society because of how I was feeling.
I get annoyed when I am told its chemical stuff cause I wanna know what chemical is doing that then?
I have always seen my Diabetes as saving me because no matter what is going on I always look after it by doing the injections everyday and looking after it the best I can. Its my personal sign that I will be ok and I have broken down what I can do everyday. It is not how I use to be though I guess I miss the old me. Who knows a new one might come along or at least an answer be nice.
Its tough out there when this happens society do not know how to respond I get it so I have selected who to talk too because I am not here to change society. I know they too are getting on with life in their way, i might need to find  mine.
Well I hope this helps someone it helped me to write a tiny little bit today so cheers for starting this forum.
Hope to be giggling more soon.
Meds are helping me so thats a positive so far.

Hi all. Im a 42 yo mother and dont know what came first, my depression or alcohol dependence. Either way, i am struggling at the moment with self destructive choices past and present snd know alcohol is usually involved. My ex who has main custody of our kids has just this week changes their schools without telling me and my joungest cant remember the school name and my eldest who is 14 sides with her dad and is evading the answer. I have always been involved with kids sport school life thrown all birthdays buy Xmas presents and paid guitar and karate. Now my involvement has been limited due to geographical reasons, I don't drive( lost my licence 5 years ago DUI) and cant afford a car now due to high maintence I pay and living costs and am considering bankrupsy. I am a nurse have a successful career but my personal issues are causing me extreme anxiety, i was in bed for 3 days since Monday and still unable too eat. Having my kids this weekend has helped.I only see them every second weekend. I have limited social life as all my family are interstate and I lost friends when I left my ex 6 years ago, I have only 2 friends.I have had lots of psychological therapy until since a year and half ago and am on medication for 14 years. My ex triggers my meltdowns so i think i need help again. I am hoping not to drink as it just gets me into trouble, i text my ex things I usually wouldn't and its only making my situation too see my kids worse thus again increases anxiety. Is anyone else in or been through a similar situation. I would love to hear how you cope . cheers

I suffer from severe depression and take medication. It has been controlled but over the last two years my life has been in turmoil and I feel powerless to do anything about it.
I lost my mum (who was also my best friend) to cancer, then my gran to old age, then my partner to an ice addiction which also resulted in him making bad choices and our home being raided and turned upside down twice by the police and then me having to go to court. I've never committed a crime or had any negative dealings with the police so this was very frightening for me on top of my partner acting like a crazy person.
Although things have settled down a bit, I never feel okay anymore. I'm constantly effected by my depression and always have this strong urge to just get in my car and drive away and detach myself from everyone and everything and just start over.
I feel like I'm losing my mind. I feel like I've watched my life go downhill and couldn't do anything about it.
Any suggestions for bouncing back? I know a lot of people put there have been through a lot so how did you get back to feeling normal?
Thanks so much!

I've never shared this with any of my friends. When I was a young, naive teenager I feel pregnant to the type of guy you wouldn't bring home to meet the parents.  Being so young, I struggled greatly with coming to terms with the gravity of being responsible for another human being, but also felt the overwhelming excitement of creating a little person and being a mum.  All those maternal instincts kicking in and  so many hormones and emotions going on for me all at once.  After much counseling and consideration I decided to terminate the pregnancy.  The pain of carrying to full term and then giving up the child for adoption was too great for me, and I was not fit to raise a child on my own. Looking back, I felt a lot of pressure from my family and the counselor in my decision but I knew it was the right thing to do at the time, for many reasons.  It kind of felt like the easy way out. But I agonized over my decision, and I've spent most of my life hating myself and regretting it.   I never forgave myself. I had nightmares for years and still now I get a deep pang of guilt and shame when I think about it.  I do wonder how different my life would be if I had chosen a different path. I feel like such a selfish, horrible human being.  I had a choice and maybe it was the wrong choice, but at the time I was not able to make those decisions for myself.  I guess we all make poor choices in life and have to learn from them.  Trying hard to let go. I'm learning to forgive myself.  It's hard tho.

So I finally went to my GP and have been prescribed antidepressants for my depression. I work in a job where I'm ""the brave hero"" I often attend jobs to assist people who aren't coping and even jobs where help was to late.  The thought of ""us"" not coping is a subject my colleague don't discuss as we are supposed to be the strong brave ones. When I am the brave one I know I don't judge the people who ask for my help. But now I'm the one needing help and judging myself. 
I feel like I'm only half a person, not normal and compleatly different and detached especially from my work colleagues and don't really want to admit what's going on in my head. I feel like if my colleagues knew what was going on none of them would want to work along side me. However if the shoe was on the other foot I wouldn't have an issue.
Any one else had this type of struggle, any ideas on how to change my mind set?

I recently left my job because of bipolar disorder and anxiety but I feel as though I made a mistake. It's an excuse and I allowed it to rule me. 
Let me preface this by saying I have been working in CS (customer service) for 20+ years and HATE it but now I am sitting around doing nothing, and I had a job! I stayed in it longer than most jobs and now I ruined it again. 
Now I'm broke and unhappy and this stupid vicious cycle keeps turning - I'm putting weight on thanks to the medication and half the time I just wish I could disappear and stop being such a loser... 
 Sorry, just venting

I thought coming to terms with my depression would be a big step forward in recovery rather than ignoring it and spiralling further into an episode. What I've found is the opposite, I have 3 months off and I was wondering if anyone else experiences the same feelings as me. I have so much time on my hands to think, the longer I isolate myself the more unrealistic and unenthusiastic to leave the house I become and thus the more isolated I become. Despite knowing exactly what I can do to alleviate some of the body image stress that contributes to my episode, I can't do it because my depression gives me know energy and fearful of failure. Everyone is all or nothing with my depression- I can't eat balanced it's either trash or starvation, 100% work ethic or nothing because everything that isn't black or white requires too much effort or thinking- depression is making me one dimensional and it is making me resent everybody in my life because everywhere I look everyone is happy and I am struggling

I live in a very remote town in WA. I've never reached out for help with my mental health but this time I just can't seem to get out of the black hole on my own.  I have a beautiful life with a loving husband but inside me is a black hole that sucks all the positivity out of me.  I can usually bring myself through but it's bern getting worse this year. 
 I can't find happiness, contentment, I'm worrying about small things, my confidence is slipping away, I'm becoming anti social,  my motivation in work is zero,  my brain feels all fuzzy and all i want to do is sleep or watch mind numbing tv shows. I must be a complete misery to live with for my poor husband and I just want to feel normal again.
 I just don't know where to start with getting help in Australia and my remote town.  I've worked in mental health services in the uk so I know where to look online but i feel I'm past self help. Can anyone recommend a service that provides video chat or something?

Ok,So, I'm new to this forum and just trying different things to help me understand things more about myself. I really just want to dive into things and avoid too much back story, but I feel in any case this is going to be a long post. I have a huge list of things that I feel needs to be attended to, but one that has impacted me the most lately has been a huge struggle in concentration, focus and memory. I don't know why or what exactly is the main cause but it is seriously frustrating for me. It lost me jobs in the past, it makes it finding employment in general near impossible. I stutter my word, have trouble thinking on the spot and blank out frequently in conversation and even at times forget what I was talking about mid sentence. Which makes almost every social encounter or interview stressful and strenuous, as I try to avoid coming of like a complete idiot. I thought it may have been caused by depression, as I have heard memory fog and fatigue is a common symptom for depression/Anxiety and stress. Which I have been diagnosed with in the past.
This year I made a huge effort to try and overcome my depression. Spent more time with friends and going to gym almost every day. However, I still feel fatigued, lazy and dumb. I still feel mindless and I can't seem to change that. I still struggle with forcing myself to think and remember things. I don't feel as bad as I have in the past, in fact I felt like my depression was almost completely gone. I still have breakdowns like once a month. But the days in between I feel happier. But, I feel like this lack in concentration is going to be what buries me again.
It's hard to explain how I feel, it's like I'm always tired but I get plenty of sleep. It's like my brain just doesn't think any knowledge is important enough to store. My mind is always foggy, I'm constantly catching myself spacing out and having to re-adjust my focus only to lose it again. It's just like my brain is switched off, it doesn't want to work no matter what I do. I've tried reading books, watching documentaries.. and I end up giving up because I get half way through and can rarely recall any of it. It's so annoying, and has such a huge impact on me in every aspect of my life. Both work related and socially. I live in an irrational fear of coming of dumb or an idiot to everyone I meet... 

I'll need to continue this in the comments..

Good afternoon
This week, I've had one of the worst weeks in a while. To go back what has happened this week, there is a lady that works for us, she is a training co-ordinator and I'm a receptionist. I'm not sure why, but this lady feels the need to talk to me like I'm beneath her. I've not done anything wrong to this lady, I've respected her and do as she says, fair enough I make my mistakes which probably annoy her but I don't feel like it's necessary to talk to me like a child.
This behaviour of hers, has been happening for a few months now. She's nice to me but when some thing bugs her or ""I'm not doing my job right"" she will ensure to let me know how disappointed she is with me.
After she spoke to me in quite a bitchy tone, I went down stairs to my office but I had a massive panic attack. I was crying and upset, I was just trying to do my job and this women shuts me down. I mustered up every courage I could, to go to my bosses office and inform him of the way she speaks to me and treats me.
Then the worst topic, of all...came up.
The industry that I work in, a training company that delivers qualifications, gets a portion of government funding to deliver subsidised training to those in NSW. Apparently, the company won't be getting as much money to deliver courses to our regional area and there fore my boss has had to make a ""regrettable"" decision to retrench me.
I'm in a state of shock and anger because - even though my boss said it had affected 2 others apart from me, in the workplace - the other two ""retrenched"" workers, will do odd jobs around the place for him. Now, on top of everything else, I feel like my boss is lying to me - because even though he says his decision was incredibly hard, I feel like it wasn't.
Over the course of 4 months of what's happened to me at work:
- My boss hired a new woman to work with us to take some load of my shoulders as I was taking a lot of tasks and responsibilities on my own and doing things that I wasn't qualified for
-Slowly, but surely some of those responsibilities were taken off me, however more and more skills and responsibilities were fading from me...the training coordinator was taking everything on; leaving me with not much to do.
- My boss during this time was a little stand off-ish towards me and not talking to me much...avoiding me...not introducing me to clients that walked into our business.
I'm feeling lost and upset because I need this job. I don't know how to accept what's happened :(

Hi, I'm 23, 27 weeks pregnant and am suffering from prenatal depression. I have a loving family and partner but I have never felt so alone in my life. I don't resent my child, I just feel numb and severely sad. I am aware that hormones play a particular role, I have been depressed before and I know that how I am feeling is beyond hormonal changes. 
 I just don't want to feel so isolated and want this pain to go away.

I turn 35 this week and am so frustrated lately, I feel like a 12 year old. I live with my parents, Mum bosses me around and tells me what to do like a 12 year old then Dad takes over and does things for me like I'm a child. If I don't do the dishes pronto by a certain time, he takes over amongst other things. They went away for 12 days in August and I looked after my disabled brother, it was nice to have responsibility and if I didn't do something it just sat there until I did.
the house is being sold and dad mentioned paying out my debt, I'm just waiting to see what happens so I can decide my next move. 
Anyone else feel like a big child? Any advice?!?!

I should be feeling great, but I'm not, 
I feel like I've nothing to look forward to, my wife finds me difficult to deal with and distant, and when needed to do something can become quite snappy
Over the past couple years my sleeping habits have decreased to approx 5 hours sleep a night, 
i eat quite allot as well I would say this year alone I have gained 20kgs and close to 30 kgs in the last 2 years 
I have also lost all motivation and drive in all aspects of my life, I don't do any physical activity at all, at my job I used to be quite motivated I find myself taking 2-3 times longer to do things that used to take me half a day, most days I don't even want to go in to work,

But from experience this good feeling i get even without alcohol only seems to last one hour around twice a day. I'm always thinking could be about what medication to take, whether to use drugs, work, girlfriend, living conditions etc my life is fine i just tend to think alot.

I'm freaking out . I'm having trouble breathing, I don't know what to do. I don't want to talk to anybody on the phone. But I don't know where to turn. I've been drinking and doing drugs for days, it's become a bad cycle, and I feel unsafe and scared. I'm trying to tell myself to breathe and things will change in the future, but I've done so many awful or dangerous things when drinking, a lot I don't even remember, but it feels like too much, and I'm scared the little bit of sanity I have left is going to disappear and I'm really going to hurt myself, and I don't want to, but I don't think I will be able to control it.
I'm sorry this is rambling and incoherent. I don't know what to do. I know a big part is not taking my meds all the time, and the alcohol and drugs. I've been seeing a doctor and a psychologist for depression, anxiety, BPD and grief counseling. But it's all become too much. I'm scared. I've lost everything over the past 6 months, and been using alcohol and drugs to cope, though I know it's bad. But even sober all I feel is either nothing or everything. I can't cope anymore.

It's funny the things that trigger our emotions.  This morning I was waiting for an FBT and had been waiting nearly an hour when in walked 2 people who were bumped up the queue and I was told I had to go to another clinic because they were priority.  I had already been fasting since early last night and had a terrible headache and also had another appointment I needed to be at.  I was so full of rage at this point that I nearly knocked over the apologetic phlebotomist and stormed out of the clinic, stomped over to my car and drove off like a maniac.  Don't know how I didn't crash my car but I was thrashing my fists against the steering wheel screaming and generally acting like a crazy person.  I even starting pulling my hair out which I've never done before.  I am so ashamed of myself for reacting like this.  Just made me realize how bad my anger issues are and that I really need to do something about it.  It's been brought up with different therapists but never really got to the core or worked out strategies that are helpful.  Or perhaps I just wasn't willing to take on all the advice.  I tend to forget things a lot and I'm often spaced out and too exhausted to think. I also find it difficult to talk about stuff in person and seem to be better writing stuff down. I even tried online counseling in the hope this would resolve my face to face shyness but he kept asking me the same questions and it felt like a waste of time and money.  I've tried mindfulness but I don't seem to be able to channel my anger in the split moment it grips me.  I know I need help.  I'm so upset right now I'm a total mess.  Having no friends or social support doesn't help either.  I hate who I am right now.

Hi! A bit about me and what brought me here. So I have had depression/anxiety/panic disorder most likely since I was young. There was a time when I was a little girl when my whole world changed (mum went back to work more, my brother changed schools, my best friend moved schools, I wasn't in the same class as my friends) and I ended up suffering from severe separation anxiety (I  remember one time sleeping over at my friends house, and bursting into tears when mum pulled out of the driveway). I was taken to a child psych and eventually it sorted itself out. Next 15 years are reasonably stable (apart from the odd bout when being dumped by whomever I was with at the time). Fast forward to 2011 when I started a new job where unfortunately the Manager had issues of her own, and relentlessly bullied me everyday for about 6 months until she left. Got so low that I one day rang Lifeline, where my guardian angel said 'I used to be a mental health nurse, you have the symptoms of Depression/Anxiety/Panic Disorder, go to your GP'. Off to the GP I went, and away I walked with a script for AD's that I have been on ever since. Fast forward 12 months, and after making some life changes I am hit again. This time due to the stress of moving into my in-laws house. Once again I am back to the psych (EAP is amazing), and am asking my GP for increase in my dose of AD's (which I got). 2 years go by without an episode. My Husband and I get engaged and wham here it comes again! This time due to the pressure of planning a wedding. Once again back the psych and it all gets sorted. 18 months goes by, we move into our house, we get married all is well. Then my husband insists that I do a sleep study due to my snoring and constant tiredness. Turns out I have severe obstructive sleep apnea that means that I either have to have a CPAP machine for the rest of my life (I'm 30), or have massive jaw surgery to open my airways. I deal with it fine until I see the surgeon about 6 weeks ago and BAM! it's back again, and this time with a vengeance! I have being doing CBT with a psych, while waiting for the surgery (which will be in about 12 months time, as there is prep work that needs to be done) I have purchased a CPAP so I can sleep, and have had a med review with my GP who has changed me to a different SSRI. I have my up days (mum said I sounded quite chirpy last night) and my down (I woke up feeling awful this morning).

I've been seeing my psychologist now for 8 weeks.  I was referred to him after walking into my GP's office and finally asking for help.  I was diagnosed with depression.  All I know is that I was in the darkest rut of my life.
My weekly sessions with my psychologist have been pivotal for me in navigating my way out of the rut.  Trying to find my direction. 
I understand finding our own way is a process.  The biggest issue for me is that I totally burnt myself out in my career.  My job occupied my days & nights, and pretty soon I didn't have much of a life outside of work.  I allowed my role to define me. Once the company closed I was completely burnt, lost & unemployed.  I had no idea what direction to head in or what I even wanted to do with myself.  Returning to a similar role now fills me with a sense of claustrophobia & dread.  
So here I am for the first time in 20 years in the midst of a career break.  
Through working with my psychologist, I've finally reached a point where I've given myself permission to take this time to restore & re-evaluate (it wasn't easy, let me tell you).  He assures me that I will regain my mojo and find my direction.  My vision.  That once I do I'll be off & running again.  But for now focus on restoring as I run the risk of reentering the workforce to early.
I've also now found I'm a bit of a misfit to those around me.  Taking a career break is frowned upon in my circle.  It makes others uncomfortable.  People don't seem to understand the concept of restoring.  Not when everyone is so busy.  It's hard to explain that I'm restoring. That I'm learning how to take care of myself.  That I'm trying to put in place healthier long term  habits.  That I'm walking my dog each day, attending fitness classes a couple of times a week, cooking, gardening, reading, watching movies & catching up with friends. That I'm trying to discover what I actually like doing.  As all I seem to know is how to push myself in my career.
But the hardest thing is trusting that I will recover.  That I will once again find my direction.  
So I'm taking it one day at a time.  Some days are better than others.  On those not so good days I can't seem to make sense of how I got here.  When last year I seemed to be at the prime of my career.  But then I have to remind myself that I've been pushing for a long time now.  Something had to give.  At some point I needed to re-evaluate.  I just didn't expect to feel so lost in the process.
 HG.

I'm writing this because I dont want to be like this anymore, and I want to be as well as I can possibly be. 
My username is CompulsiveLiar. Thats who I have been. I spent most of my life telling lies to survive. I imagine some people reading this will question whether or not I am actually telling the truth. Thats what sucks about telling people that I am recovering compulsive liar, people dont believe liars. And rightfully so. But I believe that a liar can learn to not tell lies. Its a tough habit to break, but it is possible.
Like many I had a brutal childhood, as a young boy. I had a very cruel mother. But I do forgive her. She was sick too. Shes a lot better now. I will never ever live with her again. But, shes happy in her pocket of the universe, and me in mine. I love her dearly. She did her best. Took me a long time to admit that, mum was in a lot of emotional pain. I didnt get that then. Still dont fully understand emotions. This disorders inhibits me from feeling like most people feel.
And, like most people with ASPD, I also suffered with a Conduct Disorder, as a child. Ive never been to prison. Though I do have criminal convictions. 
Im writing because this is all part of a therapeutic process for me. Its important for me to start telling the truth as much as I can to generate new habits, to tell the truth. Im using this forum because its a safe way for me to be honest, without the anxiety of being judged or criticised for having this disorder. Ive had a look around and I dont see many posts about this disorder though, and Im not surprised. Most people with ASPD dont come forward to get help, unless its due to a court order. 
Im not expecting much, and Im not looking for sympathy or anything like that. Ive hurt alot of people along the way, and I dont want to do that anymore. So much so, that it hurts, and the weird thing is that its good that it hurts, because Im feeling remorse!. They say people like me dont feel that but I swear thats what Im feeling. 
Im so sorry to everyone in this world that I have ever hurt. Im so very sorry. I wish that I wasnt born this way but I have to make the most of the hand that I have been dealt. I read a post on here, about limiting beliefs and taking responsibility, and thats where I am at. I so desperately want to step up and be the man that I know that I can be.
Coming clean like this is a big deal for me. And I feel good being able to share this, without guilt, shame and fear.
Thank you all very much!.

Hey everyone, just looking for some perspective, and a place to vent a little bit. Hoping I don't ramble too much, want to give a decent amount of detail.
 Been studying off and on for a few years now, and looking to finish up my uni degree fairly soon. I do have regular setbacks though, and it makes me real anxious when I sit down to do what I have to finish, so it's taken a bit longer than the average student. Recently talked with my psychologist about what I thought may have been Borderline PD, but she suggested it might be complex-PTSD instead, that's its own story. Also comes packaged with major depression, and anxiety. So, it can be difficult to do things that some people find easy. 
 I have a partner, who has had depression in the past, but she's mostly good now and works as an intern doctor right now. It can be frustrating and upsetting for me when she says things like ""I just wish you could get a job"" when I've got study to finish, and at best would be working part-time. We've had issues about money and paying equal share in things, but I don't come anywhere near to her level of income, and probably won't, ever. Still, I do stress about finances and being independent, but it's just not the reality of the situation for now. 
I have been applying for tons of jobs, but never get a callback on anything. This makes me feel pretty awful, and makes me think I'm a waste of space and will just be broke and miserable forever. It's also making me feel bad, because my partner is moving interstate soon, and I won't be able to go with her straight away, and am not sure when I'll have enough money to move interstate as well. 
 I try to do mindfulness exercises and try to think more objectively, but I really struggle a lot lately, which affects my progress at uni, and not getting anywhere applying for jobs makes me think I'll be unemployable forever due to being 32 and having not held down a proper job in that time. I don't even hear back about cleaning jobs, even though I'd hate that and it'd make me miserable, having to do that kind of job even after getting educated. I had a look into doing Uber driving out of desperation, and yeah I don't want to go through all that really, seems like a lot of outlay and risk for me with very little benefit, and would make me feel worse. I just feel like I want to disappear and not have to deal with any of this. I'm not going anywhere positive in my life.

Hi everyone,
Recently I have been diagnosed with BPD. For those of you who don't know what that entails, it's a mixture of feeling empty, low self-esteem, Paranoia or emotional detachment, Anxiety about relationships, efforts to avoid being abandoned,Impulsive, risky behaviour, Self-harm, threatening or attempting suicide, Anger, moodiness and irritability. 
I also have depression and anxiety and my medication are definitely doing there job. I'm just worried about my constant efforts to be apart of risky behaviours, it's as if I get a rush off them. I feel like I'm going to put myself in a lot of danger one day and I would like some advice as to what to do before it gets to that ? 
 
Thank you !

Hi Guys,
 I am new here and i guess i joined because until 6 months ago i thought i had all the support i ever needed, until i actually asked for it and struggling on my own hasn't been working so i hope this helps. 
3 years ago i was told i had a serious hear condition which caused my to faint up to 21 times a day, this was brought on by stress. I will stress, worry about everything and everyone. I try and make sure they are ok, taken care of, looked after at all times. I have dealt with this medical issue and i thought i was on the mend until 6 months ago when i was told i can't have children due to the damage i have caused my heart over the years i just won't be strong enough to pump blood for me and a baby. There is an 85% chance i will die if i fall pregnant. I have been in a hole ever since. My friends have all left because i don't pay them enough attention anymore and i can't tell my family it would kill them so its just me alone stressing (ironically) about the future. I am only 24 years old and didnt want children yet but it was like a switch, the moment i heard that news come out of the doctors mouth that was it and i am so tired. I am tired of crying, of being alone, not wanting to wake up in the morning because i know my dreams are much better than my actual life. I never knew you could  miss something i never had. I don't know if i should even be this upset sometimes i think there are people out there much worse off than me but i don't know how to shake this, i lay at home alone every night realising that the one thing i have always wanted was to be a mum and now i can't do that and its my fault. I don't know what to do i haven't slept in 6 months and i barley eat now. I think being alone is the hardest thing of all with no one to talk to or make sure i am ok. What can i do to get out of this hole i am in? X

Hi Team,
I've heard plenty of awesome things about these forums, and I know how great BeyondBlue as an organisation is to help with Depression and Anxiety, so I decided to join and tell my story.
I've been battling some serious depression and anxiety for 2 years now, and I'm really at a low point. A few points to provide some context, I am a 32 year old male who is an Exercise Physiologist, as well as a Dad to a beautiful infant boy. 
Not sure how or why the anxiety or depression started, but each day now is a constant battle. My job requires a lot of positive energy, as well as being a good dad and husband. Energy which, unfortunatley, I just don't have. Of course like everyone I had good and bad days, but the bad days are really bad.
As a Health Professional, embarrasing to say my health is probably the worst it's ever been. I am putting on weight/bodyfat due to the almost non stop flow of stress hormones that are absoloutley tearing my nervous system apart. My CNS is drained, depleted, and broken. I'm broken. Apart from the anxiety and depression, I also suffer from OCD, Misophonia (hatred of select sound), ADHD-PI. 
I know each of these can be related to an overactive nervous system, and gut health, however I'm at a total loss of how I will fix this. I eat plenty of vegetables, keep refined sugars to an absoloute minimum, and limit alcohol. My one vice is caffeine, but working in the job I do, I feel it's the only way I can get through each day.
Part of me wants to live in a cave. Part of me wants to stop my job (which I've given up a good government job for and studied for 5 years to get) and focus on my own health while I work a job more suited to depression. 
I want to get better, and for the sake of my family, will never lose hope. However, I'm completley at a loss as to how to direct my rehabilitation. I've been on AD's which unfortunatley did nothing for me, and feel the one way I can solve my issue is by fixing my poor, toxic inflamed gut and broken body. I should have the answers being an Exercise Professional, but I don't. 
This is my cry for help.

I want to vent but if anyone has any suggestions I will accept them too.
My depression has slipped again and I am having difficulty with it.
I was due to go to New Zealand in February to catch up with a childhood best friend, tickets payed for and sooo looking forward to it. 
I was having a lot of trouble with one of my knees, more than normal, an MRI (have had arthritis since my 20s) later and NZ trip cancelled, (did get 75% of tickets refunded) now on waiting list for a knee replacement.  I am in constant pain during the day and at night, so not sleeping. Due to medical condition I can't take pain killers or anti-inflammatory. I don't have a car anymore, it died, taking public transport but the extra walking I think is what has aggravated my knee.
Consequently my depression has gone down due to pain, and tiredness from not sleeping. When my depression goes down my food consumption goes up and that makes me more depressed.
Saw my psychologist Tuesday and she wants me to take something to help me sleep, I have always been against sleeping tablets.  She also wants me to see a dietician.
I am sick of feeling down and having to fight with my depression, I still maintain all my outside activities which I know is vital.  My friends don't really get it.  I have one friend who tries her hardest but sometimes I just want a hug.
I feel teary and I am having to fight the feelings of wanting to give into to it.  I am at my volunteer job using their computer to write this.
I just feel like shit.

Feeling really crap today.  Sometimes it helps to talk about it, but I'm not very good at that either.  Slept in and after a cup of coffee I thought I'd put on a nice dress to go to the shops.  I thought the distraction would help. It didn't. In fact I started to tense up the minute I got out of my car, tried to slow my breathing but just felt worse with each step. (social anxiety). Had to get a script from the chemist and had the intention of doing a bit of shopping while I waited but I couldn't breathe so I ended up sitting in my car and listening to music.  That calmed me down but then I couldn't stop crying.  Just feeling sorry for myself I guess.  I hate feeling like this.  I don't have anyone to talk to as I've become a total A hole and have no friends thanks to my mood disorder and long term depression and anxiety.  Probably serves me right and I deserve everything I get.  Sick of these mood swings.  Already talked it over with doc.  Says to amp up the dose again. Then I think what's the point really?  I should go try another psych but I can't seem to change who I am so why bother trying. I'm so tired of everything.

I've arrived recently to Australia. Came with an open mind and an open heart. Looking forward to the new life, and the dreams I wanted to achieve.
I've always been a man with massive ambition, I want to achieve in life.
I'm 39 y/o, no family, and no friends. And it seems this is having its toll on me; I spend long weeks not talking to anyone, and to make things worse, I'm an introvert, so for me to start a conversation is an alien concept to me. Loneliness is a monster, and I don't know how can I be so poor when it comes to social skills. I know how to keep a conversation going, but it's like there is nobody interested in talking to anybody -not just me-. And it's like I picked the wrong time to be in Australia, with the hostile atmosphere towards immigrants. If everyone didn't want us arriving here, why do you have a skilled migrant program then?
I started developing dark thoughts, I can't really describe what is going on, it's a mix of thoughts; Did I fail in life? Was I too old to come here -since everyone my age is already married and settled in life socially-, so they nobody welcomes anyone onboard anymore?
And to top it all, I'm without a job -I apply to tens of jobs within my field or closely-related fields- and I barely get a callback.
I keep telling myself to ""keep pushing, not to give up, not yet"", but I fear that my grip is becoming weaker. I had friends where I came from. I miss our laughs and time together. I wish I wasn't a person who blindly follows his ambition, I just wanted to make something awesome out of my life. I feel lost. I feel my dreams abandoned me.
I keep saying ""It could be worse"", or ""Someone else in this world wishes he could swap his life with yours"". But, who wants to live a life so silent, that the only conversations I have are the ones I have with myself..? I literally speak out loud to myself about whatever topics that jumps on my mind, and sometimes I stop talking, and wonder if this means I have officially lost my mind.
I looked around online for social meetings for people around my age, but they all look so happy and as if they own the world already. Plus it would cost to go out to where they normally go.
Was life meant to be like this..? And what is so unrealistic about me expecting the minimum social life a human is worthy of having..?
I'm sorry if this wasn't meant to be here, I have nowhere else to post, and literally nobody else to talk to.

Hi all,
I am new to this page as a member although I have used the facilities in the past for information and help. About 3 years ago I fell into a severe depression and entered a mental health plan, started medication etc. my psychologist was great and managed to really get on top of the worst parts of the depression that was affecting my work, and social life. 
Although I felt there have been some minor bumps which I have managed to keep in check using the cognitive therapy I really focused on, as of the last 6 months the feelings of emptiness and lack of motivation/sleep have really stopped my life. Last month I lost my job and have financially damaged myself, as someone who has a mortgage and maintained a relatively comfortable lifestyle with my job and pay. I'm really feeling this snowballing. of the last 3 deeply paralysing episodes I've had ie not leaving house no contact with family friends etc both have ended with a significant burst of energy, positive feelings and ideas to fix the problems that seemed impossible to overcome only a few hours earlier. theres are few other characteristics which do suit some of the mild symptoms of bi-polar or hypermanic depression. 
My question is, is bi-polar or hypermanic depression something that can develop? Or happen in what feels like such a short time? I am prepared to fight this along with my psychologists help but I really want to talk to someone who has had a similar story, to confirm with my psych as we are both trying to diagnose or figure where my depression is leading
 
thank you

I have suffered from depression for most of my adult life, and it all hit its peak about 3 years ago when I become non functioning. Really handy when I was in the last year of a Uni course, but looking at a computer screen for 3 hours and writing one sentence(which didn't make sense) told me I was cooked. Everything in my life went to garbage, and as usual it was all my fault. I refused to talk to anyone, my daughter was terrified about what I was doing(I wouldn't eat), and my wife eventually gave up on me, and I couldn't blame her, as it was all me. I went to psychologist's(waste of my time, I have done plenty of psych interviews in my time as a nurse), and then a psychiatrist, who like my GP actually gave up on me.
 I actually feel no ill will towards then as I was unreachable, and although I tried all the meds they put me on(anti depressives, anti anxiety and eventually anti psychotics to control my anxiety) nothing really worked. The only thing that worked for me was to shut myself off and embrace the very small support network I actually could deal with(my wife, my daughter and my Grandfather).
My wife had drifted away from me as she could not understand my weakness, as I had always been the strong one, but in my quiet emotionless way she stayed with me. Then my Grandfather died. I had been raised by my Grandparents from 2 months old, and when my Grandmother died when I was 20 it damn near killed me. But when my Grandfather died when I was 45 it was even worse, because he had become my main support structure, literally the only person I went to when things became difficult.
I now feel lost and lonely, and staring into the abyss, and all I see is black and empty. If not for my daughter I would dive into that abyss, she is my best excuse, but excuses are running out.

I am a long term sufferer of depression and generalised anxiety disorder since my late teens and I am now in my early 50s.  My problem at the moment is I just can't get motivated or feel enthusiastic about anything.  I am also having issues adjusting to one of my medications.  It is making me feel nauseous and at times I even vomit and this has been going on for months.  I generally enjoy my food, but not at the moment.  My psychiatrist wants me to have one final try at this medication, by taking a 1/2 tablet at breakfast and the other half at dinnertime, hoping to minimise the side effects.  We are reviewing this in mid December.  I'm going to make an appointment to see my GP tomorrow and discuss things with him.  He is also very supportive.
I've been caring for my husband at home for the past five weeks as he has had a major back operation.  This week he has gone back to work and I'm feeling lonely and unmotivated again.  My husband thinks I should set goals for each day and write them down to motivate me.  But I'm finding even this is too much at the moment.
Does anyone have any ideas that may be able to help me?
Thanks for reading my post.
regards, Neens.

I have a two month old baby, absolutely adore her. however I am going insane and find myself exhausted and in tears more often than not. she will only sleep when I hold her, the second I put her down she cries so I'm too scared to even try. I spend every day on the couch holding her, I don't get to eat properly, I don't get to shower and I'm the only one in the house that cleans anything so it's a pigsty. I have everyone in my ear saying I need to put her in the cot to sleep but they're not the ones who have to deal with her screaming, sometimes to the point of throwing up. I also have people telling me that I need to keep holding her if that's what she wants, that her crying will traumatise her. I try to teach her to sleep in different places without letting her cry but every time I think I'm getting somewhere she goes downhill again by the next day. I can't handle it anymore

Hi all, I was diagnosed with major depression at 14. For most of my life I was able to deal with this and live a relatively normal life. I have always considered myself to be a strong, independent and driven person. Every job Ive had I have ended up in a team leader/management role because I worked my butt off. Now at 35 I am on a disability pension due to PTSD and major depression and anxiety and I hate it. It's a miracle if I can get out of bed in the morning and the smallest task like taking a shower or doing the laundry leaves me so tired I feel like I could sleep for days.
All I want to do is get well and go back to work but I don't know how when I can't even manage to look after myself. 
What Id like to know from everyone else is how tired can depression make you? Is this normal? I eat pretty healthy, I try to exercise, I take multi vitamins and B vitamins on top of my antidepressants but nothing seems to help.
Im so tired of being tired all of the time. Can anyone offer any suggestions?
TIA :)

The past couple of weeks have really felt like the calm before the storm. Unfeeling. Unmoving. But on edge.
I have been keeping myself busy. In the last week, I've attended different meet up groups, set goals to write more, compose more, and exercise more. I've also toned right down on the dating side as well to give myself less to worry about.
And yet, with all these seemingly positive things, they all seem to just be delaying the inevitable and setting me up for a bigger and bigger crash.
I guess I'm just ranting about the fact that, frankly, I'm tired of this cycle. And sitting still to give myself space is just a foreign concept. I'm not used to waiting. I hate waiting. But I'm so tired of being worried about the inevitable :(

I suffered major depression m from the very beginning of this pregnancy and is still everywhere by this day. I could bearly have private time, even half an hour each day with hubby to share how I feel. Only tears can express my drowning sadness. Only people who have been through this understand how I feel.

Anyone got any tips on how someone can not feel so down anymore? I recently thought I had met the woman for me, but while I was staying at hers in order to get to know her she fell in love with another man and I had no where else to go so was forced to endure everything she did, how it made me feel while I was there. Now that I am back at home I am feeling very broken. I am wanting to feel better but I just don't understand how someone can put others through mental torture and she is the one who has found happiness in him and I'm the one feeling shattered. I try going for walks but my mind tells me what good is a walk going to do, when my thoughts are still going to be dealing with all this hurt and loneliness but just not at home. I just don't understand how it's fair she can put me through so many emotions, so many tears in a short space of time and she has someone now and I have no one to tell me I'll get through this...or tell me they love me. And now that she has him, I'm getting nothing but being ignored. No genuine concern for my wellbeing. Whereas I would never be able to inflict this type of pain on anyone

For many years, pre medication, I turned to alcohol to 'numb' the pain of depression and PTSD. After a period in a treatment centre, in 2013 I was alcohol free for two years and prescribed antidepressants.
The medication exacerbated my symptoms, and caused other serious, adverse side affects. I decided to come off the medication, finding the withdrawal a painful experience physically and emotionally. 
1 year ago feeling very raw, with suicidal ideation, I picked up a drink again to find some relief from the pain and fear. I have had the usual regular Psych counselling, and endeavour to do some regular walking, but I'm am finding it hard to resist having a drink to find some relief.
I would like to know if their are others of you who are unable to take medication, and how you cope.

no idea what to do ...got the psyc n gp next week but I've got nothing left to say or to feel

Hi, recently I have tried to reach out and try to find ways to mend my life, or what is left of it.
Now in early 50's I must do something or will die alone. I have cut myself off from society when I was in late 30's as I was still unmarried with few relationships. I have met females but lacked confidence, in fact I attracted women easily and had a number of female friends but was very shy and had no confidence. Looking back I was a pretty normal guy with friends and a great future in my work. Then this girl I was interested in but were only friends slept with my best mate. I was just getting over a similar thing happening to me. After that I broke down and cried and maybe had what I think is a nervous breakdown and fell on the floor, ive never been the same since.
That was the start of my life falling apart. I shut myself off from people and other things also made me feel very depressed. So I moved away from that place and moved to a new location. But the new place I had no friends or anyone I knew. I also lost all my money when I arrived, got robbed so had to start my new life from the bottom. I shut myself off from society, that was early 2000's. At the end of the decade I made money and traveled and I felt like I was living again. In fact I met a couple of women on my travels through Asia and had some relationships for the first time in decades It helped give me confidence back again and I felt like a human again but that is all in the past too now.
I returned from traveling after my money run out and my bushiness failed and now for 2 -3 years have been living alone again. I have no friends, no family. My mother passed away a few years ago who was my last family member. have no kids or anything. The only friends I have are a couple of junkies in Sydney as do not like talking to normal people as I pretty much hate society and normal life since my life is such a failure. I have not been able to hold a job, have no qualifications. I tried hard with work this year but was made to feel stupid been bossed around by kids at my work. Such horrible people.
The worse part of my life is now realizing in now in early 50's and now will live the rest of my life alone, with no children or family.

Hi everyone, this is my first time here and things are getting a bit hard for me so I just wanted to open up I guess.
I'm from the UK originally and about 5 years or so ago a doctor diagnosed me with depression. She wasn't my usual doctor and I didn't want to go onto any medication so I just accepted it and tried to manage by myself. Shortly after that I met my now fiancee and things improved. 
We've never had a great sex life which is mainly down to me and my general lack of intimacy. It sucks because I do enjoy it, just can't instigate or get really involved, but recently it's become so bad she's talking about not wanting to be in the relationship anymore. We had a baby 4 months ago so that changed things a lot, we have moved house, emigrated here a year ago (she's Australian) and I am the sole income earner on not a great salary with hardly anything left over after bills, etc. 
So basically money, relationships stuff and life pressures have been my stresses, and I can feel the depression coming back heavily. It's always popped up now and again but I've manged to deal with it, but I think this might be the last straw. I've booked in with my GP on Friday to see if there's anything I can do, but I'm worried I'm going to loose her. I don't enjoy my job, which she knows and wants me to leave it, and I feel like this is adding to the problem. I would quit today if I could but I have too much responsibility and it doesn't look like the government would help.
I guess I don't really have a question, just wanted to talk about what's happening. With emigration I don't have my family and friends around so feel quite isolated and haven't had much luck making new friends since being here. Today has been hard after this talk of ending the relationship, which I don't want to do obviously, hopefully all of this is tied together somehow and I can get help.

I'm in my late 40s and have been fighting this damn black dog my whole life.   And I'm totally exhausted from the fight.   It's getting worse with age, as it did with my brother, who was dead at 51 and my father who was dead at 66 and my grandmother who spent her final days in an asylum in the UK.   I'm not going to ""end it"" though, because I have a very loving and understanding husband and son, and I would never do that to them.   But I find myself pushing people out of my life, usually because I can't be bothered dealing with people who I feel aren't on my side, and never will be.   I can't deal with any disloyalty by ""friends"" on any level.  I'm not sure if a bit of paranoia is creeping in or if I'm just at that stage in life where I'm getting very choosy about the people in my life.  I can't be bothered doing anything.  I've given up looking for work because I know I couldn't hold down a job anyway.   The bad days are greatly outnumbering the good.  Sometimes I go days without even bothering to shower.  I have to really push myself to do even the most basic household chore.   Everything just seems pointless, EVERYTHING!   My medication works some days, and others not at all.   I've never found therapy very helpful in the past.   I'm worried that I'm in a downward spiral and not sure where it's taking me.  I really don't know what to do to stop it.   When Major Depressive Disorder is strongly genetic, as it is in my case, what can you do???  Not much I suspect!  Except to hide myself away from the world and keep pushing people away.   I know the pain that suicide causes those who are left behind, and I would never do that to my son.   My brother's suicide a few years ago affected me greatly and that's when my downward spiral began.   And of course, then there's the extremely dysfunctional childhood at the hands of an abusive alcoholic and depressed father.   Nothing works.   I'm so very tired from fighting with this black dog, I wish he'd bugger off, but I know he never will.   I'm really only writing this to get all of this crap out of my head.   I know I'm stuck with this for life.   Thank you for listening.

So I've been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. I don't suffer from schizophrenia symptoms at all as I'm on really good medication for it.
 The issue is being depressed and anxious, and it's more an emotional thing than a psychotic thing.
I have a pretty bad family life - my sister is autistic and prone to screaming tantrums and verbally attacking all of us. My dad gets bitter and short with us, especially me (I don't know why), for no good reason. The only level headed, somewhat kind person in the household is my mum, and she can be pretty spiteful at times.
 Most days of the week, I feel fine. Then sometimes, usually in the evening, I get anxiety attacks and very bad feelings of being alone and lost. My heart races, my forehead perspires, I'm gasping for air - also feeling very sad and hopeless and unwanted. I try not to feel suicidal (I'm afraid of death) but I feel so hopeless that no one loves or wants me.  
It's bad enough I don't even confide in my sister, who is closest in age to me, and my parents are always sticking up for her when we quarrel.
 I also think about and have flashbacks of my high school past, although I'm 28 now. I think about how most of the kids there treated me, ostracising me, or if they knew I existed, they would bully and make fun of me. I had a very lonely time, and had no one to talk to.
 So now my life quality has improved a lot, but I still think about those and get agitated, angry and upset. It doesn't help with my current situation at home. I have considered moving out but I can't find a job that would support me. So for the moment, I'm stuck at home with the fam.

Posted before on doubts & first psych app, eager for change! Psych app #5 is this Wed and I'm fighting the urge to cave and cancel! God I just want to never go back...
I lost motivation. Followed my psych's advice on looking for meditation apps + diffusion techniques. Started draw vent art. Had a spark to draw for fun but lost it again. My own projects and ideas are collecting dust.
I fallen back into destructive ways to cope. There's a constant weight on chest and I know too well both my depression and anxiety are winning.
I nearly cried at Workskils the other week while I was doing job searches as the constant reminder I'm unemployed hurts. Got asked about my backup plan and couldn't answer the lady (Always wanted to do art/graphic design - uni for 4 yrs, interned for 3yrs, started freelancing - Got replaced at interning, client cancelled projects, keep getting rejected by jobs). She said I have to do a group session next week and I'm freaking out. Asked why I was seeing a psych and what I'm diagnosed with and I felt ashamed. She said ""we all suffer sometimes"" which I know she was trying to be comforting but it's just more evidence I'm weak.
My family ended up in a domestic abuse situation and even though I don't live at home I always end up involved. Long story short my mum decided to stay. Because I'm already struggling, and upset with what had happened I wanted to step back. But now I've just ended up in a mess because Mum keeps saying I've abandoned her and being a bad influence to my sister. My anxiety is through the roof thinking of my Nana's and sister's birthday and Xmas around the corner... And I'm usually so close with my family so it's hard.
I'm struggling with my friends 'cause of anxiety and feel like I'm losing everyone and being replaced because I'm not like how I used to be...
I feel like I've used up all my allocated time to be broken? But everything feels worse and its winning... My psych said that I've had to deal with a lot lately and it's understandable that I finally broke. My self image is so bad though that I can't find the motivation to fight for myself... I don't deserve it. I'm so frustrated that I can't just pretend it's fine anymore... I can't find the girl that hid everything for yrs and kept going. What's the point of being me when I'm so broken? I don't bring anything of value to anyone anymore, I'm nothing special. So much bad outweighs the good this year alone that it just feels like ""what's the point anymore?""

So I've had depression for years, mixed in with anxiety and an eating disorder (amongst other things). Thats just the general background story. Thing is, I've pushed myself hard to get to the end of my degrees. And I'm done now, thats great.
I'm on medication. Most days I feel fine. I think I don't need psychological help. Then some days, like today, I cry every 10 minutes. It's like a never ending waterfall of tears and sobbing and I cant control it. It's like I just break apart. Then its those times, that I think definitely, I need help. 
 But how to deal with those insecurities that Im not sick enough to 'deserve' help? I don't want to cause a fuss. Everyone gets sad. Am I just being a weakling? I need to toughen up?
I think I'm just in need of someone to console me perhaps. I don't know. I just feel lost about whether I'll ever get better from this cycle. I'm sick of feeling like this.

I'm a male in his mid twenties who feels like the biggest failure in the world. I have had so many opportunities in life and I have failed every time. it's mainly due to substance abuse that I make terrible decisions. I'm lucky that I have above average intelligence and ive been told that when I put the work in, I look attractive however I don't feel it. It makes my life so much easier and i feel I would be much more depressed if I didnt have those two things going for me at least. my girlfriend of nearly two years, my longest relationship, dumped me earlier this year. At the time I was happy because she had been very clingy and needy at the end and she was often getting angry with me, however I understand why now. The whole time we had been dating, there had only been one moment where she felt a real connection with me. I shut her out the rest of the time emotionally. looking back, whilst I'm not under the delusion that she was the perfect person and I have dated since, I feel I made the biggest mistake by not trying harder to connect with her. she was constantly trying with me and is the most open minded person I have ever met. She understood me like nobody else has ever, including my own family and cared for me more than anyone else ever has.
aside from that I am constantly worried I am about to lose my part time job that I love and I'm now worried that I will lose the mon-Fri job I just got. I have been abusing a prescription medication. I have taken it so much that I've lost a dramatic amount of weight and I was on it at work causing problems. ive never had meth but the doses I'm having of this makes me feel like what I'd imagine meth to be like and ive stayed awake for up to three days on it, barely eating or drinking. My only salvations are the sport I train, sleeping with women (which I only managed because of my looks) and weightlifting. I haven't been able to do any of these lately due to my drug abuse, instead staying home just zoned out between wasting my life away watching pointless youtube videos. I feel anger building up inside me and I'm worried it will explode, like a jack in a box. the sport I do is a martial art and my job puts me in a position where I can hurt people and I'm very worried ill snap and do that. I've managed to push all my friends away so that I now have nobody. there's more but ive reached the length limit so ill leave it there

Hey, 
I apologise in advance, as I'm not much of a writer (or speller) and this is pretty much off the top of my head.
I've been having a bit of a hard time over the last few years,  I feel like every time an opportunity comes my way I stuff it up or I get really excited and it falls through. I make plans to better my life (study or start a business or change jobs) but whenever I get close I freak out and quit on it, I can't commit to anything because I've been so horribly let down in the past that I'm scared that I'll get hurt again.
 I work in a job where I'm made to feel stupid and useless all the time and so I get down about that, but the economy isn't great so I worry that I won't find anything better. 
Basically I'm lost, I feel empty and don't really enjoy anything anymore. I feel trapped and that I'm so much better than what I'm doing now but just can't change. I feel that I'm a loser as I'm not qualified in anything and don't own a house but at the same time I don't want that either. I spend soo much time hearing about other people's problems and I take them on board and offer advice but can't sort out my own. 
I'm not sure really why I'm writing this, I just want to be happy and ""normal"" but for some reason I'm never satisfied.
cheers
-Gary

Hi
I'm not sure what to say but here goes..
I'm 28 married for almost 8 years and have two beautiful daughters.. 
All my life I thought how i thought was normal.. I mean how was i supposed to compare?? And for as long as i can remember I have had problems with awful thought filling my head while i tried to sleep, Always feeling like no matter what I did or who I was no one liked me and everyone will leave me, to the point where I would be the reason they left.. Ive always found it hard to trust anyone because I always think everyone is lying to me and that I'm a pest and no one wants me around.. I suffered through bad bullying through 4 different schools and never really had many friends because the other girls didn't like me, which just confirmed my thoughts of myself.
I haven't just come here to tell a sob story, I need  hep as in the last month I have felt like my world was crashing around me.. My thoughts have driven me to a point where it is threatening my marriage. I wrote all my thoughts down on one particularly bad day and at the time it all sounded reasonable, but when I came back and read it on a different day it was awful and I couldn't believe I had those thoughts. I find myself a lot of the time when I am facing something emotionally difficult, that I'm trapped inside my own head with dozens of different me's all with different reactions to this situation and I don't know which one is me now.. Yet I know they ARE all how I feel..Yet at other times I fell like I emotionally switch off completely.
I'm sorry this post is disjointed as I'm writing as I'm thinking, I'm trying not to buffer my thoughts. 
I don't want to damage my marriage anymore than it is and I know with time I can work through this but I have to listen to my husband and ask for help... So here I am.. Please Help me.

I don't even know where to start. 
I've been feeling increasingly more depressed over the past few months, but I've never really dealt with depression before so it's taken me a while to realise.
It just seems like everything in my life is negative at the moment, there is literally nothing good. I don't feel comfortable talking to people I know about this kind of thing, it's just not the kind of person I am. Sometimes it's easier talking to a stranger.
My weight has always been an issue as long as I can remember, and over the past couple of years its gotten worse, and I feel like this affects every aspect of my life. I hate going to uni or generally out in public because I'm scared of being judged and this has affected my grades, meaning that I will most likely have to do another year of my degree, on top of having already done 5 years (it's a 4 year course), I hate my job, and I'm so messy and lazy I can't stand it. 
The past few weeks, and especially the past few days I just feel like crying all the time, with no exact thing that sets me off, it's just everything.
I started a new job a few months ago, and I don't feel like I belong there, I almost dread having to go there every day. The staff are all very nice, but they are all so close and it's almost like a clique. I miss my old job, I felt comfortable there and loved going, but due to problems with the boss I don't think I'll ever be working there again.
I'm just so lost, and have no motivation to lose weight or to do anything. 
 I don't know how to turn this around.

Hello,
I am new here. I have had low to moderate level anxiety and depression for around 10 years now. I have had 2 children in the past 4 years. My youngest frequently wakes and has done for 17m now. She also has allergies. Recently I have been experiencing brain fog. I have not had this as a symptom before. I have been quite forgetful, exhausted and tired. A recent example...
I have always been a very empathetic / sympathetic sensitive friend. I have close friendships. A close friend recently told me her beautiful mother passed away from brain cancer. I read the message. Felt overwhelmed. Then promptly forgot. She messaged me wondering if I had changed my number as it was so unlike me. 
Does anyone else suffer from this? Was it a depression thing or was it other things? Any things that have helped? I literally feel like a grey cloud is around my head weighing me down.

Hi. I don't really know where else to go but I'm 21 and for the past year I slowly realised I haven't been feeling okay. I started drifting away from all of my friends and have had to take a few semesters off uni. Recently I had a panic attack at home and I'm not really sure how it came about but my parents have noticed that something was wrong but when I tell them that all the pressure from uni has made me feel anxious and depressed all they say is ""you can get past it, you're almost graduating"". This sort of manifested and ate at me for so long since they have such high expectations that most days I feel so unmotivated and now I don't really enjoy all the things I love doing.
Lately I find myself staying in bed til noon most days and my parents think I'm just lazy and not following what they say. Sometimes I feel like being with them in this house 24/7 is too much and those days I end up wishing I could move out so badly. My mum thinks that I'm doing all this to purposely hurt her but that's not true at all. She keeps asking me what's wrong and I end up saying that it's nothing cause every time I try to tell her I feel like there's something wrong with me she instantly thinks that it's a problem with how she raised me and she goes on about how this is her fault and that she doesn't deserve it and maybe I'm just ""lashing"" out and choosing not to listen to her since I'm a young adult and that makes me feel even worse about myself. My parents preach so highly that I can ""talk to them about anything"" but I feel like I can only talk to them about things they want to hear.
I can't open up to my mum since she feels like everything I do is me targeting her and the fact that she thinks I would do something like that hurts me. And my dad just agrees with whatever my mum ends up saying. Recently she got really upset at me staying in bed all afternoon that she forcefully booked an appointment with the doctor and told me that I need to fix myself. I get that she wants to try to fix things but I feel that this just wedges a gap between our relationship even more. I don't really feel comfortable seeing someone yet and I don't really know what to do anymore. Most of the time I just want to sleep since I feel so alone and empty inside.

I recently suffered from depression and maybe still do though I'm feeling quite a lot better. My doctor is only concerned about a little of anxiety I've had lately. 
 
Its probably work related due to stress and little to no enjoyment in my work and people around it. 
 
But it that's my issue with the future. I don't look at no direction as no future I look at it like endless possibilities but a lot of the things I would want to do in worried now I shouldn't because of my illness. 
 i always want to be in reserves,police, paramedics, or fire & rescue. I want a meaning ful job where I try to make the world better place and help people. 
 but now what I've gone through and self harmed I figure I should never be in those positions. 
 so then I think about you other things that I thought about in past like nurse or psychologist. But once again I think because of my condition now o shouldn't be on these roles.
i know my time at work now is limited since my boss knows I have a mental illness so I really need to consider my future but I really want to pursue something I want for a change just not cover the bills.
 anyone else face these problems ?

My life would appear to be fairly simple.  Live alone, have two pets, work full time, study part time.  Have the same ups and downs as most people.  But I struggle daily with the mood swings, the feelings of hopelessness and despair, the self-loathing.  I feel like the world around me has moved forward and I'm still sitting in this time warp wondering what the hell happened.  I used to have close friends and a social life. But I ruined all that. Now all I look forward to is Netflix and study to keep my mind busy.  Days off are the worst.  I get so morbidly depressed and I have no motivation to do anything.  It's a massive challenge just to get out of bed.  I've become so bitter and hateful of everything.  I hate seeing happy couples, knowing this will never be me.  I have no one.  I often wonder if it's just my personality and I should stop trying to fight it.  Maybe I'm not meant to try and fit in.  But my job requires it.  Society demands it.  I'm so socially withdrawn I am too scared to join a club and when I have tried in the past, I end up dropping out for fear of being judged.  I hate people staring at me and judging me.  I blush a lot, which is both humiliating and counter-productive, an ongoing cycle. I work in a very busy environment with lots of people.  They all judge me and mock me.  I have made no friends because of my anger outbursts and mood swings and my introverted personality.  I just don't gel with people and am always lost for words and awkward.  Despite making consistent efforts to improve, I can't change how people feel about me.  I shouldn't care, but it's a team-based environment and I need positive feedback to progress thru my career.  Being the outsider is neither productive nor helpful for anyone.  Sometimes I think I should give everything up, start over.  This is probably the most boring invalid post.  That's who I am now.  Boring. Invalid.  Lifeless.  Stuck.

Hello. I am a mum to two beautiful children. prior to my second child i was a very calm loving parent.i had the most beautiful bond with my son who is now nearing 4. i didnt often yell. never swore infront of him (i rarely swore in general) and used to love spending quality time with him. i was very healthy and loved my regular gym sessions and running. then my hubby and i had the wonderful news we were expecting another child. once she was born it became so hard .  she was such a difficult baby. not happy .  cried all the time. full blown screaming cry. every night from 6pm-11pm she would non stop scream the house down until she was 4 months old. she would still then cry but i was able to actually settle her (breastfeeding) although it would still take her forever to go to sleep. she would not be without me either.she would not and still will not settle for anyone else or she screams to the point of choking. i can not leave her once shes asleep because she wakes up screaming at the top of her lungs. she is so attached to me which in one way is nice but i cannot catch a break day or night. it literally was not until 5 months old that during the day i could put her down ..on the floor, in a baby swing,rocker etc for just two minutes maximum before her cry would start and quickly escalate to screaming.now at 11 months although shes not as bad as she was she is still super dooper clingy with me. her cry now makes me anxious.i have become anxious. i cry all the time. yell at my kids. sometimes over nothing. sometimes full blown yelling which i should not do. theres times my son has done something so trivial and i take my stress and anger out on him by yelling and i hate myself for it. this is not me and i want to be myself again :( ive never been so negative in my life. my poor hubby cops it from me too and honestly i dont know why he stays with me. i want to be me again. i have gained 15-20kgs since having my daughter ontop of baby weight because we were housebound for the first 5 months (her dramatic cry would make me anxious when it shouldnt have) and now i still cant have an hour to myself to go to gym because no one can calm her down.not even her own dad.every night i have to retire to bed with her because she wont sleep without me right beside her. im drained.im getting worse.but i feel so anxious and scared to talk to a doctor about it.stupid i know!! i really need to because im not parenting like i used to. this mental thing is making me into a monster

Hi guys,

I had a breakthrough moment just now that I'd like to share with you; sitting on my swing under the shade of my almond tree. You see, I've never really conformed to many things. Actually, it's more of a battle to try and conform - I see things differently. I have never really fit or gelled with a majority of social circles (probably all of them, truth be told) - forever the outsider looking in: Why then, is it so difficult for me to follow the same pathway of thinking that most people do, especially now with the dark times I've had/am fighting to overcome? 
So I reflected on that question.. 

I came up with this..

Until recently, I had thought that there were only two types of mental illness that affected me; depression and anxiety. So when I have read posts expounding on and pin pointing mental illness; major depression, bipolar disorder, cyclothymic and dysthymic disorders, and BPD (borderline personality disorder), social anxiety, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) - it would trigger an emotive reaction. Acceptance has been a big issue with me from the onset. I couldn't get my head around the clinical terms. I understand the reasoning behind why they are used and I understand some people take comfort in that. I don't want to. 

So in light of this, I am re-discovering not only who I am, but WHY I am who I am. Essentially, I don't do what most people do, so I asked myself; why label myself with clinical names? I'm going to fight it anyways so I asked myself 3 questions: What way or thinking path can I take on board that will allow me to accept what I have? How can I cope with having it? and how can I overcome it? 

""Avoiding suicidal thoughts or intent"", is a thread in here and Tony WK made reference to 'The Black Dog'; never heard of it before so I researched it. The penny dropped. At this point in my journey animals are my solace; they help me with being mindful; they help calm me - one of them is my dog. 
I made the correlation. 
Being labeled in clinical terms distress me - I can't afford to be stressed right now. 
I can identify with animals; the black dog, whilst a metaphor for what I suffer - is still an animal. So, black dog it is. Acceptance. This was big for me.

When I now perceive the black dog lurking near me, trying to snap at my heels; I'm going to tell myself -it's just a dog. I refuse to give it the power to become something greater than what it is and I don't care what it takes; I'll make the bastard heel.

Hey guys. 
Does anyone else experience major mood swings, like sometimes so aggressive they have to be acted out in forms of breaking things and screaming, or completely breaking apart and crying uncontrollably, and then sometimes the thoughts and feelings alone are so overwhelming you just sit there and completely shut down staring blankly almost like you're stuck in a trance and all you can think and feel are these major emotions (negative ones) taking over your whole body and make you wonder why you exist and how you even do? 
I have suffered with depression and anxiety for what has been diagnosed, 7 years, though it surely backtracks further. I am medicated and see my doctor regularly though I can't stand counselling or talking therapies. I feel like I can't even explain it unless I'm writing it down, otherwise it's just mumbled words or sentences that don't make sense even to myself when they are spoken.
and then some days are completely fine and you feel genuinely happy and confident in yourself who you are and what you have gone through along with what you want to achieve in life and work productively to do that until the next day when you may explode in a rage or fall in a crying heap just because you woke up in the morning or something completely tiny went not as planned  
I'm not sure what steps to take anymore, I just try to remain strong and I try to hold on to that happy carefree person I feel slip away at any given moment. It feels out of body, like I can see my own exists me and every behaviour from some upward point of view like it isn't even really me. Have my issues developed into something more? It's only been the last year or so that I have noticed these things and they increase and decrease dramatically and interfere with my life in almost every way possible. Work. Family. Relationship. Friendships. Everything seems to be affected. Someone please tell me they know what I'm talking about

Hi Guy/Gals,
Since I was 16 (now 21) I have felt a constant sadness in the background, even though I could be happy and everything is fine.
A presence that follows me around and eventually it makes my heart feel heavy, I feel tied, I can't look people in the eye anymore and I just want to be alone.
I can't run from it, I can't remove it but I can temporarily forget about it, by separating sad and negative feelings from good feelings. But only for a while then like water blocked by an obstacle it finds its way around and I feel down.
When I feel this way it can get quite intense and I get this sweet urge that the only way to get of this quick would be to end it all quickly and it would be all over.
Is this normal? Should I not be worried about it, I tried using marijuana once when I felt down but this only made things worse with the whole ""what goes up must come down"" concept.
I have thought about going to a GP about it but I don't want any kind of mental health problem on my medical history as it may effect me later on life, career wise.
Any advice/thoughts would be wonderful on what I should do or what's going on. 
Thanks, Jack.

I had severe depression for years and moving back up with my family helped heaps i was starting to get happy, and all of a sudden i had a relapse for no reason that i can pin, and since then i have finally got my own place and moved out of home and i love living out of home, but its a lot more expensive than i first thought, the bills are quickly piling up, im hating work more than ever, i had to sell my car due to not having money for rego, and since i have been driving my friends car (who lives with us in a house of 6 low income people) we are all like family and i love them all to death, and the other day the gearbox went in my friends car so now we have no transport in a house of 6, so every day things like getting to work, doing groceries, putting pay in the bank etc is now really difficult as we live in a town without public transport... im just not sure how much more i can take, or if i can even keep fighting currently.... im sorry for the ramble i just needed to get it off my chest and my mind is very scattered at the moment so it might not make sense

Hello, me again.
So I find myself at end of the 4th day after effectively being dumped (I invested a lot of emotions into that one, even though it was short lived!) and having been on my own little self-built emotional rollercoaster, I am intensely bored. My unhealthy way of coping with the nightmare of having my idyllic dreams crash is to build up a new idyllic dream with someone else, but while I have to wait to find someone else to perpetuate this silly cycle, I am sitting around on my arse.
Okay, I'm being flippant about how I'm handling the whole dating thing, and am truthfully handling it with little more care than I'm portraying, but the point is when I'm not in a (possible) relationship, I am bored.
It's not like I don't have hobbies - I read, write, draw, photograph, run, cycle, swim, play clarinet, hike, walk, listen to music, ice skate, play tennis, cook, even study - but I feel so overwhelmingly bored that I just can't be bothered. I don't even feel sad. I just have no desire to do these things, even though I know I like doing them and get a sense of achievement. It just doesn't feel like the effort is worth it.
Still, I've learnt to recognise my downward spirals and in an effort to at least keep that at bay, I'm going to drag myself out for a run this afternoon and I'm posting here to make sure I actually do it. I went for a run a couple of days ago and that did nothing to stave off my boredom. It just made me bored and sore, haha.
But more importantly: what do you guys do to fight boredom?
James

I've had a rough year but so far I have manged to stay positive and get through each day. 
I am not sure what happened today, it was like a lightening bolt of emotion struck me. As I run with tears streaming down my face, I dropped to the grass and stared up at the Sky wishing I would just disappear or a giant hole would open up and swallow me. My heart hurts. 
Not sure why I am posting, guess I just want to know if this has happened to anyone else? Am I losing the plot?

Hi guys. I'm a parent of a daughter suffering from BPD, depression and anxiety.  Currently on meds, the 4th with great early results but now downhill. Been such a long road as many of you would have experienced. We are in this together but as a parent I'm currently struggling with some issues. Theres a fine line between letting her find herself socially and still putting rules in place. She is turning 17 next week.  Unfortunately my husband doesn't understand her mental issues, so I'm on my own with this . Just needing some advice...feeling like I'm walking on eggshells. I am new to this forum. 😊

Its one of those nights again, im sitting alone in bed in tears asking myself when was the last time I smiled or felt something other than this numbness and the truth is I honestly dont know but I know havent even laughed in years. I havent felt love or any sense of worth in what seems like forever.
Im in a relationship that I feel more disconnected from now then I ever have in our 8 years together. We do nothing but move backwards, we are in the same place we were 8 years ago except all attempts of communication, intimacy and affection are gone. All i have is happiness in my dreams, in made up situations with strangers there for me where no one else is.
 I have a family that doesnt care to see me in years let alone say hi or happy birthday. They have all left me to live elsewhere without looking back just like those I use to call my friends. The ones I use to message all the time with promises of catching up And yet I dont receive so much as a reply. I never thought Id be the girl with not 1 single friend in the world. I dont understand how I ever got here because I would and have given anything and everything to those I love and even to strangers in the hope that they could one day be there for me. They never were.
 I thought that starting a new job would make this all go away and while I love my job, I am again immediately ignored and disregarded by those I try to befriend with a friendly smile or hello. What is it about me that makes me so unapproachable, so difficult to love or even so much as aknowledge..
The only thing that used to work was weed but I have quit that for a long time now in the hope that it would make me stronger, make the bad things go away.. months later it only ever gets worse but the reality is that no drug can fix the pain I've felt for over 15 years, bandaids never fox our hurting.
 Talking to a councillor doesn't work, even they dont seem to care to listen, nothing they've ever said has helped. No one will ever understand how the world disregards me. 
While things for me will never change, maybe venting lifes problems here will help me feel something even if its just for a moment.
Wishing that i'll find something worth living for one day because I dont know how much longer wishing and hoping can go on.

I'm asking you. 
How many of you have depression but it isnt triggered by your sensitivity? Or is triggered by sensitivity.?
My depressive cycle has gone from 10 straight days (approx) every 8 weeks to a few hours now and then say every 3 weeks.  Improvement has come from correct diagnosis and medication.
However regardless of this change my sensitivity has been the common ground all my life. There has always been a trigger. What is the trigger in my case? Hurtful comments. These can come in the form of  eg - people saying accusing me of one or more of the following- being childish, thick minded (not getting what other perceive as obvious), being a little manic, saying the inappropriate thing, acting withdrawn, etc
At all times I've discovered through self observation, my trigger has involved another person or persons comments. And obviously 'they' cant all be wrong. My sensitivity is what has plummeted me into depression and it's so hard to overcome or rather its so uncomfortable.
So I was thinking, I can take an empty pill bottle and mark on it ""anti-sensitivity pills"" and put on a mask. Every time there is a gathering and I am hurt by comments I'll blurt out a fake laugh. When other realise I am not being sensitive ie that when their cutting comment doesnt hit home like they often do....I'll reach into my pocket and pull out that bottle and show them why they didnt succeed.
Such is my anger or contempt. for others that hurt me. I havent tried this but I think I will. I'm fed up. The alternative is hibernation and that hasnt worked only to a degree so I have semi withdrawn from people. Hiding away should not be the answer.
How many others have this sensitivity that is so fragile it takes you immediately into the dark place? And do you have a strategy in dealing with it.

For 20 years I have gone OK then crashed, just to go OK then crash again. It's been a long time and I am so sick of it. My family has had no stability, and I always think that I am failing them. They get their hopes up when things are good, so do I. But then I get sick again, most of the time resulting in a hospital admission, and I have to leave my children again. I just want a normal life, is that too much to ask. I see my psychiatrist each week and things have improved a lot over the years. But it's like I'm stuck now, I can't break this horrible cycle. The problem now is that I had to start homeschooling my 15 year old daughter, (who also has depression), I can't let her down. I thought I could get through any hard times with sheer determination and knowing that she needs me. Not so easy. I've been feeling really depressed again, not sleeping, too much thinking etc. but I can't let it get on top of me, I can't fail again. I can't do it to my daughter. I'm so scared. I don't know what to do. How do I fight a battle that I'm never going to win?

Hi,
This is my first post, i have suffered with mental health issues for many years and wanted to put some of it into words, and share it with you..
Sometimes I wonder, if as a female, it is within our nature
to have poor self esteem and body image, if we are genetically blessed, or
should I say cursed, with an over powering mind. A mind that allows us to do
some amazing and beautiful things, but at the same time causes us to spiral
around in circles. Over thinking, under thinking, over analysing, always
presuming that we know what is going on in other people’s minds. What if this
happens, then this happens, then they say this then they think that? 

Is this the way I was born? Is this the way I was brought
up, are these ideas that I have taken from people around me, from friends? Or
have I slowly been brain washed, by the power of technology, by television, by
social media, by newspapers and magazines. 

Has each and every day of my life slowly been grooming me to
think this way, to act this way. 

Does everyone think this way? Does everyone have these same
crazy thoughts that run through their head, and are some people able to just
let them wash by like a stream of water, whilst others get stuck in the rip
only to be pulled down deeper until someone or something can drag them out. 

This is sometimes what it feels like, that no matter what
you do, no matter how hard you try, you always seem to come back to that same
beach. To wade out into the same patch of water, beyond the red and yellow
flags. You always seem to get stuck in that same Rip. Each time to be dragged
out by that same familiar face and firm hand grip. Now you are safe again, your
thoughts seem calm and rational again, yet somehow when you are in the depths
of that ocean, you cannot seem to find your own way back to land.

It’s a tricky thing to manage and deal with mental health.
Sometimes you can feel as though you have the world at your fingertips, like
you have everything under control. And yet sometimes, this sense of control can
be gone within an instant, and you are left feeling small and powerless, with
barely even a warning. 

I guess what I have learnt is that although this
still happens, it becomes less frequent and each episode a little less
daunting. I guess knowing that you have experienced it all before, and most
likely to an even worse degree, it gives you the power to pull through the
other side quicker and more resiliently.
Thank you for reading this xo

Hi there world of BB. I have recently been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder, I have battled depression for most of my life and never had a clear answer until now. It has left me feeling like I am a burden, weak, angry, sad and generally unhappy. However, I now have a clear diagnosis and the path to recovery is already at hand. My psychologist has been amazing in helping me through this.
Any one else out there with this particular diagnosis? I am feeling alone and would like to connect with others like me to just talk about it.

What is wrong with me - am I stupid?  Do others find themselves automatically smiling and chatting away cheerily to others they've known for many years as if all is OK?  Or is it just me?
My oldest friend - since teenagers - we've shared so much over the decades - although not seeing each other in person much, don't even email very often - doesn't make any difference - she lives in another town - shared intimate conversations and supported each other thru  romances, marriages, divorces, love affairs, kids, jobs, even the same hobbies and interests - we were each other's bridesmaids -the lot!  Just pick up where we left off...easy like old slippers.
She rang yesterday out of the blue instead of emailing...""G'day"".  We chatted about our grown up kids, grandkids, the mutual hobby we both have and our plans for those activities - and not once did I say how bad the last few months had been re my anxiety, depression, indecision about quitting my job (hers is much more secure and due to a rich husband, has no money worries..half her luck!!)  worry about d.i.l's depression, son's unhappy marriage, my seeing a psych, crying all the time - not a word!  
 As far as she knows. when I hung up she'd obviously think ""Well Moon seems to be going along OK - good for her!""
Anyone know why I did this?   I trust her. I love her. I admire her.  I told her nothing!   Some ""friend"" aren't I?.....confused Moon S.

So I've had a really tough year with relationships that caused me earlier in the year to have 2 panic attacks. Since then i managed to get through my life pretty well but i always didn't feel right. I've had constant headaches plaguing me, with any type of pain relief not really helping. 

Over the past 4 weeks ive taken a turn for the worst, my headache won't stop, i got extremely tired and exhausted and I'm having painful stomach pains which i believe is my IBS. I recently switched to a new drug for depression but unsure if its helping or making me worse. I've had to take leave from work but im currently really struggling. I'm unsure if depression can cause this type of headache, as anyone else had troubles?

I feel like my body has just given up caring because i always seem to have this headache its making my day to day life impossible. I can't enjoy playing video games, and even playing board games is hard. I need to be able to concentrate and think. I understand with depression and anxiety you should be going out enjoying the things you can, but how can i when i feel this sick.

If anybody has any ideas what to do please provide them, I'm really starting to lose this battle.

I thought I was strong enough to fight bipolar

I went to QLD for a moth to visit family. on the plane was a semi nightmare but a few relaxing pills & vodka on a empty tummy had me breathing in a bag

Day 2 I went on a high. Every day I did something. My husband thought I was amazing as I did things I'm normally scared of. Thinking bout it now swimming with tiger sharks what the hell

But after the high comes the low. Last week I started to hate leaving the house. I canceled going out. I would just lock myself in the room for hours
We went away for a weekend with his family. Well I cracked. I hated it! So loud so talked at!!! Zero organisation and no one listened to me

He's family then started talking about Tv Shows with people with Bipolar & laughing about it and how crazy they are. I went into my room and didn't come out nor eat for 2 days. I just broke down. The day we left I didn't even say buy to them. 

My husband and I went further up north to our dream holiday. I was an anxious mess. I could only have 3 mouths of food a day & was throwing it up  & zero sleep. Every day we where out in the water outside my comfort zone and I was on a low. I just felt myself getting smaller and smaller and the panic attacks started settling in
The night before we flew I lost it big time. I was not flying because in my mind we where going to die! My husband rented us out a car to drive from the GBR to VIC. We went the inland way. end of the day in a gas station in central QLD I passed out. I woke back up and the workers called an ambulance. I was in and out of it & had pins and needles to my elbows & couldn't feel my legs & hardly breath. I was rushed to hospital to find out it was a panic attack. A panic attack caused me to pass out

The next day my husband took us costal way back to our family. He booked a plane for both of us. got to the airport high of my face and yes started seeing black again. I trained it home. 

I'm now home & on bed rest. Im completely broken. I feel worthless & like a joke. Im over having to explain my illness. Im over my husband getting texted by his family saying poor him.I know poor him. I hate myself everyday being married to him because of who I am. I offer every week that he can leave me. Now I live with the knowledge his family thinks I make his life a living a hell. I don't want to make his life hell. I love him so much. Sometimes I think it's better if I just end my life so he has to move on

Hi anyone and everyone,
I'm new to the site but definitely need to be here. I've been suffering from anxiety and depression this time round for the past 4 months. My marriage broke down late 2015 and I moved from the family home, I was happy with the decision and possibly the happiest I have been in a very long time, my how times have changed. My trigger has been hair loss, my hair has been falling out noticeably and rapidly since last year - doctors put it down to stress from my change of life circumstances. I have lost about 60% of my hair and this has sent me into a downward spiral of depression, that I feel like I cant get out of. At the moment I cry almost hourly and have a very unhealthy obsession with searching and researching and googling and youtube-ing Hair Loss, Head Shaving and bald women. Before this bout I was so happy, happy with myself, my appearance and my life - now I don't know how Ill keep going or if I even want to - I find nothing enjoyable at the moment just stressful and difficult even the simple things like school pick up and groceries I find an uphill battle.
I've made an appointment to see my GP (again) but this time to talk about medication, I think the onslaught of negative feelings and thoughts have effected my hormones and digestion and inturn caused massive skin breakouts also - adding to my despair over my appearance. Many friends have tried to reach out but I have completely dropped out of the social scene and cant bare to look at Facebook - I know people are worried about me and they have reason to be but I don't know what to do to get back on track. My obsessive thoughts about my hair means I sit at home most every day online or walking between bathrooms and mirrors to look at my hair. Its no way to live - I'm considering just shaving it off completely but am so worried about everyones reactions and the ""Britney"" effect - lost her mind, shaved her head.
I don't know if this is a suitable post for this section so I apologise if its a bit brash or TMI. Hoping others are getting help and feeling well, hope to meet people around the forum.

So recently i havent understood why i have gotten so depressed. My partner says that he has noticed that was a lot happier before, but i hadnt even noticed my mood dropping. I want to understand why this has happened because i want to be happy again, it hurts being so sad. Some people are saying that its because of the weather constantly changing but mostly being cold, rainy and windy all the time. Others say it could possibly be the decrease in hours at work. but i dont know.

Hello everyone, I've looked through some posts and my heart breaks for the things you are all going through - i can empathise with many things. my long long story short is i dont know what to do from here.  
 I've been married nearly 21 years to an emotionally abusive and controling man. Then he switches and is lovely. five children from 9-20 (older one not at home anymore). youngest child has autism, second has GAD and has recently been accepted thru a hospital mental health plan and is also autism borderline. 17 year old has manjor anxiety and depression, seeing a pysch and on meds but quit year 12 a few months ago right before graduating and he is also agressive and  controntational towards younger kids so i often leave the house with them. he goes up and down. i know i have reached a point of almost breaking down a couple of times in the past but right now am at that point again. and can't hide it. i have no one to turn to, no friends. i know i have to do something but don't know what my next step is - so I've come here. I've had major sleep issues since last child was born and drugs for anti depressants or sleeping do not work. even at four times the dose. so im a zombie as well. I'm trying to do what's needed for the kids but I'm failing badly and can't put a face on anymore. have no cash - how do i see a pysch or someone for meds? i honestly do think i may have a disorder that needs medicating but can't figure out what's wrong with me or how to fix it - to stop the panic attacks and thoughts and depression. maybe just start with a gp?

I was looking at my first post here in August, and its still all the same or worse now.I don't think I've talked to a friend in all that time. I've achieved nothing except more debt.The impact of my life is so close to neglible it really doesn't matter.How long do I have to do this for? I keep thinking if we have euthanasia for physical pain that doesn't let up for years, why not mental? I figure ten years will most likely see my parents pass away and my child to be able to look after themselves as an adult. So that's my ten year plan that helps me through some nights.I'm sick of crying. I'm sick of not coping, I'm sick of life being so sh---y. It's not going to get better, month after month gets worse and worse.

Hi everyone, I am new here and I have been suffering from depression for a few years now. I have gone off my medication, thinking that I was finally well but it seems to have come back. I don't really want to go back on anti depressants, I'd like to try and fix this without it. I think it would be helpful to have someone to talk to when things get hard and to share ideas with. Is anyone interested in being a support buddy?

Hi all. I have recently got diagnosed with Bipolar. It's a complicated story but to sum it up I am not too sure if the diagnosis is correct. 6 months ago I was hospitalised due to a major manic episode with psychosis ( my first one ever to my experience and understanding of what it is), there they told me I was bipolar.. After spending a few months hospitalised, I fell down into a very deep depression, which I am only starting to get out of since I tried this new anti-psychotic medication. During the depression I went to hospital 2 other times, first because I got extremely anxious, waking up with panic attacks, not able to sit still, crying constantly etc. At the time I was under an anti psychotic and an antimanic. Under those meds I was a total zombi, I wasn't really there, according to people. Then I changed to an anti-depressant, which was very effective for a few years prior to the manic episode. However, I didn't do anything and my depression got so bad I had to leave my job and relocate to a city centre ( I was previously living and working remote for 4 years). I went back to the city and got hospitalised again due to having strong sucidal idealisation ( if I would have stay where I was any longer, even few days, I think I would have commit sucide). At that point I was feeling totally numb... even food tasted num... Anyway, at the hospital the psychiatrist there told me I am not bipolar and my main problem is depression. We changed the medication, which I am still taking. I have been under it for a few months now. It did help a little bit but did get me out of the severe depression. Anyway, recently went to see a new psychiatrist for ADD problems that I am suspecting and got out with a bipolar diagnosis and two other medications to take. One anti psychotic and a mood stabiliser. I started to take the antipsychotic which I found is helpful, but I am reluctant to take the mood stabiliser. I am not certain that I am bipolar due to the fact that I don't know if I have experienced previously manic episodes. I mean, when things are very good and I am happy, I am very happy and excited but I don't think it is to the point to become manic. I do experience emotions quite intensely and have always been told that I am very sensitive. Any thoughts? Suggestions? To help me out figure out if it is a true diagnosis or if it might just be depression? Thanks

My anxiety  seems to have turned into depression that I am not so familiar with.
  The past few weeks have had added major traumas/stressors -instead of panic, which I had to control to deal with them then and there I have profound sadness which is not like me. Not the ""me"" others know anyway.   I awake each morning with tears not far away and then they come almost straight after getting up. 
 I desperately want to ring a friend and say ""I am so depressed, I am so sad"".   The first thing they say is ""Why?"" and then try and cheer me out of it and begin telling me how THEY are!  I put on too good a front you see.  This is not the ""Moonstruck"" they have known for years , they just don't SEE me. 
 On ""R U OK"" day   no-one asked me!  Perhaps a good thing, because I would have told them and they'd have laughed and invited me over to the Club to cheer me up!
When someone takes the ultimate ""way out"", harms themselves, I won't use the ""S"" word in case my post won't appear or something , someone always says ""Why didn't he/she say something?  Why didn't they ask us for help? Why didn't they tell me, Why didn't I see the signs?"" I feel like yelling ""They DID ask for help, they DID give signs, they DID tell you, there were HEAPS of signs they were in serious trouble...and you Laughed, or brushed it off, or didn't take them seriously."".  
""You just couldn't believe such a lovely, capable, ""together"" person who was coping so well with the ups and downs of life, was TRYING to let you know, you just didn't hear them"".
Moderators I am not in danger of doing anything desperate today.  I would never leave such a legacy to my kids or grand-kids...just wanted to make a point...because I want to ring a friend and can already anticipate that they will simply not hear what I am saying.  I have an appt with psych tomorrow and have a similar worry that I appear so socially OK she won't ""get it"" either!   (my job and whole life journey has required me to be skilled socially and verbally eloquent with excellent communication skills..not always evident on here I realise.....but it does sabotage me a bit when I desperately need comforting)

I am new to this site and honestly didn't know anything like this existed. 
I was diagnosed with reactive depression a few years ago following a DV situation and have managed to keep things fairly under control but find myself having a flare up with no obvious trigger. It has only been a few days so far but I am already exhausted and it's starting to affect so many aspects of my life. The confusion at not knowing the trigger just adding to the angst.
Apart from the obvious wanting to cry from dawn to dusk, the anxiety I am experiencing whenever I have to leave the house is crippling and causing ongoing pain in my chest and stomach which is just adding to the despair. 
I am not able to have any time off work so I am hiding out in an office praying that nobody tries to talk to me, only venturing out when it's absolutely necessary. I don't feel comfortable talking to colleagues about what's going on (especially when I don't understand it myself) so I am feeling very alone and vulnerable at the moment. 
My GP isn't entirely helpful with mental health issues either so I find myself having to wait another two days until her colleague is working so I can see her and talk through my options this time around. In the meantime, I am very lucky to have a friend (also has mental health issues) who I have been able to talk things through with, although with it being a fairly new friendship, there is also the guilt of using this person as a bit of a ""crutch"" when we're still getting to know each other. 
Hopefully chatting to the GP gets me off to a good start and I can start moving on with things and functioning normally again.

About a month ago an opportunity for a promotion came up at work and I applied, I’d been doing plenty of things above my level, was working diligently all the time, so was fairly confident.  I duly applied, had the interview etc. and then a fortnight after found out I had succeeded…why should it have amazed me when I always knew…

I thought I would feel proud, successful, good about myself, for an instant as I was told I did, but by the time I was back at my desk there was nothing but sadness…I realised that, there is no one for me to share this good news with, no one to share in my success, no one who would have consoled me had the opposite occurred. I have all this success in my  career, yet nothing else, there is no one to go home to, I have all this money and nothing to do with it, no one to buy gifts or surprises for, to take on holiday….just left with the fear that I never will have anyone who really cares about me. 

At this time when I should be feeling up about myself, that my skills and abilities are recognised, I just feel what use are they, what is the point, why am I even bothering to succeed in this way or work so hard, I get nothing from it anymore, no one else benefits, it just denies other the opportunity - I reflected on another applicant who lost out because I won, he
has a wife and child on the way…how much more he needs the extra salary than I do…yet he has someone to console him in defeat…I would trade everything I have achieved in life for one moment of that, yet who can offer such an  exchange? 

I know others struggle to get or keep a job, here I am with a good one, vast resources…yet its still not enough…is there no limit to the emptiness one heart can hold?  I can tell these events are edging me back towards a depressive state, I've been there before for other reasons, yet how many more times can i find ways to soothe the different causes...I start to toy with the thought, perhaps 'tis better to reign.....  Has anyone else had such a situation, where their successes only embitter them more and lay bare critical absences? How did you deal with it etc.?

I get told this as I'm sure many of you do. But how can the way people treat me be all in my head? I've got some examples of this below but you don't have to read them. What I don't understand is when I see people get treated differently to me how am I supposed to reconcile this? This concept of me being paranoid doesn't help to calm my feelings of inadequacy when I am treated as lessor than others. 
 
I work for a cat rescue place so warned lots of cat content.
a few months ago my cat went missing. Rescue protocol is to make an online post on our forum requesting assistance, but this must come from a manager. I get no post and manager states ""some cats don't want to be found"". My cat is still missing. Others from same manager get posts and search parties and plenty of support, cats 99% of the time get found.
I bottle feed orphan kittens. I get no support, told they will most likely die, have to pay for my own vet care because I'm ""imagining problems"". Forced to move my kittens. Other bottle feeders, get support and receive fundraiser money to support their vet costs, get posts showing off their kittens on our shelter website.
I get warnings for using my phone at work, while others are talking with their partners on COMPANY phones, no warnings. I don't use my phone excessively.
there are countless other things that happen to me constantly. How am I supposed to stop feeling worthless if I'm treated as such?

I feel as though alot of my young adulthood I have spent at one time or another feeling alone and depressed.
I have been through relationship failures and have struggled with other relationship related loss.
I've always kept my problems to myself and have always had the mentality that dealing with personal problems should be faced alone, because I do not want to burden others with my issues and thought that it would also strengthen my character.
I find myself in my thirties and worried that I'll never find another lasting relationship or start a family that I have so longed for.
I do think that I have great qualities and am physically in great shape, but I'm struggling to see why I am the only one that thinks that this is the case.
I have dated people for short periods and it always seems like I'm putting in effort and it's never reciprocated. People just seem to loose interest? I know I have a great humorous personality and I'm not the clingy type. I'm very easy going and I just dont understand why men just don't see myself as having great potential.
I'm constantly over thinking situations and seem to be trapped in my own head.
I'm trying to remain positive by reminding myself that my situation isn't abnormal and I'm sure many others face bigger struggles than Im currently facing.
I feel a heavy sunken sadness that I cannot shake and suffer from sleeping issues because I can't stop over annalysing my life which keeps me awake at night. 
I do alot of shift work, so I'm finding myself sleeping too little at night and sleeping too much during the day.
There are times that I cannot get out of bed.
Not because I'm too tired, just because I don't feel like I can face the world feeling the way I do.
It takes a lengthy time to complete small tasks and I'm finding it hard to just do simple things like folding washing, cleaning my bedroom, going to the gym because it takes so much motivation.
I just feel like I get to a good place in my life and start feeling positive only to get knocked back down again.
I just don't know where I go from here?

hi, where do I start ? I a happily married guy with a great family that will be 56 next week. Sorry this may get a bit confusing but here goes.Things started to go wrong in October 2014 when I got sick on a cruise for our 30th wedding anniversary. In January 2015 I finally admitted to my family I needed help as I was in a black hole off depression, felt worthless was not interested in anything or anyone.I have been told that I contracted a virus that has managed to infiltrate the nervous system in the brain - but have no proof. We will touch on that shortlyI went to our local GP and was confirmed as being depressed, given an anti depressant tablets to take everyday and sent on my way.After about a week I was hit with bad headaches and buzzing / zinging noises in my ears, back to the doctors and he changed the tabs to another brand. Not long after this I developed a tic / twitch in the left arm and now in the neck.They did seem to help the mood a bit but there would always seem to be highs and lows over the following months.We were sent to psychologists and later to neuro specialists for brain scans , blood test MRI etc etc and they could find nothing wrong.I was put on medication by the last psychologist and that was so bad I was having suicide thoughts. So we quickly stopped them.Out of frustration my wife suggested acupuncture and no meds - this is where the virus was mentioned and was told to see a Chinese herbalist.This seemed to really work and the headaches decreased , the tic / twitch slowed dramatically and the mood improved. But it has never totally gone away and has gradually returned.Some days I want to sit in the corner and cry, and have had days when I wish the floor would just swallow me up - I suffer bad memory and confidence issues.Has anyone heard of this or suffering similar issues?Just wish life would get back to where it was. TWJ

This is going to sound absolutely horrible. But does anyone else feel even worse when someone else you know is unwell and gets lots of sympathy and attention from others? 
Normally this wouldn't bother me but since my depression has started spiralling, seeing others who are unwell getting sympathy and support from other people while i struggle silently is making me feel terrible and even more hopeless!
Am i a horrible person for saying this?? Does anyone else ever feel like this also?

Hi there. I am a 41f with a husband and 2 kids. I first sufferered depression due to a stressful job in my late 20s but didn't use medication and got better once i changed jobs. I then suffered from depression after the birth of my second child and have been on meds ever since. I rarely have relapses and when I do then the dr generally tries a new medication which seems to sort me out. I have been on medication now for 2 years and have been very well but just a few weeks ago I started to feel bad again - everyday has got worse and today I find myself curled up on the sofa crying. I don't know what's caused this - I am in a new job which is stressing me and I'm struggling with my weight so I know both those things arnt helping. I hate feeling this way- each day I wake up hoping I will feel brighter but I don't. I have a dr app this afternoon so will talk to dr but I get so embarrassed as I know i will start crying and I hate crying in front of people . I'm also anxious as I don't want to change medication as I have heard that's it's really hard to come off this particular one I'm on.Thanks for reading - just needed to share and I hate continually burdening my husband with it as he has issues too

Hi everyone, 

I've tried pursuing the same goal for two years now. Every time I try, I fail. And no matter how hard I try, I seem to fall. This led me to losing motivation in my job, and life in general. I find myself wanting to hide from everyone and everything.  I find it extremely hard because my partner is pursuing the same goals, and has succeeded. The only difference between us, is our circumstances. 

What are some things that you do/say to force yourself to keep going? How do you know if it will get better? And what if it doesn't?

Hello all,
It's been a while since I've posted on this forum. I found it to be such a lifeline when I can share my troubles with other likeminded people and not feel judged.
This time last year I went through a really bad case of anxiety and depression, which was triggered by job loss. I got a new job and whilst it was stressful it meant complete distraction from my deepest worries and allowed me to forget them and just focus on the day to day. I then decided to take some time out to travel as I was too exhausted from work. The two weeks leading up to my trip were so good and I was really happy, but I noticed I was really tired/lethargic as soon as I got to my first destination. This combined with headaches meant I isolated myself too much and began to dwell on all my deep seated fears and causes of sadness. I'm currently in transit (on my way to my next destination) and am locked in my hotel room crying. I'm so afraid of the anxiety and depression, it just seemed to come out of nowhere and take hold, sending my thoughts into a dark spiral. I just feel as though things are meaningless and I will never be able to lead a truely satisfying life. I feel badly about my appearance, my lack of accomplishments and most of all, my mental health issues, which scares me in that seemingly normal or even positive scenarios (i.e. travel) it just takes a hold and a I can't cope. I'm really reliant on my family as I love them so much and am unable to have a partner/kids of my own as dating is a real trigger. I really fear the ageing process as I don't want to lose them.
 Anyway, I helps so much to be able to get this of my chest. Is there anyone else out there who just gets completely overwhelmed at times by irrational thinking and the poison of anxiety and depression? If so, is there anything you do to help yourself cope?

So my second child is 10 months old. my oldest is 4 it took me 8 months to acknowledge I had a issue with my first child and the wheels started falling off this pregnancy at 28 weeks gestation.
i had been working permanent night shifts and I stopped sleeping.
tried to be proactive seeing Drs from 28 weeks starting antidepressants, stopped working the nights and seeing a Psycologist every 2 weeks  but now my baby is 10 months old I am almost ready to raise the white flag and give up.
i am on a new antidepressant and that medication is now under control by a psychiatrist.
i still have Psycologist I see every two weeks
money is now a issue I never get time away from my children as I can't afford to pay for them to be in care.
i was due to go back to work but work has changed its mind based on psychiatrist advice that I am not ready yet so I am off until July 2017.
i get no help from Centrelink due to husbands income so are sometimes left making the decision of if I go to a dr or not based on do I have the money to pay for more medications and out of pocket consultations  when we are currently budgeted to every last cent just paying the mortgage and other debts.
 what are free coping methods other PND mums use that I am not seeing.
i was doing mums and bubs exercise for a while until I had to drop that expense.

Hello, I don't know why I am here or how I got here but I have been told to talk to someone. I have been swimming around in a sea of regret and loss for some years now dealing with each problem as it came by drinking a little more each time. I have been aware of my consumption of alcohol but my family wasn't and needless to say it all became apparent recently.
I don't know how far my issues go back but I do know when things started to get a little pear shaped. 2010 my father passed away from cancer very rapidly. I had been working shift work at a brewery for twenty years at that stage. At the end of 2011 I took a redundancy and had a knee replacement that I needed and for the next 12 months I recovered and tried to get work which drained most of our redundancy money. I did manage to get a full time job just after that. It didn't pay much but it was money coming in. It also involved heavy lifting and loading and unloading vehicles by hand. I stuck with that job for just over two years and during that time my daughter tried to take her own life which turned our family upside down. After two years my other knee decided that was enough and I had to have surgery on that one too. We decided to sell our house of 14 years on the Gold Coast as we were struggling with repayments and massive credit card debt.
We moved to Bribie Island to be near my mother as she was unwell and wasn't taking good care of herself and took our daughter with us to change the environment she was living in also. It all seemed like a plan to help everyone. After a while I started my lawnmowing business as I couldn't get a job. My wife managed to get a full time job but she had to drive an hour each way daily. After six months my daughter decided to go back to the Gold Coast where she got a full time job and also after countless visits to the doctors and hospital my mother come good too.
We were there fourteen months when I had a heart attack, we decided then to move back to the Gold Coast to be with the rest of the family and try and start again. We have been here now for six months I have managed to get a part time job at a caravan park and my wife works full time from home. My drinking has slowly escalated over this time to a point where it has cost me and my wife socially. I have a lot of regret for the decisions I made over this time. We are both in our mid 50's have no home have no money other than weekly pays and nothing to show for years of hard work. Alcohol is a great sedative.

Hi, I'm posting this because I think I have depression rather than GAD that my psychologist diagnosed a few weeks ago, last night I was in a shipping center buy a b'day present for my girlfriend and I just broke down I keep breaking down for no known reason and cant stop crying when I do, is this normal form of depression ?, I have been so down of late and I cant seem to sleep at nights which is not helping either, my mind goes into overdrive, I went to the doctors this morning and he has prescribed another type of anti-depressant, I took some for about 1 month 2 months ago but stopped them as I felt they did not agree with me, the doctor has stated that if I don't get better in time I may need to be admitted to hospital with depression, I'm really down now and I'm find it hard to get the energy to go on, sorry if this is negative thread but its just how I feel, helpless and in a very dark place at the minute, thanks in advance for any works of strength you can give me through this hard time

I feel like I don't want to do life anymore. I just feel like I've had enough of myself and I just don't want to do it anymore. From the outside I have an amazing life..I am incredibly lucky and I know I am. I have a wonderful husband who seems to still adore me and 2 beautiful children. So why do I still feel like this? Why am I still going through the same thing over and over again? I have tried so many things...Im on medication which helps, I've tried therapy, exercise, eating better..I've even tried exploring my spirituality. What else can I do? I still wake up wanting to go right back to sleep again. I just long for the moment at the end of the day when I can climb into bed and fall asleep. I started a new job about a month ago and leading up to it it was so excited and motivated. I thought Finally I am back working full time since having the children, I will be busy and have a purpose and will feel like a contributing person of society. But to be honest, my job just requires me to sit at my desk all day with really very little to do I am embarrassed to say. I feel so useless..I feel out of place and it makes for a very long and drawn out day. I am struggling with the mundane routine that is getting up, rushing around like crazy trying to get myself and the kids ready before leaving the house, I am always running 10-20 minutes late..drive to school with arguing kids in the back. Drop them off. go to work. do not very much for 7 hours. pick the kids up. bath the kids. cook dinner. clean up. make sure there is clean clothes and lunches for tomorrow. go to bed finally. Alarm goes off and we do it all again until the weekend. then its cleaning the house. washing groceries and we're pretty much back to the beginning. In reality its all so normal and pretty perfect really, I knoe its not as bad as what it feels like at the time and if thats all I have to complain about..how lucky am I?! Why cant I learn to enjoy life for what it is. What is wrong with me? I am so consumed with my own self loathing and I cant snap out of it. I find it hard to be around people and can't even hold a proper conversation.

Hi there, 
This is my first post. I'm a 22yo female, previously diagnosed with GAD, depression, phobia (in 2013). I've managed to overcome a lot of my anxieties, mainly around eating in public and being looked at in general, but the last few months I've been feeling the depression come back.
 I work full time with children with special needs, I'm studying full time and have just changed institutions to do masters of teaching which now looks like a two year set back. No clue whether I'll enjoy high school teaching. I'm engaged to someone with their own depression and chronic pain/overstimulated pain sensors. I'm always there to listen and to cop his anger over his life, yet I have no one to tell that I'm struggling to make sense of what I want in life and feeling. I don't want to add more to his troubles.
I'm trying to find a psychologist in Adelaide, eastern suburbs. I just feel like I'm in a constant fog. I've recently started getting healthy and losing weight, which makes me happy but its never enough in my mind. I just don't want to be sad anymore.
 Thanks x

I am always bone tired, no energy to do anthing that I like doing or need to do. All my good energy gets used up at work being kind, caring and 'happy'. The well is dry by the time I get home. My kids are suffering from me being disengaged and are lazy and unhelpful because why shouldn't they be, what kind of role model am I? My housework is suffering and it just makes me more dispondent. I have all these good intentions and ideas going around in my head but I am just so tired. Blood tests are all normal. I am on medication but it doesn't help, never has. I have had depression to various degrees for 13 years. I used to be so organised, houseproud, go getter and enthusiastic about life. Now I just exist. I have done cognitive therapy and meditate sometimes and write in a journal sometimes too. I just can't seem to get out of this fatigued funk.

I have felt myself slipping for sometime now. Unfortunately this is part of the course of suffering from Bipolar. A few things have triggered this slip: relationship troubles with family members and friends, a sense of loss & being alone and lacking direction in my life. Today I feel really sad and can't seem to get out of bed even to do my beloved daily walk. I just want some respite from toxic relationships, negative feelings and some direction. Any constructive advice would be welcome.

Hi,
 I'm prompted to write due to a recent disclosure I made to a friend regarding my illness.  Just over three weeks ago I decided to let a friend in on my anguish just by discussions over lunch.  My intentions have always been clear, hiding my illness and people pleasing to cover up.  Not so long ago I noticed a decline in my mental health and I've made some changes necessary to help myself.  I feel hurt, confused and let down to say the least because I let a friend in on my illness and it has not been received very well.  I've always hidden beneath appearances ( not proud of it) when out with people I appear well dressed and my house is always kept  well and styled beautifully.  I mix in a circle of middle class Melbourne women most of which have husbands like mine in well paid careers. 
I don't know if there is room for my illness? Like it or not, I have it.  I revealed my illness because I was telling a friend I need to slow things down for my health.  She asked why? I don't know why I let her in on it but I really regret it because I feel she lacked any basic understanding or compassion, horrible experience.  Cutting a long story short, I feel this illness and any mental illness not just bipolar, is cruel and misunderstood.  The ignorance shown by my friend has left me gutted.  This is a woman who not so long ago commended me on my achievements, always came around with her kids for a swim, long BBQ's in summer by the pool offering compliments on my knack of entertaining and cooking.  
One week after I told her my history and that I've let some of my own care slide, she hops on social media insinuating via different memes etc about my particular illness.  Childish, cruel, ignorant behaviour I was not expecting left me feel cold, isolated and confused.  I hope she has not shared what I disclosed.  Ok, so a bit of a fall out, I'm a grown woman why does this bother me? It bothers me because no one with mental illness should have to hide, it's the worst outcome. 
How can a person go from being in my life for so long to just treating me like nothing? 
Thank you for listening.
Sharny.

Lots of 'low-level' frustrations in my life are contributing to feelings of disgust, disappointment and sadness. I'll try to list briefly. And whilst these issues in isolation are managable to overcome, I feel that everywhere i turn i'n faced with them, which has me feeling overwhelmed & hopeless. 
I had my first child 15mths ago. I've wanted another baby for almost a year. Hubby is beginning to agree that it's time for another baby, but doesn't seem enthusiastic about it, making me feel like i've beat him down. All my friends are trying too, so i feel pressure to compete (i have no idea why!) and also happy/sad feelings for my family & friends who have recently announced their pregnancies (4 close people around me). I wish it was us, yet I also have the feeling of cold feet & fear as we are finally getting more sleep (still deprived, but better) and I don't know what to do with my body. 
I used to be a gym junkie (which kept the blues at bay), but I feel frustrated that I can't find motivation to go to the gym. My husband has been amazing & taken i er cooking, but makes unhealthy food, despite my constant comments & requests (selfish, right?!), but I hate cooking, so i have to eat it. I have tried to eat healthy but my husband doesn't, and i just don't have the strength or willpower to continue, which makes me feel weak. I hate myself because I eat junk; I eat junk because I hate myself. I've expressed this to hubby (in tears) several times & asked for help. He says yes, then in the next breathe suggests KFC for dinner the next night!
I miss feeling fit & strong & happier.
 
Lastly, work. I returned in July & hate my job. I constantly feel like I'm drowning, yet instead of working harder to get on top of it, I distract myself with internet & drinking coffees because I feel so overwhelmed. I've asked for help but been told to work it out. I need this job for financial reasons & to get maternity leave again.
I find myself struggling to keep my frustrations & feelings of shitfulness to myself. Hubby has noticed & gets angry back, despite me telling him all of the above. He basically warned me not to get fired then retreats every night to his man cave shed & i waste every night staring at the tv or phone by myself feeling trapped & frustrated. 
I don't know how to solve these problems. Logically it's 'grow the hell up & deal with your shit. Stop slacking, get some willpower'  But I don't know how to  go from here to there (the way i used to be).

So I found out I could apply for remission of HECS debt due to special circumstances, mental health. I applied to 6 Universities and 4 Universities refunded a total of $27,800'of HECS debt. 2 Universities have refused to refund the last $16,000 so a law firm took my case pro bono and we are taking them to the AAT. After months of pain stakingly building a case and going over how pathetic my existence has been I was basically told today because my psychiatrist and psychologist wouldn't help and provide a report, money is more important after all, the case has nothing much to base on because well medical documents mean nothing, the department of education have now lawyer end up so my lawyer is expecting them to be ruthless. Gee, I feel like a useless, worthless piece of trash. Stupid me, I thought I had legal rights, but I don't, what a waste of time. Next time I think I have legal rights I'm going to lock myself in my room and drink u til the thought passes.

Hi all, 
This is my first post and I don't really know where to start. I was first diagnosed with depression when I was pregnant with my first child, 10 years ago. I believe however I have always had depression. I don't think it was particularly a natal thing. That just happened to be when it was diagnosed.
Over the years it seems to have become progressively worse. I have been on numerous medications but they only seem to be effective for a short time and then I need to go onto something else. I am frightened it is just a vicious downhill spiral. I have a loving family but I am afraid I am pushing them away. We have moved several times, trying different places to try to help me. This doesn't work, I can't escape my own head. 
I am self employed in a competitive, cut-throat industry and disappointments really knock me about these days. I have put a lot of my heart and soul into my work for 20 years but I am really suffering from burn-out now and I seem to have nothing to show for it. I don't have a saleable business and I have no super. I worry that I will become homeless and that my family will leave me. That might be an exaggeration and a figment of my own mental cloudiness but it feels like a very real scenario of where my future is headed. 
Over the last 15 years my husband has been made redundant twice. He has found it particularly difficult both times to find employment again. Age is not on his side and he feels it. He is very supportive but doesn't know what to do for me. My kids are also very supportive but they are young and I feel this is not a good thing, or a fair thing for them to endure. 
I hate the regime of testing a new drug and the associated therapy. It seems to work for a little while but has never had any long-term benefits. Each time I am back on the downward spiral, it's harder to come back. I feel like a petrie dish. I would love to be drug free and to just be able to manage this awful debilitating thing that is sucking the life out of me.

Hi
just wanted to share something positive that has/is helping me determine if my mind is playing tricks or not .
i watched the lastest in the hunger games movies recently and there is a scene in it were Peter ( recovering from being brainwashed and poisioned)  ask Katniss (who he loves but has been told in brainwashing not to trust) if she can help him trust her again by asking her questions when his mind is playing trick on him. The game is called real or not real I have adopted this whenever my mind tries to sabotage me into thinking my wife just puts up with me , it's working really well I just say things like ...""you think I'm weak and a bad dad ? "" REAL or NOT real .. She answered NOT real (phew) this answers my fears and it so quick there is no arguments 
 i encourage anyone who has not seen the movie to you tube it 
 
cheers

I was having a good day today - my day off work - when I got a text message from my supervisor.  I felt like he was accusing me without checking all the facts, so I wrote back, being somewhat defensive in the process.  Probably too much so.  As soon as I had done it I felt that, even though I was justified in my feelings, I had done the wrong thing, that I would regret it.  Then my supervisor called to talk to me about what I'd written.  And somehow, despite there being apologies, I still feel that I have been accused, that I get no points for trying, that I've let people down (again), and that I will never be able to do my job properly (or any other for that matter) no matter how hard I try.  And I feel upset that I put so much stock in how other people think of me.  Do you ever have those days where you don’t like the person you seem to be?  Where you feel guilty for your thoughts and feelings and opinions?  Where expressing them makes you feel worse rather than better?  Because you don’t feel you’re the type of person you SHOULD be.  And you realise how pathetic the self-pity party is but you can't seem to stop it.  I just want to be a person I can be proud of and I feel like I’m failing.  Today is not the darkest of days for me, but the stupid thoughts just won't quit.  They keep going round and round in my head and continue to make me feel cruddy, ruining my day.  And now I realise I'm rambling and ranting and I feel like I shouldn't be making a mountain out of a mole hill.  After all, there are way worse things happening in people's lives that make this look insignificant and ridiculous, right?  Never mind, just ignore me.

Hello everyone,
I have been dealing with depression since I was 11 or younger. I have severe anxiety, severe emetophobia, depression, and im an unstable and stressed first year uni student. But in all seriousness, I have maintained my strong persona and will for the better of my family as I am the only out of 3 kids that suffers bad mental illness and they are unsure of how to help or are uncomfortable about the subject and don't understand. I live away from home at my uni campus but travel home every 2 weeks as I get majorly home sick within a day. My friends don't really understand me either and tend to just say ""yeah that sucks"" to everything. I was great for a while during last term but began a relapse and i was praying it was not a full relapse but with the way I feel more recently, I knowit's here for a while. I just really want someone out there to say they know how I feel and that they understand that I need to cry 20 times a day, embarrassingly enough in public sometimes as it's too hard to keep together. I can't begin to think of suicide as my parents have spent all this effort on me and my mum's having a hard enough time with her family side that losing a child especially to mental illness would not be fair. So here I am, perservering, just trying to stay sane enough to survive enough to live.
 
Thanks for reading

Ive been depressed for almost 10 years now and its just so debilitating and exhausting. Some days and even weeks i'll feel good then it'll just hit me like a freight train I wont eat, I wont leave bed, I somehow manage to get up for work because its my only distraction.
Part of me wants to get help but I wouldnt know what to say or where to start and feel like id just be wasting their time with my sob stories.
My partner tells me I should see someone and to just snap out of it but its never that easy is it, and I feel that it puts such a strain on our relationship and I have to try and force myself to be happy sometimes, but most of the time I just wanna lay down in bed and cry until I fall asleep. Even now I feel awful typing this feeling like im wasting your time but this is the first time ive ever written my thoughts down and what comes to mind, thankfully ive never been suicidal but just over the feeling of darkness and misery that I feel all the time....:(

Hi, i have only just joined up on this forum, just wondering if i am alone, I am 52 so i think i am menopausal but i have just started a new job and moved to a new town a long way from my grown up children, i am feeling very lonely and depressed, I'm not sure that i am coping very well at work, i am missing my kids very much and every time i am alone all i want to do is cry or sleep, i hide this from everyone around me so no one really knows what i am feeling. 
I feel like i am empty on the inside, I am tired all the time, some nights i am awake half the night, i feel stupid at work and i feel that i am burdening my workmates because i can't do my job well. I have this voice in my head, that really hates me and at times just tells me that its probably not worth the trouble (I'm not suicidal, but sometimes it does seem and easy way out). I know that none of this makes sense but is there anyone out there that has these feelings too, is it menopause or depression?

Hi,
im not sure what's going on. I've always ""just got on with things"" but for some reason I'm struggling at the moment.
i constantly feel that I'm not good enough. I Feel awkward and uncomfortable around people and that they  are judging me (ironically the more that happens the more I start judging people in my head). I'm starting to isolate myself socially as I feel out of my depth. I never know what to say and have often gotten myself in trouble saying the wrong thing.
i have primary aged children who I adore (and are the highlight of my life). I'm trying to hide my issues from them but just feel so alone and sad.

This is the first time for me so please excuse any mistakes or even if I have the wrong forum.
I have suffered deep depression and high anxiety for over 60 years (completely hidden for over 45 of them), and I don't think I have ever been so down as I am at the moment.  This is just all too hard for me to deal with.
I have just had to admit my husband to a nursing home as I could not deal with the stress of his illness anymore.  He has Parkinson's disease and, as he aged, the more it progressed.  I promised him years ago that I would look after him until the day he died but, unfortunately, I have had to break that promise.  Now I live with the extreme guilt of that decision.
It just breaks my heart to visit him and tell him he can't come home.  It has been four weeks now and the pain is still there and nothing I do will make it stop.  My brain is racing with all the thoughts that come with the fact that I have let him down.
Everybody keeps telling me I have done the right thing and I have to think about my own health.  That is cold comfort when he was the very person who was there for me through many suicide attempts.  I couldn't even do that right as I stuffed them all up and alienated my children who just could not handle a mentally ill mother.  I still deeply love each one of them, but the mother child relationship is broken and I don't know how to fix that.
At first, my anxiety took over and I was too hyper to be depressed, but I knew it was there.  The blackness was still underneath me awaiting my fall. When I did crash, bed was my only comfort and, most days, that is where you will find me living on powdered milk and apples.
I am not a suicide risk at the moment as my husband needs me and I think I have to live to keep punishing myself for what I have done.
Oh, will the pain from my actions ever stop?  This is one of the hardest things I have ever had to deal with and I know he would never have done this to me.  He is a beautiful, gentle man who deserves better.
Thanks for listening.

Hi
 This is my first post on here so not really sure of what to write or whether I am posting in the right forum.
From what I have read amongst the forums there are a lot of people a lot worse of than me but just feel so alone and miserable 99% of the time.
Im 27, an electrician and run marathons for fun so would call myself a bit of a high achiever, which probably doesn't help my situation.
It all started back when ex gf started working FIFO 12 months ago, (we had been together 6 months when she decided to start that .) Ever since I have just felt so alone and as though i am watching my family and friends live there lives happily and I am watching it all through a window and feeling like I am just treading water going nowhere.
i know the relationship ending has had a big effect on my self esteem and feeling more alone that usual, but I have had these feelings a lot throughout my life and am just tired of the constant struggle.
I think being a high achiever sort of person nothing I do ever feels satisfying or good enough to me - like a day spent around the house watching movies etc feels like a waste of a day.
Guess the question I want to ask can anyone else out there relate to this???

So I ended up reaching out to friends: telling them how I haven't been coping, feeling sick all the time and generally being destructive towards everything. It felt like I started something. But as soon as that time passed where I was honest I started regretting it? All I could think of was the troubles my friends are going through and how it's now my fault they're worried about me on top of everything else... I started bottling everything again and just telling everyone I was fine but that relief I had for a while was gone.
Regardless I kept it up and sorted myself out to see a GP last week, was sent off for blood tests and given the mental health survey to do before my next app this Friday. I feel better for knowing I'm getting everything sorted. And obviously there is something wrong as my blood test results have come back with issues. But now it's just brought up more self doubt?

I've had this constant weight on my chest since last week, and for two days after my appointment I just felt on edge about everything. On the weekend I was freaking out over a party, even tried to self sabotage and get out of it but my friends insisted and even helped me get ready and made me look amazing and for the first time in a while I had fun going out? I felt ok about things, even though little moments still unnerved me but generally I was ok...
I even had some freelance work enquiries the last couple of days that have continued that moment of being ok.
I suppose what I'm trying to get across is there times when you do feel ok? But there's like a shadow or something in the corner of your mind that is a reminder? I feel so confused about everything. I keep feeling on edge and worried that I'm just weak? That my months of feeling horrible about everything and crying or being self destructive are all just me being weak and stupid and just failing at life and adulthood... Am I lying to myself reaching out? Do I even deserve the help?
I'm even more confused right now as I feel like I'm in this balancing act of saying I'm ok but then I'm worrying about this and getting upset?
I know I need to talk about this with my GP and I know it will be a discussion this Friday but right now all I can keep thinking of is do I deserve this help and if I'm slightly ok for a little while does that mean I'm just being stupid about everything... But if I leave it or turn back now will I just make it all worse...

Everything seems stressful at the moment. Getting out of bed, buying groceries, preparing food, doing dishes, being at work, looking at anything factual, going to bed... Any time I have to expend any effort, it's like a giant wave of ""please no, I can't"".
I haven't been getting enough sleep thanks to the effort of going to bed, but I have been doing some exercise tied in with going to/from work. Right now I should be making dinner with the groceries that it took me 2 days to go out and get, but it feels impossible even though the kitchen is just a few metres away.
I'm not sure if this is a depression or anxiety thing or what. I just really need to get a handle on it. It's not worth going to the GP and getting a psych referral, because I've heard that all before and know what I need to be doing but it's just too hard right now.

 I have no one to talk to. Sorry guys. I have had a bad GP apointment today. I just want someone to know I'm here. I'm fighting. I'm really sick today and its just difficult on your own sometimes.
I may be unwanted, discarded, up against more than I can handle alone but I'm still here for now and I just want someone to know I'm doing my best.

A procedure I use to try and get my head in the right place to be more productive, is to spend time using life planning tools to analyse my values, strengths, and opportunities to help me come up with long and short-term goals for the future.   As I get older these reassessments come to more and more of the same conclusions.  
My motivation has been very poor for quite some time.  Despite the logic established behind following my life paths I am quite unproductive because I cannot believe with sufficient force that my goals are worthwhile, or that they are achievable. 
What are some skills you use, or logic you follow to fight Depression and believe in your dreams?

I dont know what to say. I guess I feel uneasy in life. For years my moods have been all over the place; from overly happily and excited to ignorant, distant and cold. I have anxiety about communicating with people or what people think of me. I get stressed when people invite me to events that I know I will have to attend or 'should' attend and then the whole time leading up to it Im stressed, anxious and distant that it effects my work. I have been sent home, called in sick, and managed to gain a group of haters because of my moods and ""depressingness"".. The worst part is I am fully aware of all my potential and how great I am at my job, but I am soo unmotivated with EVERYTHING in life that I just don't apply myself. Nothing seems important enough to try. Im not motivated by money and although I like my job I still would rather lay in bed all day instead. I struggle to focus my thoughts on the good in the world when my perspective only sees hate. Things like war, poverty, animal cruelty, technology, government deception. Things like this cross my mind everyday and I wish for death away from this place of hate and greed. I feel trapped in a society/culture that I don't agree with. This makes it hard to fit in and feel accepted. Having noone to speak to, noone to turn to, noone who thinks like me, I turn to myself and unfortunately I am a horrible person. I have nothing nice to say about myself, I always judge myself and think the worst and sometimes I think I hear people talking about me when I know they are not.. that sounds weird but its really Fkd-up. I have kept a diary for a very long time and before that in my teen years I wrote letter. This does help but I dont do it as often and all I ever seem to write is miserable stuff. I have companions whom I love. I have always had some type of substance in my life. At one point it was meth, ectasy, alcohol, and marijuana. Currently I smoke weed and have found this to be the most stabilizing of them all but i dont promote it at all, infact I would reccommend otherwise. Unfortunately for me it helps me feel less. Which is my way of coping at the moment.I will refuse medications or pharmaceuticals and the doctors as they have been nothing but failures to me in my past experiences. My beliefs apose this industry and the community rules apose me for speaking in depth on this. Any ideas for feeling importance in life for daily activities? Or how to want to get out of bed each day.

Thought I'd better do an intro post. I'm a 50ish female who has battled depression for most of my life. Over the years I've had numerous psychiatrists and psychologists - none helped much. Medication makes me feel like I'm living in a bubble OR doesn't appear to do anything. I just can't win!
Most people are unaware of my depression - I've become a master at masking my feelings. The only ones who know me well are my animals. 
I've moved house from the city to a rural idyll to better accommodate my animals - I have horses and dogs. I've also just started seeing a new counsellor and she has given me some hope.....
I'm sorry if I'm rambling on.......... today is not one of my better days

I am getting desperate and have no idea what to do. My issue has been built up over 15-20 years of growing up and ruminating as an adult.
I want to proven wrong but unfortunately it never happens.
It is my belief that life is completely devoid of meaning. Objectively, there can literally not be meaning to anyone's life because there is no way to have lasting or significant impact. It is simply an issue of not having a viable option available. Subjectively, people can create their own meaning, but it is false and empty. Subjective meaning is an oxymoron because what I find meaningful may be completely meaningless to every other person, which by any measure is meaningless.
Anyway, I have raised this with friends and family and they simply shrug and make platitudes about their meaningless life and that they enjoy it.
I am sick of feeling bleak and listless. I have sought help but nothing has worked.
I live in a regional town and options are limited. I have seen a few gps but they are stretched and it doesn't seem like the forum to discuss big ideas. I have seen a psych who after two sessions could only offer the advice of writing a ""gratitude list"" and to find hobbies. She simply didn't understand the depth of what I was trying to tell her and that I was a ""bit upset about life"". I saw a councillor who literally told me he couldn't help me and to not come back. I am out of options in my local area. I also tried some meds but they made me feel worse.
I feel even worse now and that I am spiralling out of control because I don't even have the hope that treatment can help.
I've had blood tests (nothing to pin this on), I eat healthily, exercise regularly, am in a stable relationship, have stable employment, no financial issues, etc. My issue is the belief that life doesn't matter and don't care anymore. I actually think there isn't anything defective in my belief, but don't want to be sad about life anymore. I feel like I've woken up, seen the truth, and cannot unsee it.
Does anyone have any suggestions?

that feeling comes back again after i felt better for the last 2 years.
Loneliness and desperation. 
 I'm 35 yo female and have no friends, no partner and no children now.
After I talked to guy I was dating for the recent one year, I feel desperate again. He is not willing to buy a property with me and move forward. 
All my married friends are working together for a better life. But i have no one to rely on. Bank will only lend me 300k ish, which is not enough to buy property here.

Hi friends, this is my first post.I've recently been diagnosed bipolar 2 after years of depression treatment. Had a bit of a breakdown after a close family death and a family member with an ice addiction.I'm a subcontractor snake catcher and don't earn alot due to physical injury. In the middle of adjusting the bipolar meds and I'm a mess. But can't afford to see a psychiatrist at the moment. Just don't have the mental energy.I'm worried because I haven't put last years tax earnings in due to mental breakdown and falling off a roof and breaking a few ribs. Has anyone had a similar experience with their tax etc?Trying so hard not to just sit around and do nothing with my life, but all these things business owners have to do are closing in on me and I'm starting to panic. Psychologists I've seen have no idea what to do about this, so who do I see for help? I'm trying so hard to keep it together.Thankyou very much for reading

I am a 27 turning 28 next month and still wondering why I have never heard anyone say ""I understand you"" to me. every time there is something that I feel and see that is unfair for me, people always say their opinion but never saw where I am standing. 
I grew up from a small country with poor family. Never complained with anything i have had because i dont want my family  especially my parents to feel that what they did weren't enough. I worked and helped family after my studies; and even if while I was studying I do extra job to earn money for school and family too. I always help everyone who is in need as much as i could especially family. I saw how easy life was with other people while most of everything was a struggle. But then again, people that i love are my priority. It is very rare for me to say ""NO"" to anyone because I have had lot's of ""NO's"" in my life too. And that feeling wasn't pleasant. I grew up trying to understand everyone's needs and situation until now that i am married (3yrs). But I guess I have reached my end of understanding everyone, the end of giving without having in return. i never wished for material things but to hear and feel that someone understand.
Someone said I am naive. i give all i can even if i know i will not have anything left. I did this to myself. I have let myself feel like this.
Now I am feeling guilty that I am exoecting something in return. But is it wrong to care and understand everyone hoping someone, even just one from them will give the same thing even if i don't ask for it. Just as simple as ""i understand you"" response when I am feeling heavy.

Hi I'm new here and not sure if this is where i should post it or not,  but i feel lost, I'm not sure where i belong.  I'm a father of three gorgeous girls and a wife of 12yrs.
 I recently had a bad time at work,  getting picked on as a manager could never do the right thing, was always in trouble,  no friends,  everyone stabbed me in the back etc. I left to join Bunnings and for 4 months was good then i got fired for a minor incident.  Due to no income i was forced to return to my old job,  feeling like i let my family down so had to do the right thing and earn an income( sole income earner).
 I thought i was mentally tough and could handle it but recently I've just been feeling like I'm lost,  nothing goes the way i want it to, I'm getting emotional (admittedly I've had a couple of drinks).  I feel like i just want to be alone for a while with no one around.  I just can't be bothered with people at the moment even my wife and kids, it's making me angry and frustrated to be around others. 
 Some days are ok and in general work has been good considering,  but i just can't help feeling lost.  I'm not sure what to do,  I've always been a loner, able to entertain myself,  so I'm not sure if it's just a mood or something more.  
 Just hoping to get some answers.
 
Thanks
Aaron

Does anyone ever truly beat depression?
 I experience those ""waves"" my psychologist told me happens; waves of good and bad.  But it never gets easier, it always blindsides me and each time I'm left wondering how much strength is left in me actually.  The better you feel the worse it hits you, or the worse it seems anyway.  Even in the good days are not always good, it just a higher ratio of good to bad.
Just wondering I suppose...

Hi... I am 35 years old and I have been through tough 4 years. From my marriage ending, losing a baby, being first on the scene to a traffic accident where she died in front of me.... and through it all, I've managed to deal with it myself (and family support and a psychologist)My GP and Psych have been gently recommending anti-depressant medication to me for the last 9-12 months but my answer has always been no. I say no because I feel like I could do it myself and I didn't want to admit to being a failure, but also because my Aunty committed suicide when I was a kid.But... after having a breakdown again on the weekend (in front of my kids, no less), I'm starting to wonder if I do have a problem. I meet all of the depression criteria on your website. All of them.The thing is... I'm scared.Im scared that things will never get better, that people will see me differently because I'm admitting to being broken, that the medication will make me put on weight and not think clearly.... I'm scared that my life will never be good again.But I can't keep going how I have been. I'm losing friends, my business is suffering, my kids have now been I packed.i don't really know what I'm asking for... except for maybe some reassurance from others who remember that moment where they realised that they had been pushing the sh%t uphill for too long.my family and friends are all exhausted from my life and my inability to cope so I'm somewhat alone.... or that's how it feels. And I don't have any skill in coping with my anxiety productively when I'm alone. It all just comes undone.i get that I'm unwell. but I feel scared, alone and not sure how to help myself... but in a panic that it will never get better. Not sure if I should be relying on others for support or not.i just don't know anymore.

Hi all, I'm new to the forums even though I've been a frequent visitor to the BeyondBlue site, having used the online chat service numerous times. A bit of background. I'm 23 years of age, I'm a recent graduate from university and I'm currently working full-time. While I've lived much of my life in Sydney. I recently moved back in with the family who are in Sydney after spending 6 months Canberra. It's fair to say that I have a stable and safe home environment
Recently I've been suffering from poor mental health, which surfaced during my time in Canberra, during which I lived by myself. The main problem I have now is that I am unable to express any sense of gratitude or thankfulness for what I have as I focus on the have not's, especially when compared with other people. As a result, my current mood is that I'm quite negative, pessimistic and moody and all too often these days I get a serious case of the blues for no apparent reason. I'll just wake up and feel bummed out or resentful and unhappy about the same old issues. I feel that this is preventing me from living the life I want to have.
My accomplishments now all feel very hollow to me. I graduated within 5 years from law school with a double degree, a D average in my Politics/Social Science studies, completed an extra-curricular program as part of my university degree (the university equivalent of the Duke of Edinburgh program in high schools) and secured a competitive graduate job in my second last semester, among other things but none of them make me feel proud of who I am anymore.
Also I started giving blood donations recently and 2 wks ago I gave plasma and even though I should feel good about the charitable contribution I've made and will continue to make (I intend on being a regular blood donor) I don't....I just dismiss it as ""just another thing that I do.""
I suppose I'd like to understand better why I'm unable to draw hope and inspiration from my previous accomplishments and what I currently have. Why do I incessantly focus only on what I don't have? It's obvious I don't value or cherish what I have and have done enough. I look back on my recent past through the lens of failure, not success (ie. I feel that I have this sense that I'm now scrambling to make up for lost time) But the thins I really want most right now are: 1) A healthy social life 2) Expanded Social Networks 3) A dating life/relationship experience.
Thanks all for reading this ramble of a post.

I’ve had multiple Psychiatrists diagnose me with PTSD and BPD. I always assumed
the BPD diagnosis wasn't accurate but only characteristics of my PTSD since I
do not have fear of abandonment issues. But I am now starting to realize I
have a pretty strong un-treated case of BPD and my extreme fear of commitment
could be a paradoxical symptom of abandonment fear. I never could get myself to that point
because I truly would rather be alone. But I have gone through some major life changes and it is clear to me now
I have BPD and I can’t live like this anymore. I have to get treatment. I'll start with this post and hopefully I'll get some support and direction.

After 10 solid years of severe commitment issues that wouldn't let me get close to anyone, I finally met a guy who was determined I was the love of his life and wasn’t going to get scared off easily. He treated like a goddess and never stopped looking at me with that
love, no matter how irrational my mood which broke down my walls. It really helped he lived as far as you
could possibly live from me on this planet. Fast forward 2 years and we are now engaged, we chose to live here in Australia instead of my county, the US.  

The move triggered my BPD. I have lived most of my life with this head of mine; I have developed coping mechanisms and build a support system that, in ways, enabled me.  But I left all that behind: my support system, identity, and
methods of coping, and I'm left with this head.  

I have to be honest; I hate myself 90% of the time. I have terrible mood swings: I get super excited about things and obsess about them, I get depressed and need to isolate, and I see the world in extremes, especially with those close to me, which makes
me go from “normal” to really angry in seconds which makes it difficult to make new friends and keep and maintain a solid
relationships.  And let’s get real, I have become a person I wouldn’t even want to be near: a negative, depressed, angry, dark
person.  

But now, I am away from everything I knew and loved, my family, my friends. I am left with this head of mine and it's constantly telling
me I am horrible and can’t be helped. I think maybe there are treatments out there; I have to believe that somehow,
all this pain, emptiness, anger and personal hate can go away. That I can let people in, actually in, and I can learn how to allow myself
to be happy and be me again.

Hi,
I have finally accepted that I need help with what I believe to be depression and anxiety. I have never spoken to anyone, friend, family or professional about the extent of my mental issues. I can't even really put it in to words myself, I just know what I feel and think and I know it's not right.
 I can't remember a time when I didn't feel this way, or when suicide wasn't in the back of my mind. I feel like as soon as I say the word suicide, I'm going to get committed. It comes in waves, at the most random of times, with no real trigger. Although the thought has crossed my mind many times, I have never acted on it and deep down I know that I would never be able to do it to my friends or family. But for the thoughts that go on inside my head, knowing there is a solution calms my mind down for a while.
I'm scared I will be told I'm over reacting. I'm scared I will be told I shouldn't feel this way because I have a good life. I know I have a good life, I know I have nothing to really complain about but my mind doesn't know that. 
I suppose I'm here because I need some encouragement and maybe some advice how I approach this with a GP. I want to get better, I know this is the right thing to do.

I'm really not sure where to start, all I know is I feel so alone, I have no one to talk to let alone anyone who understands even a miniscule amount of what it feels like to be stuck inside my head. I've had some form of depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember, even during my childhood. It feels overwhelming now, to the point I don't want to live like this anymore. I believe I may suffer from high functioning depression along with anxiety which means I have the ability to pretend I'm ok, really well. As I type this I'm sitting at work, at a job I hate so much that coming here each day makes me miserable but still, I put on the fake smile and get on with the day because I know it's what is expected of me and I also need to support my family financially. Underneath all of the fake-ness I'm screaming, my thoughts never stop and I have constant heart palpitations (anxiety caused I'm sure). I feel like a failure of a person, wife and mother even though I know I'm trying my best to hide the constant internal battle. The few times that it has surfaced has been met with confusion, judgement and such lack of support that it makes me feel worse. I have tried medications and therapy but nothing helps for very long and I always end up back in this deep pit of despair. I honestly don't know what to do anymore, I'm so lost...

Dear CommunityPlease help. I feel like I am sliding into a black hole. I am numb and withdrawn from society. I function and appear normal, I go to work smile at the customers then go home and hide. but inside I am crying out for real connection and understanding. I feel very alone. I feel embarrassed and a bit pathetic.  I feel like I have lost being able to connect and converse on a normal and meaningful level. If I do go out I sit alone and feel awkward. I am drifting into oblivion and it frightens me. Where can I go to reconnect and find a place where I feel accepted and welcome and to have something to contribute without being a burden, a victim or wallowing in self pity. I have felt like this for as long as I can remember - even as a kid. I want to be vibrant and a part of something bigger than these feelings of lack.

Hi Bloodstone here,
 I'm new to the forum. 46 years old, male. I really appreciate the shares. 
I would like to share alittle of my story.
I've had depression since I was small, about 5 or so. This was due to family difficulties. Teens were tough, due to family relations and no vent for my emotions.
Nervous breakdown with 18 years.
Depression and daily suicidal tendencies for the  next 20 years.
Then I went on meds, trying various one under the direction of my Psychiatrist. Changing after a few years to combat relapse.
I must say the medication really helped my confidence and enabled me to tackle bad habits and addiction.
I found that tackling depression and suicide, for me, was an all round approach. First I needed to live a lifestyle that included rest and play, meditation, reflection, counselling, medication, and reduced work hours.
Secondly I needed to address my addiction. This took about 10 years with help from self help groups and meds.
I have lowered my life and career expectations to match the reality of my illness.
I still have many dark times and depressive relapses. But when I'm really blue the fact that my lifestyle is healthy means I'm not starting at zero.
Thanks warm regards B.

I know I'm struggling to ask this in a sane manner, but I would really like to get opinions from other depression sufferers.
For a long time, in parallel to my depression I have suffered what I can only describe as constant frustration. It is an overall tension and has caused many physical symptoms like stress, migraines, high blood pressure yadda, yadda, etc. I've discussed it with psycho's in the past but never got close to an answer. They womble on about relaxation and meditation which fail for me. So here is the question to the community.
Do other people find themselves constantly frustrated and stressed to the point of physical stress symptoms, or even self harm? Does your depression drive you to panic and freak out at things normal people would not sweat? 
Yes I have read ""Don't sweat the small stuff"" but I do, and can't seem to shake it.
Do you? What do you do about it? Does anything work?
Thanks in advance.

I just dont know what to do anymore. I feel like I have no place in the world and I have come to the realisation that I will probably live a life unfulfilled, without having accomplished anything, let my family down and realise my biggest fear, being alone for the rest of my life (apart from immediate family) and even then I want them to hate me so bad that if I decide to move away, they would hate me enough that after time they would have it in them to leave me behind as well so I don't bring them down as well.
I have no goals I want to achieve. nothing that I really want to pursue and I have no idea how to find out, no motivation or drive to get anything done, or finish anything. I never finished my uni degree (commerce) because I hated it and felt like it was a useless degree (which I spent a good 6 years or so doing just to fail out because of mental health) that would only get me a job in an office which I would hate doing, do poorly at and hate myself more because of it. Even when I look for jobs or try to do anything productive its like a big cloud covers my head and I put things off longer than they should because I am nervous or something. I want to find fulfilment but my shortcomings and skewed view of the world messes everything up.
My friends don't need me anymore, unlike me they have moved on with their lives, most of them with significant others or with careers they want to do and have left me behind. E.g. I visited my friends a couple of weeks ago and all it did was make me depressed at how useless I am, and that no one will ever love me like they love each other and that finding comfort and love with another person is something that I am just not meant for and this hurts really deep.
I have a terrible self image because I have let myself lapse into my poorest stat of fitness of my entire life and I know I should change and do something but whats the point really, getting healthy won't fix any of my other problems that I have. I will still be the ugly, balding, boring, unfunny, untalented person with poor conversational skills I always have been. Also because I know I need a job, and I have tried sort of, with minimal effort without any reward for months now and I havn't got one, and I only started a TAFE course which I have just stopped doing because I dont like that either and cant be bothered putting any effort in and now my AUSTUDY has stopped and I dont know what to do again.
I see no path for me that will see life happiness

I'm 23. I've had a few relationships fall apart all for various reasons, I've fallen for toxic people who've completely destroyed me and turned off for basically the past 2 years. Recently met a girl, and suddenly felt okay again, all the typical depression bs went away and i was motivated to do things, spend time with her etc. I started seeing a future. Then as it goes (Ain't no fairytale story here boys and girls) she told me she still has feelings for someone else and would like to keep things between us just friends, as if we hadn't already gone way, way past that already. 

It's stupid, writing this out and reading it back I sound like an angsty teenager again. I don't know why, I can't figure it out but something, somewhere along the line has turned every single person I've ever been close with away. Friends, family and lovers. I haven't been happy since I was prepubescent, had a really rough rural australian upbringing, overweight and apathetic. I've lost it all, I'm fit and healthy, I have a job and I perform music but I don't care about them. I don't have anyone to talk to, to care for or just hug, every time I've felt loved it's been short and/or destructive. I'm unbelievably lonely and I've gotten really bloody good at hiding it.  I don't know why I'm even bothering writing this out, it's just made me face the fact and tear up like a sook. 

Im not sure what the point of this whole thing was either. Maybe it's just a journal entry that noone can find and be like ""Hey jack remember when you were a little bitch""

My schedule has been just wake up tired at 7:am get dressed, get to school, come home, do stuff on my computer to kill time and go back to sleep again. I don't keep track of the date or the month. Its either Monday - Sunday and its [year]. Don't have any outside hobbies due to most of what I'm interested in being not available where I live. I don't really have any plans for the future Job wise as I'm unremarkable at everything and I'm not passionate about anything. I also cant go the money route as my average grades completely tanked due to personal reasons. I'm barely scraping by at this point. I don't even know what I'm working towards. I'm also have ASD so I have to work twice as hard to get half as far and Most jobs are completely off the table. Ill also never have a relationship or life a full life because of it. I cant do a thing to change that by taking meds.

[MOD NOTE: Original title of this thread was ""I feel like this life is not for me""] 
 Hi
This is not a suicide thread the title is just the best description of how I truly feel today. 
 I've tried really hard to get better. I've seen doctors and shrinks, been on medication, confided in people and changed a few big things in my life that where dragging me down. 
 
Probably taking myself off my medication a few months ago was a bad idea. I have felt OK though up until these last few weeks. I'm just hoping some more good days come soon I do have very happy days but just none lately.
 
I just can't help but be upset about my own existence lately. It's just so frustrating having no choice in being born and having all these expectations put on you. I hardly ever take a day off work, I try so hard to be a good person and I never complain to anyone about how hard it is to be so miserable. But I just can't help hating my existence. I know there are people out there doing it worse and it breaks my heart that I can't give then my life. I would do it in a heartbeat because this life is so wasted on me. 
I know what I have to do and that's go back to the doctor and try some medication again. I will as soon as I can. I'm just hoping for some happier days soon where I'll feel more motivated to do so. Hopefully those days aren't too far off.
Times like these are so draining. Trying so hard to fix myself and ending up back here, always ending up here. I'm just so tired so many years spent like this. I'm tired of feeling so trapped. Living with this awful disease is so hard and I know one day it will be the death of me. 
Here's to better days soon I hope.
Thanks you for reading.

Hi, 
 I just wanted to put my thoughts out there. I'm a 29 year old Male. I've been dealing with depression since my early teens. I guess it started when I first realized that I wasn't attractive.. I was/am just an average looking guy.. nothing special. I just have never really figured out how to deal with this. I find now that it's gotten to the point where I stay inside as often as possible to avoid seeing happy couples, or even just women in general because if I see a girl I find attractive while I'm out.. my mind instantly goes straight in to the whole ""why even bother looking, she would never be interested in you.. no one ever will"" mode and then that's me done for the day. I'll spend the whole day hating myself and wishing I was someone else.. I don't even fantasize with my self included anymore because it just seems so unbelievable that any girl would find me attractive anymore.  I tried tinder and various online dating sites which were ok when I started back in my early 20s. Not many people used them as they do now so the people on there tended to be more serious about it. but now.. I think those kind of sites just don't work for average guys anymore.. now that EVERYONE is on them there's just way more ""better"" options for women now, so there's no need to settle with someone like me anymore. On top of all this I just feel guilty that my depression is because of such a stupid shallow reason. I want to be happy with myself.. but I don't ever see that happening. I feel resentment towards couples.. not them directly. but the fact that they have what I don't and wont. I know some people live quite happily alone for their lives, I am just struggling a little to accept that as my possible fate. Sorry for the ramble

 Life is hard. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for 14 years now but I've hit my hardest time yet. Severe anxiety and panic attacks forced me to stop working in Dec last year. After this, I found out my partner who is supporting me, has a hefty amount of debt. We are struggling just to buy enough groceries every fortnight, let alone seeing my psychiatrist or anything else for that matter.
 
I can't access disability because my partner earns too much. I can't get better... They think he has inflammatory arthritis too. He hates his job but to leave he needs a redundancy to pay off his debt. I feel so trapped and so useless, like I'm barely living and I'm not sure I want to continue fighting. I love my partner dearly after being with someone emotionally abusive previously and who left me for another woman. 
 
But the weight of everything is dragging me so far down and his debt makes me feel utterly trapped, with no end in sight. Like I can't live my life until this burden is lifted. 
 I'm so upset and I know he is too and it feels like life keeps kicking us down over and over again. 
I just have no idea what to do.. I need help but it seems to get it you have to be off the deep end and I don't want it to get to that.
What am I going to do? :(

Something that has come up recently in conversations for me is anger. There are so many resources regarding managing or controlling anger, or about what to do when it is visited upon you by others, but what about the matter of simply possessing it, and what it does to us? I have no trouble controlling anger in its outward expression. For me, that is the problem. I've spent so much time repressing it, it's on automatic mute. And do you know what that does? It burrows in and turns on me. I'm finding it's a huge catalyst for my depression, as it just skips the venting phase almost entirely and goes straight to self-destruction. I'm willing to bet I'm not the only one here that happens to.
My little epiphany a day or two ago was this: I have a right to my anger. We all do. There are things in everyday life that make us angry. There are huge and abnormal circumstances that cause us rage. Whether it's justified or not, we feel what we feel, but it's like any sort of expression of that these days is some kind of massive taboo. Of course I'm not endorsing taking it out on your loved ones, or beating up the guy who stuffs up your change at the servo. But I've found that just talking about it, so many people will laugh it off, or try to redirect it, or tell you to calm down, or it will be okay, and all that sort of stuff. At what point did we lose the right to express anger in any way whatsoever?
This thread is for us to discuss our anger. Vent. Talk about what really grinds our gears, and about any way in which anger has impacted our lives and our depression. To share ways we know of letting out our anger without hurting anyone. I could certainly use some advice on getting it out, and some help with getting out of that automatic habit of turning it in on myself. Anything you have to share on the subject, this is the place for it.

This is my first post ever on BB
 I suffer from chronic depression and I have turned to alcohol to self medicate although it is getting way out of hand now.
I am currently 25 and only on centrelink. I want to get into rehab but there is a long wait. All I seem to do these days is just be on my computer, drink way too much wine and putting every day of my life off. I am just hoping to talk to someone about this and what I could possibly do to better my life.
 I am desperate.
 
Thank you for reading, Jesse

Hi Community,
I have been suffering from poor sleep for years. Recently I have been diagnosed with depression and told that my sleep issues are as a result of the depression. I was also diagnosed with sleep apnoea which is well controlled with CPAP. Has anyone else been through this? Is it possible to have a decent/restful nights sleep with depression?  I feel like a zombie and the depression is getting hard to handle. Only 72 hours until my first psychiatrist session - not that i'm counting!!

I don't know who I am anymore or where I belong, it is only until you get to this point where you truly realise that the world is a big place and you in comparison are very small. 
I have gotten good at faking smiles and conversation and pretend I have so much life in me, where all I can truly feel (behind closed doors) is the life drain from me, sounds more intense when you write it down, don't get me wrong it isn't like I walk around sad all the times, there are times where I actual feel like I am there, present and happy, this may last a whole day or it could be hours... 

I don't have anyone to talk to, I have tried so hard, but I feel like I am constantly letting people down including myself. 
 I think this is the first time I have said this in a way where I now become instantly vulnerable, I never let myself get to that stage, always having walls up and only letting certain people see the real, deep me... But here we are... These words have been said and now I am weightless for the first time, maybe I don't need to change or find who I am, maybe if I keep letting my wall down slowly I might just find my way back to who I used to be.

This is my first time posting anything like this - I just am feeling lower each day / week / month / year.  Each year I think ""this is it"" and something good will happen. It doesn't. I feel like more things keep happening to me. I sometimes feel like I am just a lazy whinger, but other times I think that should one more thing happen, I won't be able to cope. I live in a constant angry, bitter state, I hear the news on TV and just think this world sucks.  My life hasn't been a hard one, but I have gone through a LOT in my 35 years and I'm angry that others don't haven't gone through what I have, yet they have everything I long for. I KNOW there are people going through WAY worse than I am, I shouldn't complain, I have a roof over my head, and food in my belly and a son I love. But I can't stop hating my life.  In a nutshell - my father died when I was 5 - I was bullied to the point of contemplating suicide in grade 8. They bashed me, spread rumours, and told me I was ""ugly, worthless, and nobody would ever want to be with me or marry me"" - we were homeless for 6 months after a con man took everything my mother had - I suffered anorexia for 2 years - I failed uni due to extreme anxiety - I suffered from a major health condition at 27 - Cushing's Disease, leading to 2 brain surgeries & 6 weeks of radiation - I know have a life-long medical condition requiring medication. I've had 2 miscarriages - My partner of 4 years broke up with me a week before my 30th birthday (after I thought he was going to propose) saying he was still not sure I was the ""the one""- we got back together 4 months later only for him to leave me again - I then found out I was pregnant & had a child - we tried to make it work but he abused me emotionally, continually breaking promises and getting drunk - now unable to have more children - partner is back with his married ex-girlfriend who I always felt like he was waiting to come back to him, which is why I was never ""the one"" for him.  I constantly am in tears, I feel so worthless.  I now overeat and use food as comfort, which, with my medical stuff, keeps me piling on weight. I feel ugly, worthless, and should I ever meet another man, I cannot give him children of his own.  All I ever wanted was a family, I see my friends with their husbands - they haven't gone through what I have. I really feel like I can't take any more - but question is this depression or just a big case of the ""feel sorry for myself"". I don't know what to do.

Hi! I am 33 & single. I own my own house. I own and operate a commercial cleaning business with my best friend. I love music, video games, 4wding and comedy. I love playing with my niece. I earn good money and life isn't too bad. I have reached an age where I can finally do whatever I want with no-one to stop me! I can finally get my bike license! I can finally plan out and write the album I have been envisioning for years! I can spend the night relaxing and playing games! Sounds pretty sweet huh?
I can't do any of these things, and I couldn't be more miserable. What frustrates me the most is that I'm not an idiot. I KNOW I am capable of doing the things I want to do but I can't make myself start! It's like I'm that scared of hard work or the possibility of failure that it is easier to just not try. If it stays on the list of things I know I COULD do if I WANTED to I haven’t failed!
Why don't I do it? Why don't I care? I'm not complaining I really want to know why I hold myself back. It's like I just don't care, but at the same time I am guilty as hell for not caring. All I want is to be left alone, and now I'm 33 and my life feels like an all you can eat buffet of hollow shit. I can sit around and do nothing as much as I want! And no-one can stop me! 
But that's the problem. Whenever I am at home, I wish I was out seeing friends, family, or trying something new. But if I am not home, I just wish I was home and start doing the maths in my head to figure out how long until I am home. When I get home, smoke some weed, and watch YouTube or tv repeats of a show I have seen literally hundreds of times and am bored out of my mind! I can't even commit to watching a good movie I haven't seen as that would take 2 whole hours! What a waste of time! I'll just spend that time watching MASH repeats instead. How ridiculous.
It feels like I'm missing out on something. Wasn't I supposed to be married with kids by now? Wasn't I supposed to have done the 'become an adult' thing I have been waiting for since I finished high school? 
I think I need help to snap out of this rut. I have tried many times to do it myself, and for a week or two it's great! Then it all turns back into shit. I need help to get through week 3 & 4. To get to week 20. To realise one day that I have no idea how long ago I lost count of how many weeks since I sorted out my life.
I don’t know why I posted this. I don't feel sad, I just wish I cared more. Does this post even make sense to anyone?

Hello,
I wanted to say prior to writing that I feel hesitant in joining up again because sometimes I'm not equipped at handing out advice or guidance to others and so I feel when I post that I could look like the post blurt lady that does not care about anyone else!! I can tell you I do, but rather I am thinking of how my reply might affect the other person to their posts particularly since I feel mental illness is a personal journey affecting people very differently and there is no one size fits all answer to lots of it.  That's how I've found my journey, trials, peaks, troughs and self testing different therapies etc.   Sometimes I feel even though I've had a long history of illness that I'm hesitant in giving advice so would like to just let the person know I am listening and care!
I've been off the forum for a month now due to my own decline.  This past week has seen a cognitive shift in my brain leaving me a bit shaky.  I've had morbid thoughts again and have not taken care of any of my own therapy apart from herbal remedies for 3 weeks.  It has impacted me greatly.  I've eaten wrong, been going to bed at 1am and then up at 5:30am, my meditation has been twice weekly instead of every day.  Last week my son heard me saying to myself I'm not worthy, he asked me why am I so hard on myself?  
At the moment I'm trying hard to stock up again on healthy food, yoga, meditation and exercise before I slid down the hill.  Recently I was awarded recognition for a family fete I organised for which the school made $10,000.  My contribution again toward being a decent human being.
After all the years of trying to show my children how functional I am, I've realised finally my brain can't cope and I've put my own family on dicey ground.  My son told me I don't need to prove anything, he is older now and I can't hide stressors from him.  I'm angry at myself because I can't keep up.  I've let everything slide to become what? A volunteer with passion.  
I'm angry that I can't get the courage to tell people I'm resigning next year because I suffer Bipolar and can't do it.  I received compliments for my efforts but those people don't know my inner battle.
I hate the way I'm 'planning' my exit speech already instead of just being able to tell them.  I mean just for the sake of my family the community can't be told of my mental illness.  It's like torture. 
Sorry for the destructive ramble. 
Sharny.

I just thought I'd do a relaxed post and ask how you're coping with depression and what things you're trying at the moment. 
I just finished ACT - Acceptance Commitment Therapy, a 12 week course, one day a week. It's been interesting. I kinda realise I can live with depression and anxiety and still live a fulfilling life. Now I'm like, oh uh what do I want to do!?!? As my Dr said I lack direction. I guess that's my next goal. 
How about you?

I have been seeing a shrink for many years and have been medicated for the last few years for major depression/dysthymia/anxiety, ptsd, etc.  For the last two years I have also been seeing a psychologist and have come a long way.
I am on two types of anti-depressants, we tried to reduce one of them earlier on in the year but I didn't cope to well so they were upped to the origianal dose agian.  This time we have tried to reduce the other ant-D and a bit slower but still with negative results.
I am feeling like a failure, I am so much better than I was a couple of years ago so thought I could cope with the reduction but no it doesn't seem to be working.
I go down hill with my depression and my coping abilities suffer too. 
I don't want to be on meds as they do affect my liver but I can't seem to cope without them.
Any feed back will be appreciated.

Just been on the phone: 30 minutes of questioning re depression symptoms and the last year.to cut a long story short claim paperwork for inability to work.Repeated the same questions as previously. How do you begin to describe how depression has impacted on you?thoughts of suicide?attemps? How worthless at times you feel? And then planting the seed that you are young enough to work? 53 and then wanting someone to touch base with you in that regard.
i spent 25 years working in Justice Department totally burnt out and then returned in casual capacity and the wheels well and truly fell off last year.Only now am I beginning to return to some sort of normality. But only at a fraction of my former self. I don't need the triggers, prompts to return to work. If I  could I would. A couple of driving trips to Melbourne stressed me out. Ended up going to bed @ 5:30 last night taking extra meds so I bombed out and 15 hours later stuffed.Every day is just a battle. I can only do a few things before it starts to take its toll mentally and physically. Sorry about the rant. As always blow things out of proportion.
cheers Len

Been requiring more sleep of late,
last night in bed by 6:00 pm and woke at 9:00 am tense and tired. Had a few good days as in I'm doing a lot more these days. Spent like 6 hours cleaning 2 cars from top to bottom yesterday and pulling out weeds and gardening for a few days before this. So sort of like doing a full day's work. But I have my moments and guess I always will. When my mood plumats I am at a bit of a loss. Felt a bit emotional yesterday as my eldest son rang and reminded me how far I, we had progressed in the space of a year. This time last year I was suicidal. I still have thoughts but I can dismiss them. Had a na na nap this arvo and trying to stay up till my wife gets home from work. Maybe watch the olympics if I can stay focused.
The past 3 nights I've gone to bed really early. It feels like in going downhill again.im realising that every day  will be a battle of some sort. Being here on beyond blue helps heaps.

I was just wondering if anyone could relate to this?
Sometimes I feel shrunken down inside my own head. Like I’m a small person using my own eyes as a window. Everything is disconnected, noise passes over my head.  Occurences of this are more frequent during bouts of depression.
I have anxiety, depression and ocd just for reference! 
Thanks xox

Not sure where I'm going with this post. I have both nothing to say yet so much to say at the same time. 
Just trying to figure out how to do this thing called life (which apparently I'm not very good at sometimes).
I haven't been feeling like myself for a little while now. I sort of felt ""dead"" (indifferent like just going through the motions) earlier this year. Then something snapped inside me, the floodgates opened and now I am feeling again but it's not exactly pleasant. Mostly just overwhelming sadness.
Anyway, I'm just putting one foot in front of the other right now. Not sure what else to do. It has been hard for me to accept that I'm struggling to cope. Early last year, I had so much energy and motivation. I was studying, working, volunteering, part of various student societies and joined a uni leadership program. Earlier this year, I was invited to join an academic program (separate to the units that I'm taking). 
But this year, I've been slack with the volunteering, which I feel lazy and guilty about not being as involved as last year. Also, I'm behind on the community activities for the leadership program.
The frustrating part is the black dog and I are very well acquainted. We have quite a history together. Last time, he had me suicidal but not to worry, I won that battle 😉
And I don't know, maybe it's silly but I thought that I had tamed (even ""conquered"" the black dog). But the sneaky little thing is yapping at my heels again. I think that's the part that bothers me most. It's like ""really?! Not this again?! Why?!!!!!"" 
So I'm just basically having a long whinge about ""why this again?""

I don't usually reach out like this because I'm a very secretive person, but I'm just so desperate right now. I've had severe depression for years now. I'm stuck in a real bad down time at the moment. I've been on medication for a while which has blunted my emotions and stopped my panic attacks. I can usually pick myself up, at least enough, after a week or so but this time it's just not faltering. I just can't bring myself to DO anything. I've tried making a schedule and just forcing myself but I just end up feeling even more empty and lost. I used to be so passionate about art and studying just for the fun of it. Nothing feels fun now, not even games, and I just sit here all day doing nothing. I don't know how to kick myself into action. Please, if anyone has any suggestions, I'd really appreciate it.

I'm off to the Dr on Monday. I need to start feeling better about myself!
i can't stop feeling like I'm worthless and useless. I can't stop crying that nothing seems to go right in life and fail at everything.
since moving from Sydney to Brisbane a few years ago, everything's gone wrong. From having two great jobs to not being able to get more than 7 interviews in 10mths with no success. I lost a baby at 14wks. I moved to a state where I didn't know a single soul other than my partner. Making friends as an adult is so so hard!! And it's so lonely.
we've now moved to Victoria, still no friends. Every time family are down I never get a call, text.. Nothing. I feel as though I mustn't be good enough to be around. Like I mustn't be an enjoyable person to be around. I just want to be included and thought of. Whenever I call family , I rarely get a hold of anyone and I don't get a return call. Fair enough if I had caused a problem or done something wrong to people, but I haven't. It feels like people were happy I moved away and now want nothing to do with me or can't be bothered.
I do have a beautiful 1yo daughter and I want to be a happy, positive influence on her.
i do work, other than that I lack time to have hobbies as my daughter is still so young. 
I feel so down all the time. if it wasn't for my daughter I really don't think I'd be here. I never get asked to come to functions, celebrations nothing. And I'm not a downer around people, I just want to be included.
i just don't know how to get out of this funk and stop feeling down and negative all the time. I'm over crying. I'm over hurting and stressing about things that I should just let go of. I want a positive outlook on life but nothing goes right or how it should be.
im worried about anti depressants and what the next step should be, but I can't keep crying day in day out. I'm over it. This can't be how life is meant to be, if it is.. It sucks!

Does anyone feel limited by their mental disorder? 

I have bipolar and feel very limited due to it. I find that I always need to be in my head when I'm with people so I act in a normal behaviour so they don't suspect I'm not well. I find when I'm going on a high or a low I tend to hide myself from people. Well actually on a high I just be friend strangers because I don't care what they think lol! 

I find that I'm struggling with work and the hours and that I'm not going to advance in it. I find myself taking lots of toilet breaks so I can breath. I'm worried if I do get a promotion I will snap and the be known as the girl with the mental illness. 

I find I can't have a hobby or study because I get so board and distracted easily. One day I want to plan events the next day I want to be a doctor. 

I'm just really over zero stability and having to really be in my head and watch all my steps making sure I'm healthy. I just wish I could live life with out this annoying thing.

So I dumped my fiancé 5 years ago now, we were together 4 years. Whenever we had problems he'd email his ex and tell her he wanted to sleep with her. He talked to her behind my back, he even opened fake email and MySpace accounts and told her he could talk to her from work so I wouldn't worry, that was after he promised me he'd never do anything intentionally to hurt me. Anyway, she had gotten married and obviously is divorced because they are now together. I'm happy for him and I'm so glad I walked away and left him when I did, he clearly wanted her all along. I was never good enough, didn't earn enough, didn't have a degree etc etc
now im feeling so so down, part of me feels I have a lot to offer, I mean he didn't want to break up with me, he said we were forever. Another huge part feels like a failure, I'm still single, overweight because of my meds, in debt, trapped and so frustrated. I feel I have nothing to offer, with my lack of career, money and mental health problems. I just wish I could get out of this city, I was happy and free living in Queensland. 
I just want my happy ending

Some guy elsewhere in this forum, asked the question ""How would we describe depression if it were a physical creature.
What a sensible question to ask.
The guy who asked, must be an intelligent guy, a guy with a future of success.
I can answer that question, but would first like to remind everyone that many famous
and successfull persons have experienced depression. (Burton and Taylor come to mind)
Indeed it seems likely that depression is a precursor to success, even to victory, in most dramatical terms.
The late Winston Churchill himself said he had been afflicted by deep depression for much of his life.
He called it Blackdog.
Therefore I will call it that too, when considering it as the ""physical creature"". Most human beings can relate to the dog, and will recognise the animal as being of varying temperament according to breed. The wolf is a dog, as is the dingo. Likewise the poodle, the pekinese and the labrador.
On the one hand, we have the wild feral destructive canine, whilst on the other we have the loveable domesticated pet.
Clearly therefore, depression can be represented by the dog.(Blackdog).
It is, all dogs, merged into one.
The loveable domesticated pet today, and a destructive feral  tomorrow. 
If you own a dog, you train it. If you do not do that it will not become the loveable domestic pet you may desire. It may become something different entirely. It will likely become a menace, in fact.
The first step in training the animal is to treat it in precisely the same way as you would like it to treat you.
That way, the dog will become your friend - and yes, blackdog can be that too.
In training your dog, you feed it morsels of reward, treats or titbits if you like, when it behaves/responds as you would like it to.
Blackdog is no different.
Returning to Winston Churchill, Did he win World War II ? No of course not, but he was a leader and inspirer amongst allies, perhaps guided by Blackdog, the friend.
Blackdog, is no longer my demon.
I might be again one day, and if it is, I'll just remove the cause, if I can.
My pain is now greatly reduced, because of that. I even jog a bit now, (when walking).
I have to, in order, to keep up with a friendly blackdog, which is running ahead of me. (metaphorically speaking) 
If it can be true in my case, Why not yours ?
Cheers,
Sea-n-sky.

I am a 38 Year old male who, over the years had had a great career and a very loving family. I have a young son and wife of whom i love dearly.Over the last week i have become very disinterested in anything including time with my son and as my wife puts it ""you are there but not present"". As this has happened i realised that this has happened quite a lot over the years and not knowing what was going on i put it down to being run down and after a couple of days i would start to bounce back.It has now been a week and my wife is now giving me what she calls ""tough love"" where she is avoiding me, not touching me and i am feeling really worthless to be honest. I have a business that involves a lot of clients and now i fear talking to anyone all the time so i avoid talking to anyone who may give me any news i cant handle.This is losing me business at the moment and my heart is constantly racing at a million miles an hour and my sleep is not getting me rested even though its about 8-9 hours a night. Since being married two years ago, i have missed spending time with my friends and socialising as my wife isn't as social as i and now i'm not sure if i do anymore either although i know how good it feels to talk with my friends if that makes sense?Im really worried as i don't drink often but when i have in the last 12 months i have binged and been ill for days afterward. My wife is also the type of person who may run in the other direction if things don't work for her (as it almost has in the past) and so i am constantly running on fear of failure, fatigue and worry about anything and everything and it's strange that i now see that after all these years that this is what it is....and it scares me.I'm not sure who i can talk to about this as that too scares the hell out of me and isolation and disconnection seems the only way my brain wants me to react to the world.If anyone can help me with getting an idea of what happens next please i would really appreciate it so i know it won't be too much. I have had issues in my younger years with addiction and i am concerned that with therapy that i have received never picked up that i may have been suffering from depression as this is how it felt then too (so could i be wrong?).

Hi Everybody,
I've had depression for 10 years. Lately things have been pretty intense for me. I've been having huge problems with my husband where I find I'm always angry or sad. I get so mad and worked up that I can't think straight. I then got a message from my ex and without thinking went and saw him. For the first time in a long time I felt good and happy.
I don't know what to do because whenever I'm with my husband or if I'm alone I always feel so worthless

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression 4 years ago. Recently I had a serious loss of a very close family member and a break up of a long term relationship which has pushed me over the edge. I started self harming. After this I was sent to the inpatient facility at melbourne clinic the 'general' ward but was told that I really shouldn't be there so came out after 4 days. 
 I see a psychologist every 2 weeks, I am on all sorts of medications and health products, I exercise and eat fairly sensible. (Yes, I sometimes overdo it on the alcohol but it makes me feel more me with all the medication.) I have tried meditation and still can't seem to calm myself down when I am depressed or having a panic attack
My parents keep on saying they want to see me try to get better - what more can I do, other options?

Hi there, 
I have recently started seeing a psychologist to help deal with the emotions I have experienced after a particularly painful break-up. It has been very helpful but in becoming more in tune with my emotions through these sessions, I have noticed a few things. Firstly I have noticed that I experience what I could only describe as 'highs' where I am completely satisfied with life, become extremely impulsive, spend a lot of money, have racing thoughts, am very productive and social, become even more loud and talkative than usual  (I am an extravert) and sleep very little. Following these episodes, which last anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks, I usually become extremely down, have negative thoughts, sleep poorly, and yeah just become all round depressed. Again this lasts for anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. 
My first depressive episode occurred when I was 15 (I am now nearly 20) and I have had these 'cycles' ever since although sometimes they are not as obvious and they are definitely much worse when I am experiencing severe emotional stress like I am now. 
In the past month a have experienced 2 highs and am now entering my 3rd low. 
My psychologist has been focussing very heavily on the break up but I would like to move away from that in my next session and explore these feelings further. 
Does this sound like bi polar? How do I talk about this with my health professional without him thinking that I am just matching symptoms in my head like a lot of people do when they Google their illnesses? Also if it is bi polar what can be done to treat it?
Regards,
Concerned

Does anyone else get really upset about the stigma with mental illness? 
Ive got Bipolar which the world calls the crazy gene. People use it left right and centre as an insult to payout on people. Like if a girls upset oh that chick is crazy she's bipolar. 
 
All the Facebook memes joking about it. ""I hate having bipolar it's fun!"" 
Even the movies. I was watching the Intern and the little girl dad is like your friend has so many moods she's bipolar and they all laugh like a happy family about it! 
Like it's a nightmare. I'm trying hard to accept it and let people know but once they hear Bipolar your crazy. The Stigma is set in. 
Today one of my close friends who knows I have bipolar started liking jokes about it so goodbye loser!

Hi this is quite difficult for me to post on here. Never really spoken about my issues but i guess this is the first step.
I wake up everyday with nothing to look forward to. I have no interests or hobbies anymore. Everything seems to be such an effort to do. I have this feeling of complete emptiness. I find it very difficult to make decisions and when I do finally make one is always the wrong one. I no longer see my friends and barely talk to me family. I rather be alone. I feel likeI have to be a different person around different people and situations. I get quite nervous just talking to people. I feel like I just wake up each day and go through the motions without any meaning. I no longer have the capacity to have feelings. I say and do things which are mean to those I supposedly love but I feel no remorse. I hate being like this. I spend most of my days in bed sleeping and staring blankly at the tv. Sometimes I watch for an hour or so then in an ad break cant even remember what i am watching.
Yes I am quite messed up, I know. Im just wondering if anyone has had similar things happen to them and could share with me.

Hi There,
I was diagnosed with depression and acute anxiety around 8 years ago and went on a course of medication for around 2-3 years after that. I also had counselling at that time and also a prolonged period of counselling when I again felt I had relapsed around 3 years ago. The desire was that I would be ""cured"" but as I am learning this is a life long challenge to be managed and even celebrated at what I am able to achieve. I'm currently under no direct treatment.
Its a stressful period in life as I have also in the past few months moved into an Executive position (at a good/supportive workplace) and as well my wife and I have three children (5, 2.5 and 1). 
 All the same lately I have found my motivation and general satisfaction with life to be up and down and in fact become more down - I have days like today where for someone who can be super productive and motivated I just cant be bothered being at work, and I know that if I have a day where I am slow it'll be fine, but I feel guilty.
I also feel guilty because, you know I am lucky enough to be educated, have skills that are employable, a beautiful family, but I feel this way and doubt that others understand fully.
I've never posted here before but have used BB resources before.
Thanks,
Ben

Nearly 2 years ago my wife left me and she has since divorced me. I had a mental breakdown and spent 6 weeks in various forms of rehab. The last 3 weeks of this was spent at SPP and j came out of there feeling on cloud nine. My wife has completely shut down on me and at no time did she show any care for my situation. My psychiatrist thought I may have Dysthymia, but this week after a lot of soul searching, I have come to realise that I really don't have any interests or things that I am truly passionate and expert about. I also cannot remember the last time I really enjoyed something properly, which leads me to think I have become Anhedonic. It's in my nature to want to know the reason why? My first thoughts are that it might be my medication. Has anybody had any experience with their anti-depressant medication, whilst stabilizing one's mood, perhaps diminishing their ability to see enjoyment in things.Thanks for taking the time to read my post.

Hi all, I've struggles with deppression on and off most of my life. My life looks great from the outside and is pretty good amazing husband and beautiful children. I have spent so much time forgetting my past and seemed successful till resently when it all came rushing back to my memory. After several attempts of talking to a GP, I have done it and booked counsellor appiontment. I am scaried for the first time telling my story to be face to face so venting here first. Hope that's okay. 
i apologies as it may not be coherent.just need to get it out of my head
Great childhood, loving parents life was good till one day in high school what seemed like a normal day changed in a split second. He pushed me up against the brick wall And my life changed forever, I was to scaried to speak up, grades dropped a teacher ask why I tried to explain I could see the frustration in her face and was told to speak to the counsellor if I have issues, he was less than helpful saying boys will be boys. I never talked about it again even though it continues for 2years. I turned to self harm and it seemed to help. I am not sure how or when but somewhere along the way i was able to live life and 'forget'.
faat forward 10 yrd and life was good I was pregnant with my second child I went for on appointment and was rushed to hospital as my baby was In danger he was born few hours later. I remember looking at the doctors rushing around with all types of equipment and feeling like a failure as a mother for not protecting my child. Since then I have been living the days struggling with depression on and off till a few months back j decided to see a GP. I become so scaried to say out loud I need help I lied and ended up sitting in my car wanting to self harm once again. Which throw me straight back to the days of needing self harm to survive the pain. 
Forgetting the past didn't work so now it's time to deal with it. Thanks so much for reading sorey it was so long.

Hi all,
I don't even know who to turn to anymore.  I told my partner I think I'm suffering from depression and he said I've just hit a rough patch. The problem is this rough patch has been going for close to two years.  I feel sad and cry all the time, have isolated myself from the few friends I had, don't want to talk to my family anymore and get no pleasure from doing anything.  I haven't held down a permanent job for this time because I get anxious when I go into jobs and can't handle any pressure.  So I quit.  I went to see a doctor and they said I was suffering 'the winter blues' I went to see a psychologist (I tried two) and neither of them were very helpful.  I really am at my wits end.  What is the next step from here? Has anyone faced similar hurdles when trying to get help and how did you overcome them?

Hi I am new here, after months ( honestly years) of refusing to accknowlege I may be  deppressed I thought I would give this a go. 
From the outside I am very lucky I have a wonderful husband, beautiful health children. A home and people around me that care about me. But for some reason I have this hole inside of me a place that makes me forget the happiness I should feel for my life. 
I feel guilty for feeling sad I have no right too. There are so many people who are doing it tough, they can find happiness why can't I? 
How easy it is to pretend everything is fine, the front/face I put on every day. While inside I am scaried sad lost. Why is it easier to continue to pretend, than try to understand what's going on inside my head. I am not sure why it is easier to write than ever utter a word.

Hi, 
I've been seeing a psychologist recently and although I find it useful I still find it hard to completely open up about howI feel and ask questions openly. It's in my nature to want to know the answer to every question I ask and so I tend to do my research online. However, there' s been one question I've found little information on. Depression has always been something I've battled with - more so in the past few months - and as much as it's consuming and distracting and I want nothing more than for it to disappear, I also find it comforting? Contradicting, I know. When I have good days I feel as if I shouldn't be and it's almost as if I'm waiting for the sadness to just settle back in. I know I should just 'enjoy it whilst it lasts' but It's so incredibly frustrating being in this frame of mind and I don't know if it's normal. When I'm okay i feel as if I've lied to my family and psychologist about how I feel when I'm bad and it makes me feel incredibly guilty, almost as if I faked the whole 'depression side of things (even though when I have bad days I know it can't be normal). I stuck between these two 'sides'. I know I need to get over it and just concentrate on getting better but i just can't. There's so much I don't understand and it consumes so much of my thoughts every second of the day. I feel as if I'm 2 different people fighting each other and accusing the other of being a liar. I don't know what to do anymore. It scares me that I feel comfort in my depression. 
I apologise if what I'm trying to say isn't clear, putting my feelings into words isn't my specialty. Hopefully someone will help me understand why I feel the way I do? 
Thank you.

Hi all,
I just need to vent, this has been eating at me...
I feel like a failure.. By that I mean, life. I'm 22 years old, having a hard time finding employment and suffering from BPD and anxiety. My anxiety has been through roof lately.. As I'm just constantly so stressed, I can't sleep at night, I hardly eat and I'm just driving myself crazy. :( I have debt (car loan) and rego (due in sept) to pay off that I'm struggling with because I can't find a job at the moment, I've been out of work for almost 8 months now. I'm constantly on the look out for new jobs, constantly applying to anything and everything I can that I'm qualified in or think I have a chance in. I keep on thinking to things like "" oh, if only I didn't stuff around at school"", or ""if only I stuck it out through my university degree"", I keep on dwelling on the ""what ifs"" which I know is no use doing.. Whats the point in crying over spilt milk, right? But I can't help it. I feel like a loser, I feel like I'm letting my husband down, my mum down and everyone else around me. I can't keep relying on my husband, I honestly feel like I am a burden to him, even though he tells me that it's all okay and he is there to help me no matter what. I still feel like a sh*tty person. I always feel like that. I see everyone else around me, have good jobs, pay off their cars, starting to buy a house, and then theres me. I'm just pathetic really. I want my husband to be able to save his money. Buy things for himself that he deserves, but he can't because he's too busy handling all my crap, and all my expenses, because I'm too stupid to find a job for myself! WHY ? :( 
Not really a cry for help or anything, I guess I'm just really upset, I'm stressed and I don't have anyone to really talk too about this stuff. It's hard, I feel like I'm the only one.. When there is probably 1000s of others going through the same thing right now, but I just feel so alone. :(
Thank you for taking your time out to read this xxxx 
I really do appreciate it xx

This is my first post. I read something on here last night from someone else who is Borderline and it was helpful, so...I thought to write too :) 
I'm not sure what to say. I'm a 40 year old man. I was diagnosed a few weeks ago. It was a complete shock to me. I've always considered myself to be pretty self aware, but suffering from addiction and trauma issues....which I guess I do, but this has helped me to make sense of the suicidality, the way I do relationships....the list could go on and on..... I'm seeing a psychologist and medicating for depression and anxiety and sleep issues. 
The first week I just wanted to die. I feel completely delegitimated as a human being. I had some big dreams and i feel like they're toast. I'm really struggling with the stigma stuff around this disorder- like once you've got it, that's kind of it as far as ever being taken seriously. So....who do I tell? Or more importantly who do i NOT tell? I've just kept it to close friends and family I'm still in touch with. Also how do people deal with the overlap between your crazy and other people's crazy? Cuz I had a horrible experience with an ex who lied and had affairs, only now they seem to think that they've got a free pass on everything because of this diagnosis :( 
I started to feel like I was finding my feet with it after a week or so, but then I had therapy on Tuesday and....I don't even know WHAT got triggered. Something. Next thing I knew I'd drunk a six pack. I want to find other ways of managing to sit with that experience of pain or the void in myself, but I honestly don't know how to handle it. I'm an experienced meditator.....but some days it just engulfs me. I used to be a heavy smoker and hard drug user and I'm totally off all that for more than a year now, so....that's something I guess. 
It would be great to hear a little from other people with this condition who might advise on what's been helpful for them. I thank you in advance for your time and look forward to developing a bit of a peer group here.

Hello! 
How's it going? Fine! Of course it is.

Of course it it.
Conceal, don't feel.
Don't let them know.
It's not going fine. Not at all.
For 13 years now, since I was 17 (you do the math), I have been using drugs, weed mostly, to suppress how I feel and to function generally.
I suffer from autism, as well as depression, I was diagnosed with the former about 5 years ago, and the latter, when I was around 12.
I have traveled around Australia, living in different cities, until settling in Brisbane, where I have been for the last 11 years. 
Don't come, it's a trap.
I had some treatment when I was an adolescent, such as counselling, as well as medication, but was to little avail.
Slowly, over the years, I have learned to cope with the feelings of self-hatred and general sadness by masking them with drugs and alcohol.
I have been doing this for, as I said, 13 years, and it has somewhat amplified the difficulty in socializing, and increased feelings of paranoia generally.
Also, it has cost thousands of dollars. Generally around $4,500 per year for your average Q-a-week smoker.
That's probably around $58,000 I have spent on weed in my life.
I mean, damn.
And it is detrimental to, like, doing stuff, you know. Other than smoking weed, and getting more weed to smoke. Perhaps putting something on to watch while you smoke weed.
Running out of weed and then stressin' about not having it, then having to go through the gauntlet of getting it, and then the cycle repeats.
And I'm afraid. Of a lot of things, like that nothing really matters because we're all going to die and be forgotten.
And even if we are remembered forever, the earth is swallowed by the sun, and that's it, everything we, and anyone ever, has ever done, has ever fought or died for, gone, boom, meaningless. Nothing remains of humanity but a few drifting satellites, some with golden records, ""Greetings from Earth"" it says, a brochure for a world that no longer exists.
And that's it for us.
So what's the point?

And on top of that, we could all be in a simulation.

Or this could all be in my head.

I think, therefore I am? Can I ever prove the existence of myself?

Please help me, I have been high for too long, and I'm scared of what is waiting for me when I come down.
How can I stop abusing drugs, get over my existential crisis, and generally be happy and get on with it? 
I want to let it go, but I don't know how to escape this kingdom of isolation I have crowned myself the queen of.

Up until this year I felt as though I had everything under control. Great family, solid support, great friends, the lot. 
Though a sufferer of deep depression I always managed to not destroy every part of who I am. I am naturally a very outgoing , bubbly, life of the party kind of a guy and this year that has been taken away from me.
This year my trauma is rampant, my depression has sky rocketed and I now suffer from anxiety  which is a new one to the mix. I have so many mixed emotions and I've been turned upside down.
I am not regularly unable to go to work at the last minute which is killing me and my finances. I hardly do any socialising and the activities I did regularly that were my life line I no longer live for or want. Worst of all my 2 year old son who I love and adore makes me realise how severe things have got. Even his smile and laugh can't break my darkness on the worst days which just breaks my heart.
With this post I wasn't sure what I was looking for. A place to air a snipet of what I am experiencing but a thread where I hope you can share your experiences or maybe a similar situations and what your doing to deal with it and tips I can use with my family

Hi,
I'm going to be honest I don't know how to go about this because I don't know whats wrong. 
So i havnt felt right for a while, I've always been happy and smiley and everyone came to me to feel better but lately I don't feel anything. I don't want to see anyone, or even get out of bed. most days I don't even get out of my pj's.
I've never felt so off and I'm scared, even writing this all I want to do is cry because I don't know whats going on with me. 
For the last three months I've been working from home because the company i work for got kicked out of their office. I was put under emmence pressure to get work done that was never used and they are behind on not only my pay but my super and my course fees (tafe course)
I think because I'm always at home it's putting stress on all of my relationships, especially my family. 
All these things are building up and getting to me, I feel like i have no one in my life which is ridiculous because I know I do!
The idea of looking for a new job terrifies me! Ive managed to get a few resumes out but it gives me anxiety just thinking about it.
Look I don't really know what I'm hoping to get from posting this, I think I just needed to get it all off my chest and maybe I'll feel better? However if anyone has any ideas on how I can shake this feeling I would be very grateful because I hate this version of me....I want to be the other me...the happy me!
Thanks

My name is Kad and I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder with anxiety due to a long battle of work place stress and bullying treatment.
 My life as I knew it has been totally destroyed and I have lost my desire to keep battling. I know friends, family and my doctors are trying to help but noone really knows the problems I am experiencing. When I try to explain what  I am actually going through it is hard. I blame myself for where I am because I didn't have the courage to tackle my problems at the time. I chose to ignore it and push on as I am embarrassed that I have been too weak to manage it.
 I am seeing a pshciatrist, pshcologist and my GP on a monthly basis but I leave with no real solutions just words. I know it is their job and they are trying but once I leave they don't think of me again until my next visit so its just like a vicious cycle and my depression is strangling me so tight I can't breathe.
 It has been two years and i constantly think about my toxic work environment and what if I hadnt gone there or if I had left when the stresses of it all became to much. Now I have permanent scars that no one can see but they are so deep it hurts all the time.
 I am so sad and alone all the time with no light at the end of my tunnel.
I don't know what benefit writing this has given me.
 Bye

When I had extreme mania, my state of mind reached another level.  The experience of euphoria still leaves me stunned to this day. My mind was unhealthy but the extreme state was so clear, it bought such clarity, I thought I had everything figured out with precision.  I'm lucky that I stayed safe, my turmoil stretched to ideas that were so illogical but I believed them.  I've never had extreme mania again, I get hypo mania and can manage it, its not as extreme yet still difficult. 
After this experience I found myself wanting to explore it with the psychiatrist over and again. I also saw the psychologist once a week just to tell her my inner thoughts, share and off load.  I started to feel once the down came I became very rigid, very fixed along with new symptoms.  I could not seem to or have the energy for grooming myself.  I remember yelling in fury at myself in the mirror and just how desperate that state of being was, how the illness ripped at my being.  I viewed myself unworthy, someone needing punishment and wondered if other people suffered to.  
This forum is a wonderful place for people to off load, even if they feel compelled to share because mental health is isolating. When I was at my worst I looked like any other middle class woman in Melbourne and I still do.  It makes me think, we pass people in our travels and never know their struggles if any.  Society places stereotypes on certain mental illness through media etc but until you've gone through the illness it will never be exactly how they depict it.  People can experience the illness differently as well.  One of my main reasons for not opening up to people in my circles is because of threats to my immediate sense of dignity. Call me a pessimist but I do feel people label once they have knowledge of something. That's a shame because I know that there are lots of kind people out there but the risk to self and family is too great.  Bipolar in media often gets shown as violent people, I know I'm not violent.  My struggle is inner. I am aware of the desperation of the illness though.   I remember searching shelves and book shops trying to identify with other peoples stories, support group seemed to hard, but I yearned to listen to others. 
I've come a long way in terms of putting myself out there so to speak.  5 years ago I would never have shared any of my journey on a board like this.  
Thank you for listening.

Hi. 
About 4 months ago i had a depression relapse after managing pretty well on medication for about 4 years.  This time i had a close friend to help me through. Unfortunately just last week this friend pulled away and said she needed to take a step back and put herself first. 
I Thought i had found a friend who understood my condition and how i was working through things with my therapist.  I guess i was wrong. She always sounded so supportive but i saw the signs a while back and my therapist convinced me it was in my head.
Had anyone had similar experiences?  What did you do?

I describe my heaviest time, the time when my illness was most severe.  A time when full blown mania struck and lifted me to euphoria, a state in which I felt like I was touching clouds.  An activation is how I remember, my senses reaching a level like never before.  At the same time there was a fierceness to my being that is hard to accept.  Suddenly, out of no where I feel forced by something, compelled to accomplish things in an absurd style, like an urgency but I don't understand who or what is pushing this urgency.  Mental illness is pushing me, Manic depressive, Bipolar.  I welcome guests into my home and entertain with a new baby on very little sleep, charged up and ready, ready for what though? At the time I never asked myself this, it was like my state wasn't apparent.  I somehow know though to 'cover up' to people how little sleep I'm having with a new baby, cover up that I've been up most of the night inbetween feeds sorting out what I know later as unnecessary items in the fridge, cupboards, ferociously running about in a state.  My euphoria keeps me feeling looked after, like the energy provides a wholesome state of being, it's beautiful in a sense. Little do I know the drop down from this height will be the biggest drop I've ever experienced.
I awake with feelings saturating me, feelings of absolute guilt.  Guilt in extreme that I deserve punishment, I'm caught in my own brain and no one around me see's it. They see a new mum coping with a well looked after bub, impeccable house and clean washing.  No one knows this mum is a tortured soul underneath.  I go into the back yard and sit in the winter sun.  I'm unable to wan't guests anymore, the once excited entertainer has lost her capability.  I just want my baby  boy and I and try will all my might to keep up appearances when people still visit.  I'm compelled to wear the same pants, the same shirt, it's like the illness wont let me change them for days on end, something takes away my personal appearance.   But as time goes by the clothing becomes a habit, some force keeps me. I have no energy, lethargy is like no other time in my life.  I've become homebound, exhausted and trapped venturing out only to health visits.One day I decide to make the easiest dish, spaghetti for my husband and I.  For some reason my brain can't cope. I cant put it together. Depressive side has won.  My mind starts giving messages that I'm linked to fraud somehow.  I start calling lawyers. 
This illness, cruel.

Hi everyone 
 I'm new here. I've being dealing with my anxiety and depression for the past few months. Addressing it for the first time. In retrospect I've struggled with this my whole life. It's hard to accept as I'm social and make people laugh a lot and always have felt pretty happy? And yet there is this thing underneath it all. I have always had anxiety attacks and low times here and there. 
 For the first time however it's been really hard to pick myself up. I'm so tired. I  physically feel like even sitting is hard. I can't stand it. I saw a doctor and am on a low dose anti depressant . I've being on 20mg for six years and now I'm up to 30mg. I was fine on 20mg but now it is upped I don't feel better. Actually I feel worse. I'm trying to exercise. I'm trying to study. I'm trying to meditate and think positive thoughts. I'm a practicing artist and I can't create much work.  Everything feels hard and nothing interests me. I don't want to burden my husband as we lost his dad to cancer 8 months ago and he hasn't being the best himself. He knows I'm sad and is supportive. I feel like I can't take care of him. It's an effort to do the laundry and clean the house. I'm about to do a prac with university and am so scared I will have no energy. 
Any advice? I feel so useless.

Hi, thank you for taking the time to read this.  I really appreciate it.  I'm feeling disappointed in myself due to self growth pursuits almost testing me.  Over the past two years I've taken on two positions voluntarily within one of my children's school and their sports club being Secretary and President.   Life is a balancing act, I never stop thinking about how others live, how they keep up with everything.  Life is incredibly busy between extra curricular activities, playing taxi here and there for the kids, housework, shopping, volunteering, supporting extended family, class room help etc etc. I should be able to cope right? I mean, it's life.  Well I've noticed just like the throws of this illness, that at certain points I cope better than others.  I continue to self evaluate what I achieve mainly to see how far I've come dealing with this illness.  I've got a large task ahead which I'm organising right now, I'm leading the event just like last year a fete/fun day. It's an enormous job for which I'm responsible for and I'm feeling a little jittery fitting it all in.   The benefits of this are that I'm constantly keeping in contact with people, I'm not shut off in any sense but my mind is over stimulated by it all right now.  I'm caught between loyalty and my own self awareness in looking out for myself.  My husband believes if I take a role next year that I should accept to step down and be a general helper instead of leading the events. He thinks I'm capable but if the stress peaks then why do it to myself.  Part of me resents my line of thinking, that I need to prove to the family that I can function at top level.  I see myself as a fraction of the women I once was when I worked in a corporate setting.  My husband tells me I have nothing to prove. He is inclined to push my creative side, I make jewellery mostly.  I've got to the point that I wan't to just accept that I'm getting older now and since a full fleged onset of the illness came on its changed things.  Even though my illness was there when I was working cbd as accountant, our lives were different then so I coped with it differently and only had myself and husband to look after.  In short, I'm sick of putting pressure on myself to prove to my family.  I try to achieve at a higher level and obviously it brings too much stress.  When will I ever find the right balance? Or is it that I've pressured myself because of fear that I'm a hopeless bipolar?

Hi this is my first post.Diagnosed 2010 bipolar II and been on meds from 2010-2016, came of meds slowly over six months and last meds was 8th January 2016. I completed DBT program as out patient over a one elyear period which finished March this year. I've been doing well but have noticed the past three months depression and anxiety creeping in. I've been practicing my DBT skills with full commitment and it helps with mild anxiety and functioning but find it does very little if anything to help pull me out of the depression and high anxiety levels. I've been pushing through with high hopes that I wouldn't need to consider meds again but reality may be that I may need meds again.I see a therapist regularly and tried natural herbal remedies but admitting I might need more is a hard pill to swallow. I have two children so this affects them too. I am very lucky to have an amazingly supportive hubby.I feel that no matter how committed I am to practicing DBT skills and mindfulness etc ....... I feel that there is a level of depression and high anxiety that is beyond my control .I get so confused because my hubby and two friends are the only ones who understand the medical side and mei cations for depression and anxiety and bi polar, most people I know think I should be able to fix it myself and that meds are unhealthy and not necessary and all psychological.i am finding so much stigma from family and friends and even in my own mind and still find it hard to accept.I am also wondering how much do people think where you live (environmentally) has a lot to do with it?Would love to hear ways that people have been able to accept their diagnosis and need to take meds long term?I need this for me and I my girls need me well too. I describe my mum as a raging alcoholic without the alcohol when I was a child and I don't want that for my kids . I'm not a rager but one cranky irritable bear right now :(

Its been 9 and a half hours since i finished my last drink at 3am. Im still in bed trying unsuccessfully to sleep of my raging hangover from lasts nights effort.
 I have made the decision. Thats it. No more. Now i just need to stick to it. Unlike the last kajillion times.
 I dont drink every day. For me its every second day. After all i need a day to recover from the previous night where i have completely written myself off.
Im the type of person who cant do moderation. I have no control over my drinking. Rather it controls me. When. How much. My actions while drunk. For me a sip = pass out drunk. 
My almost 2 year old boy is playing in the lounge room with his nan and i am disgusted with myself that im not there with him.
So much of my life has been missed because of my dependence and addiction. A lot is a blur. Even more is just missing.
I cant do this any more. I WONT do this any more.
 20.7.16 marks the begining of my sobriety.
Now i just need to do it.

Hey,
I'm 25, female, with major depression disorder/ eating disorder/ body dismorfier since I was 13. Does anyone else feel like you try so hard to get better and then fall straight back again? I was feeling better for afew months, but my beautiful nanna passed away suddenly a year ago and ever since I feel more lost than ever before. She was my family and I feel like something died in me too. 
Lately I cant stand looking in the mirror it makes me so angry at myself. I hate having a shower because I know the mirror will be there when I get out. I'm a fitness instructor and its impacted on my confidence to do my study/job.
I'm hoping someone knows these feelings and can give me some advice on how to get myself out of this black hole. 
xXx 💙💙

The above title is from a song I used to know...years ago...but I cannot remember who.   It seems to be playing in  my mind over and over and over.  I find some comfort in the fact that someone else actually felt/feels this way too.  Every day is a struggle for me to get through, I just feel exhausted all the time, my mind feels like a fog, even my speech is deteriorating in a weird way, I can't seem to speak properly.  I feel like just giving in and not bothering with anything anymore.  I have certainly lost my Love of Life....I can remember I was happy once and wonder how many other people are walking around, dragging themselves about...all pretending that nothing is wrong.  When I am around other people I forget how unhappy I am because their chatter is a distraction.  As is the TV, but then I switch that off and I can't even remember what I was watching.  I stumbled across this forum and find comfort in reading that other people are suffering too....

I don't know where to go or what to say or what to do anymore, i'm completely lost. I can't take it anymore, i have a family member who is going in for an operation next wk and so she will need looking after, so how am i meant to fill the requirements i have with centrelink and try and stay well enough to look for work and look after this family member, i've already got enough going on in my head.
I feel like bursting out into tears, i can't take it i'm lost at what to do next. Got no motivation, no drive anymore absolutely pathetic. All i want is a person to listen to me and to give me a hug and put their hand on my back to tell me it's going to be ok.
I feel so alone, so isolated. Even today at a group that i go to i felt all day i was ready to burst into tears. Just want to hit my life away because it's no life at all.I need company but i feel no one wants me or wants to hear from me, it's like they have no time for me feel like a piece of trash lying in the gutter just deteriorating away in the rain.
I just want to cry but the tears won't come, i can feel they are there but not in a position to be let out.
Can anyone provide company and a hug for me please, i really need it please.
Kind Regards
Chris

Hi guys,
Just popping in to meet & greet so to speak. Been some what apprehensive about posting so hope you all understand. I have suffered many many years of depression & anxiety which as you all would know can be really hard to manage on your own. In the last 3yrs or so my health has really suffered leaving me feeling isolated, terribly forgotten about,( well in my eyes) by health professionals & so on. As I write I am already judging myself & thinking I should just hush & get on with what life I've been dealt, there are those more in need etc so I shall start small maybe

It seems like when things start going right for once i get scared which sounds stupid (and i do think it is stupid but unfortunately its just how i react :( )

I have been feeling not to bad, prehaps on the well side, scary I know.
Last week I felt myself slipping again and have not recovered.
Two days after I felt myself starting to slide I began a reduction in meds, again, but this time a lot slower and the other anti-D.
I am eating more and feeling lazy again, I did make myself go to the movies using public transport, (car died) and saw the new Ghostbusters, it was good.
I thought i was on the up and up and because I was feeling good I thought I had turned that corner, but no.
Is this my life now, and rollercoaster ride.  If it is I hope the rollercoaster stays up and leveling out heaps more than going down.
Thanks for listening.

Hi.
My best friend, the only person i have opened up to about my depression besides my husband, also triggers my maladaptive behavior. 
I been diagnosed with Emotional Depravation schema. This means i feel very insecure in relationships. I developed a bond with a playgroup friend and we became close. 
Because this friend and i were close i opened up to her and she helped support me over the last 3 years. But because we were close i got very hurt when she spent time with other friends or was wasn't available to catch up. 
So many times I've thought i have to remove myself from her or I'm not going to move forward. But i don't think i can. She is aware of these issues. My therapist hasn't suggested removing myself. 
Any thoughts or experiences to help me decide what to do?

Hello, 
I am new to the forum. I decided to get in touch with people that are experiencing similar struggles....
I have been having depression for long time - on and off. Recently my depression went worse due to significant changes in my life, like career change and decision to go back to University. It has taken one semester, to loose all my stress coping mechanisms and loose control of life. About 3 months ago i went back on AD and more recent i started to see the therapist for mindfulness lessons. I was trying to have talk therapy but with my levels of a stress, my psychiatrist recommended to self-soothing technics first. I was very difficult for me to talk about the past and trigger anxiety attacks - to the stage of vomiting after sessions. 
At the moment, I am facing a challenge of finding a job in a new career - which is a public health. I am also going to volunteer for a cancer support organisation. Step by step I am following the little goals i have set up. I know it is not impossible, but the fear and self-doubts are stronger than me. 
I am really scared.. 3 months agoI could smile, I exercised every day and i was loving it. Then one night, when my second semester started, and the pressure increased, I got an anxiety attack - and turned my life upside down. I can not cope since then, medication not seems to help, and every day seems like a battle, with my own thoughts and fears.
I am really tired and out of the ideas what to do next... I know it all takes time - i Just wanted to share it with you here xxx

Thanks for reading,,I'm not quite sure where to start or what to write. I don't know much recently, how I'm feeling , what I want, the only thing I think I know, is that I just want to go some place on my own. But I don't know what id do when I get there though. I have no interest in people I avoid them, I don't like meeting new people I don't know why I just instantly don't like them, takes time for me to like them, my husband says I'm stuck up, maybe he's right, although I'm very shy and awkward with people i don't know well, maybe this just comes across the wrong way. Ive recently just had this uneasy feeling, i know i don't feel happy,, but i don't know what is wrong with me, I feel down, but I don't know why,  I have to put on a face to people so I dont seem like a total bitch. I just feel like I have no time for peoples dramas I just don't care about much anymore. I don't think Ive cried so much before, I cant seem to control it, I feel bad for my husband I know he's trying with me but I just don't feel anything at the moment. I know I'm disappointing him, Im scared he will have enough of my moodiness and disinterest and give up on me. I feel like a burden. I think to myself just snap out of it and stop been a miserable bitch but its so hard. I think I need to talk to someone, but I don't know who, id be too embarrassed going to a doctor or anyone, I don't want to take happy pills, I want to figure out how to make this right I just don't know how. Im not sure why I'm writing this, maybe just getting it out there will relieve some of this feeling.

I have a no reason to feel so low, on the surface a great husband, a great job a great place to live but I feel so blah with life. Its so boring, working such long hours from 7am to 5 or 6 at night, no real break then on weekends doing noting because I can't be bothered or were trying to save money so feel guilty for spending anything. 
I just want to sleep all the time, I don't want to go out anywhere but when I force myself its not too bad, as long as a few drinks are consumed. I just want to lie in bed all day and sleep. Sleep, I can't get enough, I sleep 8 hours a night and wake up exhausted. Plus Ive put on a lot of weight which just makes me feel like a failure. I know I need to 'snap out of it' and just exercise and grow up and eat better but I have no motivation. I have no motivation to get what I want. Im so tired of always trying and getting nowhere, work is full on then saving money, not going on holidays because we're saving Im over it. 
I should be at work but said I'd be late, I can't face it I feel anxious going in. I like my job I just feel that what if Im not smart enough for it. I study and work full time and get motivated for like a week then just fall back into my un-motivated blah state. 
From the outside what have I got to be sad about, am i just a spoilt child who is sad because I don't have what I want or my savings account isn't big enough, or not skinny enough. I don't know I just want to go back to bed and cry and sleep and its not fair on my husband to feel like this. I am on medication for slight anxiety but lately these feelings of blah and boredom with life have been larger and its harder to just get on with it.

I have from a early age though I'm not quite "" normal "" :)
im not making light of it , I just think it helps me deal with it.
 I find myself having months of endless energy and zest for life & then I hit this moment we're for a few 2/3 months I feel , deflated, anxious, annoyed, happy , crying on my own
I try to get over it by drinking and socialising , and when I was younger it definitely got "" me through"".Iam now feeling the low as I never have before and I decide to join this community and seek some ideas and thoughts.
I find my behaviour in reflection , can be terrible with drinking, I don't feel like going into that ,but I am sure you all get the picture.I work for  organisation who seems to want to help and do the right thing , but I am still afraid of the stigma of seeing one of their health care practitioners, loss of job , competitiveness for promotion Etc.
 I am great at my job when I'm ""away"" but now with  recent promotion ,I am desk bound I feel so heavy and sick and weighed down .
its makes me feel thirsty and bloated and I feel like crying all the time , I know my mother suffered very badly with depression , so I guess I am unsure if it's connected.
 im always the funny guy at work , the fit one, the guys you can count on for a laugh , so I guess doing / writing this has taken some doing 😔
Ppl when I am on top , I'm out of this world , I have a great energy and I want to be in everything and doing everything, but when this ,Black Dog comes around , I'm a shell of myself, a recluse , a drinker , unable to enjoy my love of movies and music , and ppl
i sleep around , become just another person , who I actually really dislike ,and I guess the Hardest thing is I go to work and but on a show  the "" I'm always great show ""
I hope this makes sense to someone , because it does to me , and I'm 38 now and I want to get it under control ! 
Lamy thoughts of general feedback would be appreciated :)

This is all quite overwhelming, and I'm not even sure where to start... 

I'm constantly meditating, listening to guided talks,reading positive gratitude filled quotes and exercising however I continue to feel completely useless, unloved, not important. I feel like an absolute alien.

I've moved interstate in the last 12 months and am living with my partner of 2 years and I constantly have this waive of crushing feelings come over me, I'm just not good enough. I observe every action of my partner, the way he doesn't kiss me or touch me, or call me or tell me that I'm beautiful or that he loves him... And it eats me, it consumes me, I constantly feel like I'm not important, I'm a horrible person for wanting affection, intimacy and love. I constantly feel like I'm just not good enough. 

And then I come home to spend time with family and again I feel like I don't belong here. I feel like I don't do enough for them, I have nothing in common with my family anymore, I don't fit in here and I try to make an effort. But I feel dismissed.

I don't even know where or how to start to work through this..

I'm feeling scared. I've noticed how depression has wiped out so much of my self confidence. I've been a bit tired the last couple of days and am worrying about whether another bout of depression will start again soon... I've just come out of six months or so of a difficult low period. I'm about to fly overseas in less than three weeks - for student exchange through my university - and I'm so fearful about whether this is the right decision or not. I've been approved to go for a year. It feels so difficult to leave everything that is familiar - home, house-mate's cat, car, uni, work and the few friends that I have in my city. And everyone I talk to is so excited for me, its hard to air my worry and fear. I have lived overseas before and travelled a lot, but I lack so much confidence in myself these days and feel so much less strong. I think going is worth the risk, well I hope so... but how can I trust that I'll cope? 
How do you get your confidence back when you've finally accepted that you have life-long mental illness?

Hi
For a majority of my life I have felt so isolated and hard to reach out to express how I actually feel. I have thought about seeing a GP which I did a few years back. 
Now the feeling is back and feels like its smacked me in the face 10 times over. I want to go back to a GP but having to go back over everything hurts more inside & somehow I talk myself out of it.
I have very little if any self confidence. Growing up I was never given encouragement & receiving any encouragement as an adult is hard to accept and not sure how to take it let alone respond to it. Feeling like this has made me so strong to the point I hate it at the same time. I have no family support. I only have a brother but he lives a few hours away and he suffers the same as I do. My relationship with my parents is toxic.Terrible childhood (no violence as such) more emotional abuse. I cant keep friends because they cant understand, yet at the same time I cant explain it to a point anyone cant understand. I can no longer trust anyone nor do I want to get close to anyone in the fear of being hurt or I hurt them from having so many emotions. 
I get to a point I apologise to everyone every morning that I wake up as I feel I have let them down by just waking up. I have wondered if I would ever be missed. I promise you I have never tried to end my life in anyway & I don't intend to. Its just that I feel like a burden to everyone. 
The isolation feeling gets me so emotional and I feel so low. I need to learn a new way to open up. I need sleep & my diet is poor yet I run my own business. I burn myself out every few months and just feel like I'm in a dark hole. 
I need to learn new ways to reach out without the fear of being judged or feel embarrassed. Without breaking down would be great too. I'm so confused inside I need a way to get it all out. Its so lonely. I wake up alone, I work alone, I go to bed at night alone. my fear is that I too will one day die alone & no one would know. 
 
Thank you for listening.

I recently had a bad slip into depression as things started pilling up on me. and for the first time in a long time I reached out to someone I've known for awhile in a moment of desperation needing support. 
This person then turned to me and said with a bewildered look 'wow you really don't suit asking for help"" I knew what they meant even if it was poorly worded but I started thinking! 
Did my unwillingness to accept other peoples help and do everything on my own isolate me further from people in a negative way or am I over thinking and has this ever happened to anyone else?

Hi Folks,
This past year or so I feel like I have been struggling.
When I say struggling what I mean is that I often feel like I have no energy or drive.  By the time the weekend comes I don't want to see anyone or do anything and would rather have quiet time. I find being around people draining and in my job of 7 years, I'm in a senior role and manage about 25 people so when I get home from work I want to do nothing.  If I end up  having a busy weekend I feel like I need to balance out the rest of the week to catch up and the next weekend do nothing. I don't like the thought of a night out during the week because then it feels like theres no downtime before the next day. 
When it comes to work I wake up and dread the thought of it and count down till 5:30 to get out of there. I've been getting the early rain because I want to get a seat but that means i'm at work at 7:20am.  Lately about 3-4 people have asked if I am ok because they had noticed I seemed different. I hadn't really noticed until they said something. i do feel lately thought when people ask how I am I dont have anything positive to say - I just feel like saying Im ""ok""
More lately I find I cant be bothered cooking because I dont have the energy but that often means the wrong food choices too. I used to love cooking but its just too much hassle now. I've always struggled with weight, its never stable and I feel exhausted from 2 years of being healthy and now the weight is coming back. Physically I feel about 20 years older than I am which cant be great.  
I avoid social situations unless I am really familiar with the person/s. But to the point where recently I bailed on going to a friends birthday because I didnt know anyone. Years ago i would have gone and enjoyed meeting people but now Id rather not. I am positive I have a form of social anxiety too.  I believe I am a probably very much on the introverted end.
Just dont know what to do - sick of feeling blah about everything, and want to enjoy life a bit more.

As I lie here in my bed after another sleepless night playing stupid games on my I pad, tomorrow it will not come to bed with me😢 That is an easy problem to solve, but getting up and facing the world is another, I think I may be a functioning depressed person I work full time and hold down a stressful job, I get up and go everyday, I talk and laugh with my work mates inside I am dying more every day. I have let my children destroy me financially and mentally and do not know to stop it. i am 62 and live alone which I do not mind,but I feel so hopeless pathetic and useless, thank you for reading x

Hi my name's Pete,
I work as a seasonal adventure guide. My job lets me see the world and meet the amazing people that make it spin. It requires me to be outgoing, friendly, switched on and most importantly of all, happy! let me explain to you my situation.
I've suffered from depression and anxiety for about 3 years now, it's been like roller coaster. One week I think I'm good, then the next I'm not. my way of dealing with it has been either to to block my negative thoughts out by taking my mind off of them (gym, hiking, general adventures), to move to the next place and job or, the worst of the options, resort to drugs and alcohol. These ways of dealing with my condition worked only temporarily and my depression and anxieties have since spiraled out of control and mutated into some kind of snarling beast. 
I have made the decision to take a full season off from work and return home to my parents place in Adelaide so I can face these problems head on instead of running away from them or ignoring them. It was not an easy decision to make as I have not lived at home or in Australia in 6 years, I had the opportunity to work as a guide in the tropics and continue my lifestyle. As much as I have been dreading settling back into 'normal life', I feel as if it was the right decision. No matter how good your current situation is, how happy people must think you are because of it; if you are depressed and anxious all the time, life just plain sucks. All you end up doing is perpetuating the cycle until it forms a life of its own, which is what ive done. I cannot believe i let it get so bad before I threw the towel in, it just goes to show how stubborn i am.
 Anyway, Since moving home a few weeks ago, I have thrown myself into the healthy lifestyle I had promised myself. I am at the gym everyday, eating and sleeping well, reading a lot, haven't had a drink in a month, am meditating everyday and am about to see a therapist starting this week. I was feeling GREAT until the weekend came along. It felt like all of my hard work just came unraveled so easily, I woke up feeling utterly depressed and hopeless.. How can I go from feeling so strong to so weak in 2 days? How can i remain hopeful when I relapse so easily? When will I ever start to feel good again? I know i have the strength to pick the pieces up and start again but not the motivation. I have been so emotionally beaten up over the years I just dont know how Im going to get up and keep going.. I feel exhausted

Gods, I wonder sometimes what I did in this life or a past one, to earn my lot in life currently. 
I'm 24, diagnosed with major depression, anxiety, and chronic fatigue syndrome. I'm 20+ kg heavier than my 'usual' weight. I'm utterly broke and unable to work but knocked back by Centrelink. I could go on.
It seems that every time I feel as if I've hit rock bottom, the ground collapses under me and I fall further. 
My partner used to be the kind of person who would hold me and fit all my pieces back together. Now I feel like he's standing there gaping at the volume of pieces shattering from me, struggling to cope himself with my issues.
How long before I truly hit rock bottom and start ascending again? What must I endure before I'm permitted to recover my life?
I don't recognise myself in the mirror. I don't feel like myself at all. I feel as if I'm watching myself in an out-of-body experience, I'm struggling that much to comprehend that this is actually my life. That this is all just a long and very bad dream I must surely waken from soon. 
All energy and passion for life is drained from me. Anything I've ever wanted or enjoyed doing continues to slip through my fingers.
I'm an utter mess, and I don't know what to do anymore.

Hi Everyone,
I have found lately that the things that always made me feel good, no longer make me feel good anymore.
I have been single for years now and I am finding not having someone to talk to or hang out with is making me feel, depressed, lonely, and worthless.
I am finding that I don't have any friends I can hang out with these days, as I have made a huge lifestyle change. Which makes me feel like I am lonely. This then brings me right down and I start thinking stupid thoughts in my head.
Personally I don't know how much I can take of feeling like this. I really wish I had a support of friends I could hang with on a regular basis, that understood my feeling.

Hi,
I have been struggling on and off with anxiety and depression for the last ten years, but recently (the last month or so) I've been experiencing disassociation more strongly than in the past.
 I feel as though I can't focus on what's going on around me and quite often catch myself staring into space crying and not knowing why.
I've also been feeling more and more unimportant and ghost like. It happens a lot that I'll start talking about something and will get cut off, or talked across. My boyfriend does it all the time, but so do people at work too. It makes me feel like what I have to and what I do doesn't matter. It makes me feel like I don't matter. I think my boyfriend is distancing himself from me too. He doesn't really talk to me anymore. He spend hours of the day playing computer games and hardly saying 2 words to me.
I'm not too sure how to make myself feel better or how to get my boyfriend interested in me, rather than a computer.
Please any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.

I am scared. I think I'm bi-polar. I've seen a psychologist for a few years now but honestly when I do see her I describe what I'm feeling at the time and I suffer anxiety and severe depression. But researching has me thinking I have bi-polar. My husband is a police officer and I feel like he doesn't get it. He deals with mental illness daily. I don't have anyone to talk to. How do you know if you are bipolar when it's a mixed bag of depression/anxiety?

Currently in week 5 after having a relapse of severe major depression/anxiety. On new medication and it has seemed to have taken the edge off a bit and am getting councelling. Basically living like a hermit and every time I try to get my life on track things go sour and the depression/anxiety amplify. My family don't understand what I'm going through and generally think I just don't want to work because over the years I can't keep a job and leave not long after starting it but the truth is my depression and anxiety gets so heavy that I fimd it hard to function. I deserately want to have a job and earn money to support myself and have a better quality of life. I just feel like I'm stuck in a loop. 
 
Ahhhh letting that out helped somewhat. 
I joined this forum to have some sort of a release by writing.

Hi All
Just need to get this out of my head.  I recently had my best friend end our friendship of many years.  I was beside myself for the last 5 days but now I just feel nothing about anything.  To the point where I feel I need to try anything to feel a feeling besides this nothing.  I know that I was very upset but now I just feel like a robot doing what needs to be done.  I could care less if it gets done or not.   Has anyone else experience this nothing feeling?  What did you do?

I suffer from depression.  I don't hate myself.  I dont hate my life. I have a supportive husband and i have friends.
I am doing therapy.  I'm on medication. I'm trying to keep 'doing' things like seeing friends. I've reached out to one closer friend for support.
Still I'm consumed with depression. I feel empty and lonely.
I'm not close with family as that is where my depression stems from in the first place.
Today was a day i could take a break from fighting it. Not have to put on the fake smile and pretend.  Not have to get out of bed. But my husband accepted a last minute play date. I couldn't put on the brave face so i left the house while he had company.
Tomorrow i will have to be strong again to get the kids to school and go to work.  I'm mentally and physically exhausted. 
How do people keep finding the strength to push forward will little sign of improvement?

I havent actively sought help until lately because i couldn't see a way of getting through this night mare alone anymore. I think the fact that i have just come out of a controlling 8yr long relationship hasnt helped the situation nor coming into a new relationship that is heading toward turmoil. My partner to suffers from anxiety and iv been trying so hard to help him i feel iv left my only problems in the back ground. He pushes me away but i keep being they're for him and i have no body to support me i can't keep going like this iv had enough my life seems to have no purpose hope or meaning feeling lost

Haven't been on here for a long time. currently trialing my sixth different antidepressant. Everything I have tried either has nasty side effects,  doesn't help or both. I feel sick all the time and am becoming increasingly withdrawn and disinterested.  I want to disappear so I don't have to do anything or see anyone. I am not suicidal and I am not a danger to myself or anyone else but I have had enough of everything.

Hello, I hope below makes sense as I've got persistent headaches and fuzzy thoughts.
How do I make friends as a lonely stay at home mum, and fill in the days for at least 6 months?
Background: 3 days before Christmas last year I was made redundant but this was a blessing as the workplace was toxic, and my son was unhappy in fulltime care. He's happy now and does parttime kinder, but only has his kinder friends for company as street kids are quite old.
My lovely husband works on the other side of Melbourne CBD so leaves quite early and gets home late, and he's desperate to help me.
My aging parents are on the other side of the city, my siblings interstate, and my extendeds are estranged.
I'm damn lucky to be a wife and mother, but I feel only like a housekeeper. All I do now is clean and sometimes cook. Now that my son can get his own breakfast I've been staying in bed longer and longer. I've tried to socialise with the other kinder parents but it's like I'm wearing an 'I'm weird' shirt because they are quick to keep walking past after a hurried greeting. There are 2 who give me a bit more time, but they are a bit wary of me too. Sports clubs largely don't suit my availability and the Council's help is a joke.

I find Melbourne cold, rushed, unfriendly, clogged, and huge. Recently I hoped to move to Darwin to be with my sister and her kids and in a warmer, more colourful, less rushed environment where my son can grow up with his family, commute is less, and there's a younger base and network. She had similar issues to me and has been happy there for 5 years after trying a few places with her husband. My husband has managed anxiety and loves Melbourne so I can't just tell him to move for my own wellbeing because he said he will crash. He won't even try a few months elsewhere which I think is unfair, but then, why should he since I'm the problem.
I'm socially trapped and I can't wait 6 months until my son starts school. I'm scared my depression is doing big damage to my family. Mental health services just prescribed ADs, the counsellor is another few weeks wait, and outreach program is God knows when.

Since there is no hope of moving to a happier place with a fresh start like Darwin, I'm sure I need to just find social weekday things to do that compliment the kinder schedule. 

Sorry to clog up a forum with this but I hoped to just put my thoughts into logical order and I needed someone to talk to.

Today I posted a few times; the last time I wrote some really interesting stuff about power and control. As my day has progressed, I've had increasing low feelings and a heavy chest.
I figure power is an item of contention, especially with re to my ex who I wrote about. This is difficult...I'm trying to ride it out, these feelings are known to me oh so well. It's now moving into my shoulders and up into my throat. I feel depressed, but my body says anxiety. Tears are building; trying to see the screen. Waiting for words to come...I just want someone to hold me and tell me it's going to be alright. (many tears)
I miss physical touch.
I feel raw...exposed...vulnerable
I ventured out of my protective bubble and am paying the price. I talked with him...setting myself up. His false charm got me again. Why do I punish myself like that. Memories of his hugs?
Self destructive behaviour...OMG I'm so angry with myself. I hate feeling needy. He's not worth this...I deserve to feel better about myself.
Learning to protect myself...not from him...from me. My bubble is my space and who I let in or venture out to meet has to be learned. I need to be more self aware. (Taking a breath)

I'm a 19 year old male, by the way.
I had quite a few friends in high school, and one or two that I'd even call 'best' friends. We saw each other heaps and got along so well. But now we've all gone our different paths and don't see each other anymore, and so I started at a university in March with a four month pathways course. I was pessimistic going in, thinking that nobody would be interested in me or want to be my friend, but to my genuine surprise I was wrong, and within a few days I had several friends (all female, which was weird for me).
 One girl in particular I became quite close with. She was somewhat quiet and introverted like me, and we shared many of the same interests (video games, anime, etc). She lived near me so I picked her up and dropped her off from her house every day when we went to the train station to go to uni. We quickly became really good friends and saw each other pretty much every day. You have no idea how good this made me feel about myself, and it snapped me out of the depression and insecurity that I'd had for a couple of years. I finally felt like somebody (of the opposite sex) was interested in me and cared about me and was happy talking to me every day. I've never had a girlfriend so that's another reason this made me feel like my life was back on tracks.
But sadly and inevitably the four month course came to an end, and that was today. When I dropped my friend off at her house and gave one last look at her before driving away I knew I'd probably never see her again (since she has a very busy social life outside of university, and she never showed much interest in going out with me outside of school). Words can't even really describe how utterly alone I felt then (and still feel now as I write this). It may sound extreme and stupid, but seeing her and being with her and talking with her every day made me feel like I had value to someone's life and that I wasn't worthless and that my life could finally become good.
But all that's over now.
In my emotional state I wrote a message to her on Facebook telling her how much I appreciated her friendship because I thought I wouldn't make any friends, and how I'd miss her, but that was an hour ago and she hasn't replied (even though she's online and has seen my message).
I just feel... horrible. Like, I haven't felt this alone and depressed and hurt for a really long time (maybe never). All the progress of these past four months are gone... like they never even happened.

Hi,
I'm Eloise and around 3 weeks ago a personal experience affected me deeply and profoundly. At the time I was overseas on the trip of a lifetime and was in very happy spirits. My life has never been perfect and even prior to this experience I was and still am in a very unhappy marriage. Despite this my life was functional and I sought and found enjoyment in many things that I now longer do. I can't function at all. I'm drinking almost every night or taking things to numb me or take away the horrible feelings and I was never like this before and just a social drinker. I only find solace in sleep and hate having to drag myself out of bed in the morning. I'm barely eating and have lost weight but seeing this as the only positive!!!! I have 3 kids and finding it hard to find happiness or joy in anything. The kids are happy and well cared for and would have no clue that I am going through this as I put up a good happy facade. The person responsible for my sadness initially came across as a charmer and now wants nothing to do with me and won't give me any explanations or answers. I know deep in my heart this person should be written off but I don't have any closure and cannot move forward. It has been 3 weeks now and I don't feel any better and have made the decision to seek professional help/medication tomorrow as I am having awful thoughts I cannot seem to to quash. To be honest I am not sure why I'm even here as I don't believe anything can help me. I hate myself.

I have decided to write here because my life is on the verge of ruin and I have trouble talking to anyone let alone medical professionals about this sort of stuff.

I suffer from severe depression and anxiety, especially social anxiety. It takes me years to fully open up to people. Anyone new I meet can walk all over me because my anxiety stops me from being able to express myself and I just do whatever I can to keep others happy no matter the personal cost to myself.

The males on my fathers side are a long list of bipolar sufferers so I'm concerned I may be bipolar too but I'm not sure, I could have something completely different.

I have intermittent sleeping problems, sometimes I'm fine and sometimes I'll get as little as 15 - 20 hours in a week.

I have bad problems with memory. I have been known to forget how to spell my name or what my birthdate is. Sometimes I forget what I'm saying mid sentence or repeat things to people many times not knowing I have already told them. I forget to tell people things even minutes after thinking to tell them. I have even had times I have been driving and forgotten where I am and where I'm going for several minutes.

I suffer from cognitive problems where it's like my brain doesn't work anymore. Its severity varies from day to day. Some days I'm at 100% and I'm like a computer, I am smart enough to have done university level maths in high school and came top of the school for the school certificate (which was a while ago as I'm now 29), and then there are days I take 10 minutes to calculate simple things like, for example, 128 + 37 and i'll still get the wrong answer.

The anxiety, memory and cognitive problems have stopped me from holding any job in the last 8 years for more than 6 months which has ruined my employability in the eyes of employers and can no longer find employment.

I get audible hallucinations. Sometimes not for months, sometimes every day, usually when I'm zoned out and not concentrating on anything. They used to be of an aggressive guy and a placid girl saying they were going to get me. That was years ago. These days I either get babies crying and screaming or I get a massively crowded room with hundreds of people talking to each other.

I reached my character limit and will post the rest below as a reply.

I'm 35 off meds but they messed with my head too much and don't solve the issues of the character flaws I must have, I have always had. Better people have it much worse , i know, i know, but i'm really getting tired of it all. It's like anything to help is just like putting the braindead on life support. I've no hope and no forthcoming solution but dont fret, I'm too weak for suicide.

Let me start by saying I have never posted here before and honestly I don't know what I am trying to achieve. I guess I'm just looking for someone, anyone, who understands this misery. I am a 25 year old woman and by all appearances I have a great life. I have a good job that I love, and amazing supportive partner and family, and fantastic friends. And yet I have never felt more alone.I have struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. However in the last couple of months I have reached levels of misery, loneliness and emptiness that I never thought were possible. I am so tired. I am so tired, and yet no amount of sleep makes the fatigue dissipate. I have reached breaking point. I have no desire to harm myself, but I don't know how much longer I can endure this hopelessness.Both my parents have their own struggles with mental health and addiction, so I feel as though I can't talk to them because I don't want to add more stress to their already difficult lives. My partner loves me and wants me to be healthy but he doesn't know what to do. He doesn't understand why I can't just 'be happy'. I know they are just trying to help, but I am SO sick of the people in my life telling me to just 'go sit in the sunshine' or 'get out of the house' as if that is going to be some saving grace that I haven't thought of before. Don't people know how badly I want to have the energy to get myself ready and go out into the world?On my days off, I spend my time at home staring into nothingness or sleeping. I barely have the energy to shower or feed myself. I guess I'm wondering if anyone else is feeling this way and if so what do they do to help themselves on days where the emptiness feels like it is consuming you? It took me a long time to realise that this is an illness. I am seeing a psychologist and taking medication. I am doing all the right things, so why doesn't it feel like I am ever going to get better?

Hello everyone,
My name is melissa and i am 25 years old. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression about three years ago. This past year has been the most darkest of my life. My issues have now lead me feeling completely hopeless, worthless and honestly not wanting to wake up in the morning anymore.
 I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for 5 months that destroyed my self esteem, I endured months of bullying from my boss and I was too scared to stick up for myself, so I just quit after working at that place for 7 years. No good bye party, no we'll miss you, nothing. I attempted to try and study so I could get a better job but my depression mentally broke me just a few months in. Because all that i had to move back in with my parents, I failed at everything and now im just stuck with very large bills I have no idea how to pay for. I'm scared every day because I wonder what could happen to make my life harder and more stressful then it already is. I feel as though I am a burden to everyone around me now. My anxiety has gotten so bad I cant go shopping anymore, I cant go out to lunches or dinners anymore, I have anxiety attacks so bad I get physically ill, and thats just doing any task that requires me leaving my room. My family and friends believe I'm just being a b*** and that I don't want to spend time with them. I've explained to them that I have a mental illness, they don't care. My friends just stopped inviting me places, I have tried to get in contact and reach out to them but I have never gotten a reply, but I see them constantly spending time with each other. The same goes with my family, its like a punch im the stomach when they make plans with each other and not invite me. 
I do see my gp monthly and in the middle of switching to a new medication, my third one, but I don't see a point anymore. Its gotten to a point that I honestly believe that no one would even realize I was gone if I were to succumb to the mental illness. I honestly dont believe anyone would care. I'm fighting tooth and nail every day to keep going. I'm honestly sorry if I have bothered anyone by writing this, honestly I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm lying here in my bed at 2am, with tears pouring out my eyes, just begging for the voices to stop. To just leave me alone. I'm just so, so scared..

Hi, 
 
I'm new to this and not really sure how to go about it all. So I guess I just start with how I feel. Everyday is like a constant battle with myself. I notice myself pushing people away but I can't stop myself from doing it. I can't stop myself from crying all the time or excluding myself from fun because i feel like I don't deserve to smile, i'm on medication and have been for a while though it's not changing how I feel about myself. I also get so tired of trying to explain why I am or why i'm this way. I'm at the point where I no longer have any friends and my family are just about to give up on me too. I feel so alone in a world full of people and I would just give anything to feel ""normal"" again. I hate that I frustate everybody around me and it feels like i'm a burden on people, I know that noone likes anybody who's constantly sad, I want to be happy but how do i start? I'm thinking about getting myself admitted in to a mental hospital because I just can't keep fighting myself everyday. It breaks my heart when the people I love tell me to just get over it and stop with the poor bugger me. I just feel as though I bring no joy to anybody and they just expect the worst from me or just sit back an wait for me too fall. I even feel silly trying to explain myself to strangers. 
 
Sorry and thank you for taking the time to read.

This is my first post to BB but I am at the end of my 'strength'. Over the past 18 months my life has come crashing down around me and I can't find a way out of this hell. 15 months ago my business of nearly 10 years closed due to my ill health (I was diagnosed with MS in 2008) 2 weeks before the closure of my dream my husband of nearly 15 years told me he didn't love me anymore. I had no idea he felt that way. The previous year I had 5 people around me pass away one from complications from MS on from suicide. My husband said he couldn't tell me at that point as he was worried what I would do.
So I am alone, no job, few friends with a disease that renders me useless. I have heard the 'everything happens for a reason' and 'you will learn about yourself' too many times. I am on AD's and under mental health plan, but I just don't know what to do-where to go or who I am. 
I am a nice person. I am a good person. I don't need to learn anymore!!!!

I thought I'd share some feelings sorrounding some of my experience.  For a long time these experiences have been hidden, in shame because in my experience that's what this illness makes a person feel whether it's wanted or not.  I've tried hard to lift those unwanted secondary feelings to the actual illness over a period of 10 years because I feel my illness has served enough.  Unfortunately I'm still not there, the process of lifting those feelings which are nothing but destroying, they don't change a thing, the illness is in varying forms a part of who I am today and have been all along.  So I have learned to try and fiercely rid myself of any extra burdens along my journey, I'm a work in progress.  Full acceptance of having manic depression has not knocked on my door yet, I'll get there.
At my worst, the depressive side enveloped me so bad that I struggled to 'feel', everything beautiful around me seemed like a chore in attaining, I asked the question why can't I get some nourishment? Well depression at its worst (in my own experience) felt like that, a never ending struggle to get filled up. Admittedly I faked some smiles just so I didnt have to have others in my life ask what is wrong.  Depression keeps a person under, it can destroy and suppress that you search so hard for enjoyment.  It is a cruel illness. 
In short, when i experienced my worst I thought no one would ever understand, I mean I would struggle to get through the day, wishing it would be over, the dread so extreme.  It was not something I could share, so the illness gripped me until it subsided.  
We are deserving of peace, we are people like any other with illness.

Hi all,
My name is Lauren- 24years age and I have been coping with anxiety/major depression for 8 years and recently been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I'm tired and confused often and my mind has become less-resiliant. Connecting to thought/feelings/body is something I keep trying to do because I'm starting to attack others psychically for energy. It has been a big year already (doctors,psychiatrists,case workers). I don't want to harm others (psychic attacking). I would like to be in control of my life/ body/ thoughts/ energy. Right now I'm struggling on a daily basis. Feels pointless. It's shameful for me to be out in public (even though no-one would notice) I come across with a very soft demeanour. My heads just above water. I need help.

I don't know what is wrong with me.
I have an intense self hatred and at times it spills over into hating everything around me including people at times.
I have begun avoiding meeting new people or going to events with people I barely know through the live music scene as I think I am not worthy of people's time and love. I have given up on trying to find a girlfriend, I don't find myself appealing and think I am not good looking. I have stopped performing my music at open mic as I feel like I am making a fool of myself. I have stopped looking for a job. I have lost all self belief.

And the mental abuse by my mum has ramped up lately.
She keeps telling me I bring her and my dad shame and have been bringing them down due to being unemployed and wants me to keep it secret from their friends and relatives.
She noticed grey strands coming out of my hair and told me no girl will ever want me.
Add to that the bad bullying at my most recent job this year.
It just reinforces what I think about myself.
I feel like I am becoming bitter, hateful and twisted lately.

HI Guys, 
I'm feeling pretty flat and would love to hear some advice on how to best cope with this situation. To give you a little context I'm a 27 year old male, I work full time, go to the gym regularly have an 'ok' social circle and have battled with depression the last 2 years or so. 
I'm with a girl - I love her we started seeing each other December last year everything was so great we became best friends she made me so happy and wanted to be a better person. I did a lot for her, helped her financially assisted her when she had an accident tried to be the best BF I could possibly be. She's from England and was on a working visa which had expired, we talked about things and after a lot of discussion we were pretty adamant to be together and she decided to come back on a student visa.  I gave her a lot of chances to end things and not continue the relationship but we were mutual and she wanted to come back to oz. I was really cautious (I've been hurt before and have a lot of trouble opening up) as I knew how easily I get hurt when it comes to women and my trust so I wanted to do everything right. 
 We entered into long distance relationship it was hard, we knew it was going to be hard. We talked every night really healthily, we texted constantly we were there for each other. She was so good, gave me the support I needed showed no signs bad signs, this went on for about 10 long weeks. Until yesterday, out of the blue - it was a week out from her departure date and she tells me that she's no longer feeling the same and doesn't know if she wants to be with me or come back to oz. 
 Needless to say I was pretty distraught and in complete shock, I didn't know where any of this came from. I felt completely betrayed and so hurt how my best friend could do something like this. 
 My body just shut down, we were supposed to move in together so my whole lifes plans have shifted as well. Now I'm here finding it hard to get out of bed or be active or communicate to friends/family or even eat. After a long period of being single I opened up and became vulnerable just to get hurt. 
 I managed to put my feelings aside and tell her to take time to think about it, in the end I just want her to be happy. 
 In the meantime I left work early and called up sick. 
Im feeling anxious and sick. 
 I'm really struggling and want to get anti-depressants to help me through... it's a last resort but I just want to feel level again. 
 
Any advice would be appreciated.

2 drinks at the pub after work yesterday turned into about 10 schooners of beer, maybe more. Binge drinking has affected my life for 12 years. Lately I have a big night about once a week. It's affecting my health, I'm hiding/lying about my whereabouts to my family when I'm out, and I make silly choices that could threaten my health/safety and my relationships.
My husband works away a lot which means I live on my own mostly, and the reason why I'm able to downplay my drinking. I'm so tired of feeling lethargic and unwell as a result of my drinking. I don't want to be the person I turn into after too many drinks. I'm tired of embarrassing myself and worrying that someone I know has seen me out when I'm intoxicated: I attend regular christian meetings with people who don't go to pubs, much less drink more than a couple. I am a shy person by nature and have been encouraged by work colleagues etc to drink in the past/present as it brings out my personality and I become a party animal.
After an emotional day nursing yet another hangover, missing bible study, and putting off housework that desperately needs doing I've decided to attend my local AA meeting tomorrow night. I desperately need support in order to turn my lifestyle around. My own efforts have failed. I'll let you all know how it goes. To anyone else experiencing this battle I wish you all the best in beating it.

Hi guys,
 
so I've been diagnosed anxiety disorder, and I find myself my entire life becoming so overwhelmed at anything, whether it be from stress, from not getting things  done on time and even excitement.
 
can someone tell me the feeling of hypomania? 
Because my anxiety disorder gives me false beliefs that I may be Bi Polar even though my clinical osycologist saids I'm not.. 
 
Whenever i get tensed, stressed or evenly overly excited or overwhelmed I get panicky, my heart races and my fight or flight physical symptoms become present. And with this feeling, sometimes I'm feeling I am going through mania??? But I can calm myself down and I'll be ok again. It's like all my life I've always rushed to get things done and if they're not done I'm constantly going over in my head that I have to get it done to be satisfied. It's like maladaptive perfectionism. 
 
Can someone explain that hypomania and mania is the symptoms above? My husband rushes with everything so it's possible I've learnt his traits. Please let me know what your experiences are....

Hi all,
Feeling very overwhelmed by life at the moment, and just needing to reach out for some support.
To give you some background im a 38 year old male and have struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my life.
At the moment feeling particularly sad, stressed and anxious. I have a wife and two young children and facing a lot of challenges. My job is very stressful and the expectations are insurmountable. We are facing financial pressure, and managing the home finances are my responsibility, and finding it very difficult to make ends meet. Also struggling with my relationship with my wife. I feel quite disrespected and not supported much. My wife believes that depression is always solved through medication and says she has no sympathy because im not doing anything to help myself. Unfortunately ive been down the road of antidepressant medication in the past and with absolutely no effect. To seek professional help is financialy out of reach at the moment, hence why im here :-).
Needing to make lots of decisions at the moment, trying to look for a new job, considering what to do about my relationship, trying to reduce my stress levels etc. Not a good time to do it when im teary, sad and the pressure makes my chest hurt.
I just need some understanding and someone to work with me through the issues, rather than feeling alone in the struggle.
I'm not feeling hopeful at the moment, i haven't had plan work out in a very long time.
Oh well, must stay strong and keep trying. For my sake and that of my children, i need to find a happy place in life. A place where i can find myself again. Re-learn to like being me. To be able to sit in a quiet room and not feel the need to have my stressful, sad thoughts drowned out by tv etc. Just feel like staying in bed all day. Hiding from life. Burying my head in the sand.
But as i said, im looking for a new job and trying my best to make changes. Lets hope a plan finally comes together.
Thank you for listening! Any helpful, supporting words would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you beyondblue for being such a wonderful organization! Keep up the awesome work.
Cheers!

Such a struggle at the moment to talk about my feelings, it's so much easier to pretend to be ok. 
I have struggled with depression/anxiety for so long now, the main reason due to not being able to have a child 
I feel so angry at myself for getting so bad, watching friendships slip away, not being closer to family and not living my life to the fullest, the last few years feel like a blur :( 
It feels at the time so much easier to avoid certain situations/people but in the long run u r left even more isolated from how u feel, this whole thing has hurt me inside and out, I just wish the old me could come back :( 
Just needed to vent and someone to listen

Finally feel well enough to share my story :) I was first diagnosed with depression 7 years ago just as my marriage ended.I had been living with a textbook case of a narcissistic husband and had been subjected to 19 years of psychological abuse.My depression rended me unable to work for over 12 months and included suicidal behaviour. During my recovery I finally realised what had been happening to me over the course of my marriage. I also came to discover that I could love another woman and now am proud to say I am a lesbian. Unfortunately my personality has made me susceptible to chosing another narcissistic person as my partner. We have been together for 6 years. I have been on regular medications for depression and at the beginning of this year I had suicidal behaviour and am lucky to say that my GP and psychologist were my saviours. As it came to light that my relationship was my trigger but at that point I was so defensive of my partner, I was displaying typical narcissistic victim behaviours. My depression resurfaced with a vengeance, I had the means and I had a plan to end my life. But I turned to the people that had helped me the most,first my psychologist, and inturn my GP that got me help.It required a 2 week stay in a mental health unit at a hospital.I am no stranger to hospitals as I work in one as I am a Nurse Manager. So I had to overcome the embarrassing feelings, self blame and guilt.The only way to do this was let people in to help, being honest and share what I was thinking.I have since continued with regular psychology sessions and GP visits to keep me going in the right direction. 4 months later I'm strong and clear headed enough to start dealing with the issues of my partner. We are still have sessions together. For this part I remain hopeful but am ready to make the decision,that to stay well, being in the relationship with a person who has no insight into there narcissistic behaviour is not right for me.I have support if need be and I also have a safety plan! I am determined to stay strong and actual look after my self for a change. I now know that it's not me to blame.it all will work out if we keep moving forward.smileym

Hi all,
This is my first post do here goes. I broke up with my partner of 8 years 3 weeks ago. Ever since my life feels like it's falling apart. I think I've always suffered mild depression but the past couple of months and then the breakup have got me to the point that I don't even know who I am anymore. I cry all the time, I don't have family support as they hated my partner. I feel like he has left and is off travelling the country courtesy of his dad who basically bribed him out of our relationship with money and travels, while I'm left here to pick up the pieces of my life. He has disconnected his phone yet had called several times from a private number which only leaves me feeling more upset and confused. I can't eat, have no motivation to get off the couch and I'm sooooo tired from not being able to sleep. Ive just started antidepressants but they take time to work I know. I'm alone, scared and feeling so overwhelmed with how to move on. It's like I'm in a daze.

It's so hard to take the step to ask for help and sometimes it feels extremely embarrassing but I just feel very stuck and like its ground hog day again and again. I have anxiety and depression and can remember it for a young kid the anxiety. a lot of time I live alone as I have my children 12 and 14 every second week and my partner of 18 months is a corporate in Sydney 3 1/2 hrs away and we normally only get to catch up weeks ends and sometimes it can be weeks to we do. I really enjoy when the kids are with as there is a conditional love. We enjoy each others company's as much as you can with teenagers. The hardest thing is I work mostly alone with my business and also at night I make sculptures when inspired and this is my real happy place. The biggest struggle is my over active mind and the roller coaster of emotions I can go on in just one day would make others very surprised I'm sure, I have tried and worked my guts out all my life and been quite successful the last 3 yrs has been tough and I lost the lot with a invention and I took my eye of the ball with my business. No one to blame and at least I tried my guts out having a good go. Since then it's been the depression and anxiety and the stigma of been a failure and was very tough to lose everything and been a small town most knew and after 2 marriage break ups as well one of 20 yrs ( the love died ) and the second of only 2 yrs it's been tough. I've always manage to be there for everyone and been the peace maker for a dysfunctional family , as my dads a alcoholic who tried to take his live 3 yrs ago at the age of 72 and my mum still lives with the man who sexually abused me and my brother as a child which is pretty hard to cop. I have made my peace with my mum and it will never be great but I have put it behind me, it's hard with my dad as we get on great but when my phone rings after 6pm I'm always dreading what's happened again. Besides all that it doesn't play on my mind that much as I've done my share of time with the shrinks and it's help a heap. My big thing is I'm slowly isolated myself as I get so disappointed in many peolpe with there actions towards others as it's such a dog eat dog world, but then I wonder is it just me and I do think I'm maybe I'm the one who doesn't fit in, when I do go out everyone loves seeing me,I'm well respected and honest as the day is long but I feel like robin williams as they see the different person to what's on the inside, I don't know I just feel real stuck

It all started when my fiancé said, you should enter this competition!
- Tell us about yourself..
- 3 words that describe you..
- What makes you fun to be with?
- Why would we chose you, how would you make our audience keep watching and say ""wow"" and ""cool""
Safe to say, I couldn't answer any.
I can't beleive a stupid competition entry made me realize how pointless and worthless both me and my life are.
I have no purpose in life. I wake up, go to work, come home, yell at my kids, clean obsessively, then go to bed. Most days I just sit at work and stare blankly at my screen for 8hrs. As a mother, I have no idea what I'm doing. I literally ignore them because I have no idea what to do with them. My relationship is failing because I don't know what I want, I don't know who to be and I don't have any dreams or goals to contribute - in fact I don't really contribute anything in any respect.
I've found I no longer have emotions. Like say if something bad happened, I can't feel sadness or hurt. The same goes when something good happens, I can't feel joy or even smile.
We set a wedding date. I don't really care. I'll show up on the day and pick up a white dress from Kmart on my way. I don't care for hair or make up because I have no idea what I like and doubt I'll look ok anyway.
I make people in a room uncomfortable. I don't even have to say anything. If I do speak, while reasonably intelligent, I can see people trying to wish me out of the room, or wish themselves out..
I have no friends. Like none at all. Not one. I have a Facebook account with 12 people. All family. I had a friend for almost 30 years. Now I don't exist. My only friend, couldn't even call or text to let me know she and her husband had split up. I don't know how to make friends, she and I were together since before we could crawl. I can't even remember people's names let alone know how to create a lasting friendship.
I struggle with perfectionism. But nothing is ever perfect and I beat myself up about it every minute of everyday. I'm exhausted, I never have time to do anything normal. I'm always checking that everything is perfect - the couch is straight, the wine glasses are exactly the same width apart, the lines on the tablecloth match to exactly the edge of the table, I yell at my toddler when he pulls something out of the cupboard to play with..I can't leave the house anymore.
I'm really lost and I need help :(

Hi peeps,
I need advice and I don't really feel comfortable opening my soul up to my family or friends.
I'm a 26 year old year old female with a full time job, healthy/fit, financially independent and not someone you'd expect to be having a tough time. I am an upbeat, bubbly person who runs a health and wellbeing blog and loves anything creative. I dig self improvement and motivation and all that good vibe shiz. I lack confidence (but hide it well) and have struggled with anxiety (general and social) throughout my life as I am quite a perfectionist/control freak/ocd/bubbly introvert. But my world has been turned upside down lately and I'm struggling to cope.
 In 6 weeks I:
- Found out my mum has lung cancer.
- Thought she was going to die.
- Found out it was operable through surgery.
- Went to Thailand with my now ex and got a nose job (lol - this had been booked for 6 months).
- Recovered from said nose job (ups and downs due to meds etc).
- Happy about nose job but too stressed to be overly phased.
- Overall had 5 weeks annual leave.
- Went through break up with ex upon arriving home. Not too sad about it because I wasn't that into it anyway (nor was he) and more concerned about Mum.
- Moved into my own studio apartment. Very expensive process.
- Mum started chemo and she isn't coping well at all. Very stressful.
- Went back to an absolutely chaotic, horrendously managed workplace and slammed with an unmanageable workload. Every day this week has been horrible and my managers are incompetent. It's a massive, dire mess.
- Applying for jobs at my ideal employer (a uni) and getting continually rejected (3 times).
- Ex is refusing to give back bond until he gets a housemate despite him being the full bond owner (he kept my bond in his accounts)
I know my problems are first world issues and could be worse, but it doesn't change the fact I am struggling to cope with life. I have been through a lot of change and am struggling personally, professionally and financially. I feel a drastic change to the positive, motivated, happy person I was a year ago, and as a control freak/perfectionist I am finding it hard to cope with the emotional and situational chaos. Does anyone have any tips on getting out of this darkness? With work spiralling, Mum sick, my ex saying horrible things to me, my finances looking worse than they have in a long time and an all round feeling of despair, I am failing at ""staying positive"" and ""being strong"".
Thanks :) :(

Hi there. I've suffered from depression for many years now. But iv'e just gone through a major low. 3 weeks and counting. I am a worrier and have always challenged myself whether it be work, kids or home life.I went home from work early one day as i wasn't quite able to concentrate......it then spiraled down hill from there. I went to Doc straight away and said something doesn't feel right in my head? I was on medication and he decided to increase the dose. OMG! The next 2 weeks i was literally a vegetable. I couldn't talk to anyone, i couldn't go to work, (but forced myself to on a few occasions but cant remember.I couldn't function..... The worst feeling in the world!I gave the tablets 2 weeks and had to stop taking them. I'm slowly weening myself off medication all together, but i am still not functioning normally.My head is still fuzzy. Its so hard to explain.Its not thoughts its an actual feeling in my head.My frustration is i am a single Mum with 2 teenage kids who have no idea whats going on, and work full time as a Team leader, factory and production manager. I also run a digital press and over see 2 other staff! I have 2 dogs a cat and a household to run!I feel like an absolute idiot...... People are talking to me but i can't process what it's about.I'm booked in to see a Phycologist, but feel its way too late already. I'm lost and don't know what to do anymore.What do other people feel? I feel i don't have anyone to turn to for instant help.Kim

Hello everyone,
I have been working and living in Australia for more than 7 years. Recently I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Before coming to Australia, I had a great job with stable income. However, I lost that security once I reached Australia. I am working in the university as a tutor with very low income. I also have a young school kid. Being here with no relative and closed friends, we feel extremely lonely. My son's father also lost his good job and become a driver in Australia. My son was an accident and because of the accident I married his father. Our marriage doesn't go well either.  I never feel happy for the past 7 years, and I lost all my interest and motivation to work and eat. I cannot sleep at night. At the moment, my GP refers me for psychotherapy with a mental health care plan.  The symptoms of depression make me feel very scary.

Hi folks, need some support. Life is pretty good. Just got married in Feb to an awesome woman who has been my rock. Live in a nice house, have a great son and step children and step grandchildren. Work is mostly good, some issues but not massive. Been struggling a bit lately with my ADD brain a bit I guess. But I've come crashing down. It's just not logical. Since the break up of my last marriage, I haven't felt this down. It's like I've hit a wall. Not sure what to do. I'm not having ideations at all, just really struggling to focus and lift my head up.

Apparently stress is not caused by life events but is a response to how we think about those events...well thats great.  So Im distressed to the point of exploding with exquisite misery over how to provide for my two children as I have another baby due in two months.  
 So I become cynical and sarcastic, I say to myself...""Sure!  If the fridge is empty Ill lose the baby weight quickly!"", Getting the power cut off could be beneficial for the environment!"",""The ridiculous amounts of debt I got into while drinking myself into submission for four years was worth every drop!  Didn't need my gallbladder anyway!"", But it doesn't make me feel better, just makes me more bitter.
So I try to look at the now, stop focussing on the future..I am actually sitting infront of the ocean with a world class spectacular view right now.  But I'm heavily pregnant and exhausted and have been crying all morning because I feel like an incompetent failure and I hate my partner, so I could be looking at a mass grave for what its worth.  Actually the ocean kind of is a mass grave of emptiness thanks to the human races desire to poison and destroy everything beautiful about this world.
I have been sober for 7 months now, thanks to this pregnancy and I've learnt two things about myself.  1.  I suffer from depression and I was self medicating with alcohol whereas I thought I was a problem drinker and that was causing the depression. 2. I now have a lifetime of dumb things I've done while depressed and wasted to process and sort out otherwise I'm going to start drinking heavily again after the baby, which I really don't want to do.

I grew up having no friends, I was very lonely and wondered what it was like to go out and have a good time. Like others do. I come from a broken home I think my father hated having me ....I found love at 16 well ... we were both friendless with little family so we somehow ended up together for 10 years.... the relationship was extremely abusive physically and emotionally.... I was guilty of being this way to ... one-day after work I was standing at central and decided it was time I called my father which I hadn't spoke with him in ten years. After we made contact I went to see him he helped me get out of my relationship safely. When I moved states to be with my father I was only here for not even six weeks and my mother passed away.... the last time I seen her was when I was 16, we had a argument....she said she hated me, I never seen her again after that day we'll not alive anyway. Every time I think life cannot get any worse it does..... I'm 28 with no education I have a terrible job that I hate .....I get the feeling people there don't like me neither .... I ask myself how am I still here most days. I sit alone every second I never conversate with anyone sometimes I can just hear the clock ticking and I feel like I'm going to explode. My drinking is out of control I drink everyday  gee sometime twice a day a little before work then I polish myself off completely in the evening....I can't concentrate anymore sometimes when someone says something to me I can see there mouth moving but all I can hear in my head is why the hell is my life like this the end result is I never heard what the person even said. I dread weekends yet I can't wait to get away from my job neither it's complicated. I'm 28 now and lonely, I feel like I watch every second just tick by. How come I can't make friends why have I been bashed most my life from child hood throughout my whole life...I thought I needed to be alone not to be hurt but I'm starting to think it was better when I was in a abusive relationship....atleast I wasn't thinking gee am I really going to be taken by loneliness.... I'm not sure what to do, what to think and when will I just snap ..... I feel sick and scared about what else is going to happen .... I can't take no more.

I have a lot  of issues in my life that I don't have anyone to talk with them about, which is obviously making it hard to cope.

Hi All,
i am very new to this all and just thought I would ask how other people have gone about telling there partner about their depression. I believe I have had it for many years but only have started seeing a professional in the last few weeks. I did see one a couple of years ago for a short period of time and depression was mentioned then but I guess I wasn't ready to hear it. This time around it was pretty obvious to the professional straight away what I was dealing with. Anyway I've been with my partner for nearly 5 years. He has seen it all. I had felt like this before I met him too so he has been dealing with it too I guess but I have never mentioned depression. I believe he just thinks that's me and I have a choice. I don't think he will ever understand but I do no I need to try and explain and at least let him no what is happening. It has effected us a great deal. Unfortunately he is the one I take it out on and well we are now in a unhappy place because of it. I guess this is what has lead me to seriously get help this time. For the both of us but I no I need it. I can talk to him about everything else just not this. Suggestions please.....

The scenario. You, your wife and your dog have planned a round Oz driving trip. Your wife's best friend, her husband and their dog will be in their bus. You'll travel together.
Early on in the trip they forge ahead, on each leg they go out of sight and you wonder if you break down that you won't have the help you could have had if he'd kept an eye on you and kept close by.
You drive along an outback highway and it happens, engine oil seal gives way. A tow job. No phone range. Your friends don't know, they were 5 kms ahead. You hitch a lift 60kms to the last town and organise the tow truck. You wait at the van park until its fixed.
Your friends text you when they are finally in phone range about 300km away. You reply that you are OK, the car needed towing and ""this is why one should keep watch on the other party""
You also tell them to continue with their holiday but you are fuming inside.
There are many questions but these are the ones I need answering
- it it unreasonable to expect your friends to automatically realise for safety reasons to stay together?
- if you think so and they don't share that view, would that difference mean you could not ever be close mates?
- is there a bare basics level of mateship that you expect from friends.
As we are in our van waiting for our car repairs my dear wife wants me to remain friendly towards our ""friends"" which I would now find difficult. But I'll try. Well meet about 5 days from now.
Here's the thing. Had the tables been reversed when I found out my mate was stranded or even settled back at the caravan park, I would have driven back there to support them. In fact on two occasions that happened on our trip.
Is it unreasonable to base your friendship with someone upon your own values?
How can you calculate acquaintance will make a committed ""mate"" in the long term? So you can save time and not waste effort on someone that would leave you for dead on an outback highway?
Are we unfair having expectations?
Two mates head off riding their trail bikes. One gets a flat tyre. The other says ""too bad, its not my bike that has a flat tyre"" and rides off. It would be a given that they'd help each other in such circumstances.
But my sister hit the nail on the head. ""Our father always went over and beyond the call of duty and always got hurt"".
Im tired of people hurting me. It has to stop. The walls are going up!
I just have to find a way of doing that and putting on a smiling face at the same time
Tony WK

Hey all. So I'll try and summarize it all. I'm 23 year old female from the UK, I came out to Australia in Feb with the intention of doing the year as I have the working visa. 3 weeks in I fractured my collar bone but was also feeling extremely depressed/lost/struggling with lack of routine in terms of eating/excercise and so the collar bone was the perfect excuse for me to come home. Once home felt relieved, then the depressed/lost/empty feelings returned, novelty of being home wore off had zero motivation to find work, went through phases of wanting to run away, tried to move out at one point - just always trying to run away from my problems inside my head.
 I then decided to try Australia again as I still had what felt like 'unfinished business' over there, so impulsively booked my flight back and now here I am, back to that same old feeling, lost in Australia. I've wasted so much money, I feel depressed, my eating habits are all over the place. I have never been diagnosed with anything but known for a long time I've had issues I've just been too afraid to confront them. I'm a vulnerable mess over here and it's reached the point where I need help. I just want to disappear into nothing. In all honesty I should have stayed home and got the counselling I know I've needed for the past 10 years of my life. I've tried so hard to push through but all I'm doing over here is crying every night, then either not eating all day, or overeating all day in an attempt to control the pain.
 All I really want to do, is go back to England, get professional help and really finally get my life on track. I know I don't want to be here anymore but I really need help in what you think is best? I have a great support system at home, my family love and support me and my own mum is a counselor so she will understand (I hope) but it's just the shame and guilt, and wasted opportunity, and failing Australia for the second time, that is stopping me.
 I'm not ready to face family (except my parents) and friends and explain everything. I just want the comfort of my own home and professional help without having to see anyone for a while. Please someone help with what I should do? :(

when I want to frown I force myself to smile, when I want to cry I laugh. But lately its been catching up too me and its getting harder to keep it up! Feel like I'm heading for a breakdown of epic proportions! 
Maybe I just need to take a step back and catch my breath for a moment before life decides to start throwing more BS my way??

Hi all, I have only just joined beyondblue but have struggled with depression for much of my life. If you suffer depression, you will know it is not something that simply just goes away or that you can just easily switch off. As such, support from those who are going through it or have been through it is vital in my opinion.I have suffered from depression over the years and it is always hard, but there are ways to alleviate the problem. I have never been one for antidepressants and refuse to take them, but I am not knocking them either - if they help, that is what is important, at least to help lift your mood. I prefer the natural route myself, but that is just me. Not judging, it's just the way I choose to go. One thing I have found help me a lot when I feel depressed is humour. I normally have a great sense of humour, but when you feel depressed, you don't feel like laughing much! I have a great collection of comedy, which I use to lift me up and get myself to start seeing things differently. This works, but you might need to keep at it a bit and start slow.Deep breathing and a simple walk can do wonders to change your outlook. The worst part about depression is how it skews your perspectives and makes you see things negatively, and not necessarily as they really are. Its so hard to see outside the 'box' you are in when you are depressed. Even worse, others who are not going through it or have not been through it, often don't know what to say or do to make you feel better, I know. So, be your own best friend! I have found, thinking on paper helps a lot - at the very least, make a list - a long one, of things you are proud of, happy about, things that make you feel good, or confident, loved, respected, and elaborate on each one in writing. Keep it to yourself, so don't be afraid to write down anything - it's your list, no one else will see it. Just doing this, puts you in a better frame of mind.Hope these help, and lastly, please realise it is never as bad as it might seem in your own mind. There are ALWAYS answers and ALWAYS people who care and can help, if you give them a chance.Grant

Hello BB
I am a 32yo female, a qualified health professional, in a wonderful secure relationship. I live in a nice house, drive a nice car, make good money & have good relationships with family & a handful of close friends. I generally have good physical health, I really have nothing to complain about.
BUT....... That is the exact problem, despite all this I feel like a failure. I feel like I am not good enough, I feel like I'm a useless burden to everyone.
I have battled depression since I was a child, my parents first sought help for me when I was about 9 or 10, & I have seen various professionals since. It wasn't until a few years ago that I accepted depression was with me for life, & was something I would need to tackle EVERYDAY for the rest of my life. I've been medicated on & off for years, but I useto take myself off it as I knew how to do it safely, I have been pretty good for the last 2 years I stuck to my meds & had regular CBT with a psychologist who I really clicked with. I built good support networks, opened up about my depression & even weathered a few 'storms' (difficult times that could potentially unravel me). 
The issue is that the negative self talk is winning the battle at the moment, I've had a few challenges lately, but nothing severe, and nothing that should have been so unraveling to my mental health, which only adds to the feelings of failure, 'why am I so emotionally usless?' Is a question that runs around my head frequently. I started a new job & am finding it difficult, because even tho it's in the same field, it's a new skill set & I am not feeling confident at all!
My partner is overseas for work at the moment, he is a huge part of my support network & I guess I underestimated the effect his absence would have on me. I started the downward spiral about 6 weeks ago, I hit rock bottom last week, I have had to take a few weeks off work, am changing medications (having awful withdrawl at the moment) & need to find a new psychologist because the one I saw previously has stopped practicing due to her own poor health (this makes me so sad, she is young with 2 small children and a beautiful soul).
I guess I don't really need advice, I've been on the 'merry go round' for years & have started the process of getting better yet again. I am just a bit lonely & edgy at the moment, I'm alone at home & I guess I want to hear from people who understand what it's like to face the internal challenges again, & again, & again.
Thanks Leya x

Hi all
I wanted to get some feedback from some men who have experienced similar to myself and come through it.
As a 28 year old guy trying to find my way in the world I have recently been experiencing anxiety and depression and have started seeing a psychologist and taking meds.
All of my stress comes from my chosen career path as a tradesman and wanting to make a career change. Also supporting my girlfriend while she is at uni. Moving to a new city. Being away from family and friends etc
I have been super reflective the past few months and really been evaluating my life. I feel like I'm wasting my life in a career I don't have a passion for. Feeling internal pressure to support my partner and make our move to the new city work. Also not wanting to let us down.
Has anyone else gone through this sort of thing at this age?

I am not up for spending hundreds to thousands of dollars on psychiatric help to tell me I'm afflicted with something that can't be fixed.
 I've researched for 20 years now and have never come across a fix or anything that works, even slightly. 
I need someone honest enough to give it to me straight: I'm depressed, and there's no fix. I have to live with this forever, don't I?

After 3 months of feeling great due to a medication change and starting uni I have gone backwards.
An incident with a girl I asked out (see my thread in relationships & family) has left me feeling down.
I thought I was over depression and anxiety for good, wouldn't have thought it would return.
I even recently met with my psychiatrist a few weeks ago for him to see how the change in medication is going and I was so happy and told him great.

Hi all. First time here so a bit nervous,  but I figure this is the first step, right?
Anyway. I'm here because I'm desperate to go back yo the way I was - happy.
I've had anxiety and depression on and off during my life (well, since my teens). About over a year ago now I was overweight. After finally having enough, I went through a big bout of determination and as of October last year, I had lost over 30kg. I was (and still am) finally a healthy weight. But since then, my eating and exercising habits have not been very good. I've somehow maintained my weight, but my eating habits are poor.
So recently, my wifes uncle just found out after having a tumour removed from behind his eye and being in remission - that the cancer has returned at the base of the brain and is inoperatable. 

This got me thinking about my own mortality and since then I have dug myself in deeper and deeper to a state of depression. Lately, all I've thought is that life is pointless. I can do and say anything, but what is the point? We all die. Nobody will remember anything I do or say. I make no difference. Everything I like doing I just think ""What's the point. It's all going to end and everything you do or have as a hobby is just a momentarily happiness that will just end.""
So as you can tell, I'm pretty deep in this. I will do anything to get out of this.
Another thing I probably should add is that lately, I've been questioning my faith. I've never been heavily into religion and have only just recently learning that perhaps there is nothing out there. No afterlife. No anything. I had always believed in ""something"" and that made me happy and hopeful, but know nothing. 

Please help! It's affecting my wife and I can't bear to do this to us.

Hi all,I've had depression and panic/anxiety for 25 years. It comes and goes in intensity but at the moment it has returned with a vengeance. I feel down, detached from reality and times, finding myself just zoning out. My old friends, palpitations and ""missed"" heart beats are also back. I take an antidepressant and have just started taking a small amount of a benzodiazepene each day. This episode seems worse than most, I can't see a recovery any time soon. I thought I'd turn to the Beyond Blue community for advice, to know that I'm not alone in this, that others feel this way. I don't really talk about it, even with my wife and friends and perhaps that's where the problem lies. I am seeing a very good therapist so I am seeking professional help. Thanks for listening.

Hi there, 
Im posting mainly to free how I feel (hopefully). And seek some advice on what I can do to help myself before it's too late. 
I have been suffering mental breakdowns especially over the last two months. I wake up and cry and dread going to work or doing anything really. I dont sleep well. I have nightmares like there is no tomorrow. I cant get my happiness and mojo back. I know there is something wrong with me, especially cause i know what it feels like to be happy and right now im completly the opposite. 
I currently work as a cop, and the job is demanding. The things I have experienced keep replaying on me and have changed me as a person. I feel like I cant help anyone, and when I do it gets thrown back in my face. i've tried to help and i get death threats towards me and my family. I hate it when people automatically assume im mean, just because im a cop. I am the most kind hearted lady anyone will meet, and always try to have a smile on my face and i believe communication is key when dealign with people not violence. people treat me differntly, im not even sure if they mean to but they do. people just assume thats what ive turned into, which i havent. I am still myself, and i do the job because its a job. and i genuenly wanted to help people. i just need a break. But if you seek help in my job, you get classified as ""unfit for duty"" so you literally have to bottle everything up. they dont care about you at all. 

Im stressing cause of money. I have to support my parents because they have no money and I dont want them to lose their home. they live 5 hours from me, and i stress each day that they will be ok. i need the job so i can give them money and pay my bills too. Ive applied for so many jobs, and i honestly think its because of my profession now no one will hire me. havent even had an interview. previous i did marketing and sales for radio, which was the best thing ever. I feel like ive made the biggest mistake joining law enforcement and its so hard to get out. I cant just quit cause i need an income,  and they make it so hard to leave. I just hate the fact that everything i used to love to do, i now dont enjoy. and i am miserable all the time, and it effects my partner and i's relationship. I know it sounds trivial and i should be more grateful to even have a job but really cant keep living on like this. I just need some help i think, but i am not sure where to start. anything would be helpful... please and thankyou.

Hi all, i feel silly even posting here but i just feel like i am not coping very well lately.
I struggle with anxiety and feel completely miserable most days, i don't like myself very much and i just assume everyone else hates me too.
I get so down that i wish i just didn't exist at all and basic things like dealing with other people causes anxiety, i feel tense, stomach is in knots etc all because i feel others are prettier, smarter, more capable than me and that eventually they will see me for the weak loser that i really am. I feel like i want to curl up in a cave and just sleep for 10 years just to get away from myself.
I don't have anyone to talk to about this stuff,  there are a few people in my world who are nice and i feel do care about me but i do not want to burden others with my problems because thats unfair on them, lately i have found myself bursting into tears over stuff and it takes me by surprise because normally i am tough and don't cry. What the heck is wrong with me !!?
How do you manage to keep afloat and not drown when you have no one to turn to ? It makes me feel so weak and silly because everyone else seems to manage ok without having anyone, why can't i ? I want to stop feeling this way and i have tried so hard to calm my anxiety and keep busy, if it wasn't for the fact that i had a child i would have just ended things by now.
Can anyone relate ?

hi, when i was in my 20s i enjoyed life. i was married at 23 wit 4 children. things tumbled when i hit 30 and no happiness in sight. my husband left me with small children and i was pregnant at same time with 5th child. i gave birth and was grieving and looking after 5 small children wasnt easy. my husband had affair with my best friend. i lost two people not one. 3 years later i met a guy who i thought was soul mate. my ex was jealous and was putting kids in middle. that person left me and 2 years later at age 35, i fell in love again. problem was he needed help with immigration to stay here. i loved him i did it. i married him and had his baby. sadly he didnt tell me he had a girlfriend back home. she would fight to keep her relationship with him. he had an affair with girl from work who told me about affair when i was pregnant to him. he used to beat me anytime i say i loved him or ask why dont he love me? i did everything for him to try and make him happy. night after night he never came home till past 11pm totally drunk. i would worry about him. he told me too he wants to commit suicide. i stayed by his side through it all. it made me so sad i cry myself to sleep every night. before i had his baby i had miscarriage and i haemorrage at home. scared confused and alone i was afraid n i called the ambulance. i was taken to hospital and was told its a miscarriage. i begged the hospital i want to stay i didnt want to go home but they said i couldnt. i went home and saw porn on my computer, a totally drunk man in bed. he never cared if i lived or died omg. well we broke up after my baby turned 1yr old and i received text message im dead from girl back home he engaged too. he lived in another house but he be asking me to come every weekend n hang n have sex which i did for 3 years later until he stopped wanting me. 
i have no relationship with my mum nor my father. my mum is racist and doesnt like the people i married. she insults me and calls me dirt and im unclean.
 
i have no friends either. they go to club and never invite me or do anything with me i feel. we only go out to eat. which i think contributes to my fatness. 
i have no stable job since i was made redundant 2 years ago. i went back to uni since redundancy just keep trying but nothing is working. when i fail a class i feel i cant do it. im dumb stupid fat and unlovable as i keep losing relationships than gaining. im not introvert and i cant get out of this rut. help me pls

Hi there
About 5 years ago I was getting treatment for depression/anxiety, and managed to get out of it.  After 5 years of being happy and motivated, I think I'm back there, but in a different way.  I know all the signs/symptoms, and have been trying to manage it myself for the past 6 months, but I need to be honest in saying I need help.  I don't think I need help with my way of thinking or behaviour, I think its more about stress this time.  I've started tearing up at little things, staying up far too late (6 hours sleep a night), and developed a strange happen of chewing the inside of my bottom lip, which I've never done before.  
To explain my stress at the moment:

I changed jobs 6 months ago to a much stricter, less fun job where I have no friends still
My mum has been going through some kind of dissasociative disorder where she thinks she's not still married to my dad (it seemed to have happen overnight), and it's been tough on everyone
I got engaged to my partner 3 months ago, and wedding planning has been intense
I'm studying online which is hopefully finishing in a months time
I rent with my older brother who drinks a lot and never helps with the housework
I have no savings for a house, but my fiancee does.  I feel extremely guilty
Girlfriend issues (sex has been reduced to once or twice a month, lack of quality time spent together).

 I think because of these factors and my struggle to deal with them, I've torn away from my friends, ​stopped exercising (I used to run alot, but now can't find any motivation to do it), and pretty much lost all motivation for life and having fun.  I talk to myself in a really condescending way, telling people and myself that my life is boring and done, meaning it is what it is and there's nothing I can do now.  I speak like I had my chance in life, and this is all I have left.  
I feel like I don't need advice or lectures, just someone to hear me pour it all out.  I'm constantly trying to fix things and make my life better, but this underlying stress seems to remain no matter what I try.  And I know what I should be doing (going to sleep on time, exercising, get more sun, etc), but I can't seem to do these things.  I tell myself that when my study ends, things will get better, but something deeper down is telling me they won't.  
Not sure what I'm asking for here, just putting it out there to the universe I guess.  Will probably have to seek professional help, I just wished I could have fixed this on my own.

Hi everyone, 
I have never posted on an online forum before, so here goes. I am 32 yo woman who has recently been diagnosed bipolar. I have had manic episodes in the past which have upturned my life. I have a psych degree but have been working in retail for the past 10 years because of consequences of mania and low motivation, as well as having to move to a small town with little opportunity due to having to care for my mum, who passed away a few years ago now. I am now studying to be an occupational therapist, but juggling work with study is really hard and on top of that I am medicated now so I get tired really easy and keep having depressed feelings and depressed days where I can hardly get the motovation to do anything. I got a not so great grade today from uni (I am studying online) and I know it sounds stupid and petty but it just felt like the last straw. I don't know how to keep going. I am just so tired. With the work and the study I have hardly any time for me. Before I started studying I was doing better but at the same time I want to do something different with my life. Going to see a psychiatrist on monday so maybe different medication might be the answer I don't know. I try to talk to my partner about it but because she is not depressed it is hard for her to understand. Just wanted to put my thoughts out there, thanks for listening.

I'm not entirely sure I really want to live a full life. I feel like I have already. I can see my entire life for what it is, what it will be and there isn't really anything worth hanging around for. I'm not suicidal per say, I fear death, suffering, failure (for the guilt trips from loved ones and possible disability) and something so final...but I don't want to be a part of my life anymore. I'd rather a clean slate. In all facets of my life I am not happy, and haven't been for quite a long time. If not all of them at once, just one or two more than others. I can see exactly how each option will work out. I am not happy at work, I struggle with relationships, I'm just lazy and don't care while caring too much. The solutions are always ""have you tried yoga?"" Seriously? Yoga? How on earth would that help?! Yeah, yeah, serotonin and movement. Of course, I am just in the ""wrong"" mindset and if I actually tried I could be happier. Sure sure. I just can't be bothered even entertaining such time wasting, it's just a pety distraction from the reality. This green smoothie and stretching sure makes me feel less like life is a waste of time! YIPPEE!
 At work everyone demands too much, or asks stupid questions. My field is purely dealing with all of the dregs and nonsense and having to answer the same questions constantly. A problem to solve puts a cloud over me that I can't lift until the issue is resolved or gone. I don't know how much longer I can deal with stupid people and their stupid demands. How much longer can I come into work and stare at a screen all day? I've tired of all of the take away. I'll have to do this for the rest of my life? Why bother? Before you say get a new job, I am a few years away from long service leave, so why cut loose now? That and everything I have experience and training in is the same. Same crud, different workplace. Nothing would change. 
I find no satisfaction in anything. I get bitter at the car that runs the red light, the subpar food I am served in a restaurant, the rude person, the rain, my washing machine, anything. I'm cynical before anything else and can't imagine constantly looking on the bright side, because when I do I am put in my place and realise I shouldn't have bothered. 
 I'm seen as wrong all of the time by my partner, because he just doesn't understand me. I can't get my points across. 
I just want to cancel my life, cut the subscription and start again as a new person with better prospects.

I am so pleased to have found a forum as tonight was one of the lowest points I have been in for over three months now. Since 15 years old I have suffered from Major Depression. I am a practicing nurse and chose this path to learn more in-depth about why my mind works how it does. I don't have a bad story, I had a beautiful upbringing in a wonderful family, with no bad turns happening throughout growing up. I did always have issues keeping friends, purely because at 15 I felt like I was too tired to bother with anybody. From then on I have been on a rollercoaster of constant emotions with nothing slowing it down. I have tried to observe for triggers, but with no avail. The most frustrating part is I had nothing to be upset about but I still feel to this day that my world crashes down around me for no reason. The current trigger is my father's health, but he is alive and for that I am so thankful - but I still feel extremely emotional. I look into the future and think about where I will be - I am engaged to an amazing boy who I couldn't complain about. But when I look into the future, I don't see one. It's like I would rather disappear and end this uphill battle because it's the same thing repeating itself month in month out. I am here because I need help. I need to know how long term sufferers are handling and coping with this everyday because this past month I have given up. My last option is to reach out because I have nobody who understands how this feels and how much I want to be better but it's not as easy as snapping out of it. So I have three questions. With severe depressive episodes - how do you cope?. With constant relapses into depressive episodes, how did you delay the relapse if it is possible? && Final question - I have refused to be put onto medications, should I take this path? I know it will help I want to know what you are taking if you could share this information with me :(
 
Thank you wonderful people and god bless

Hi there, I've had schizophrenia for about 15 years now and I've never really used a forum for it before. I'm doing ok here, I manage to plod along, 3 steps forward for each step back... but it's better than 2 and 1 right? :-)I found that music and especially writing lyrics was a turning point in my life and my ability to manage my depression and anxiety to a much higher level.I'd love to share some of that with you, as I explore the forums. I built a site today to house the songs, but it's very under developed. I need to work out how to get it built properly at some point, but if you are curious, you can ask and I'll post some.I'd love to talk to anyone about creativity and how it can help anyone. Truthfully, I started with nearly no experience 2 years ago. You know what, here's a sample of a song lyric.BLISS, LYRIC SHEET.We have only known each other for a little whileBut I already knowHow deep and sweet the beguileAnytime you smileI'm not about to say I love youWhen I want it to mean everythingNot about to sweetly lead youInto any kind of deceitThis feeling between usFeels a lot like a kissAnything less is a missThis chance to be an usIs not remise It's so much BlissCould fill the deepest abyssThis feeling between usFeels a lot like a kissThis chance to be an usIs not remise it's so much BlissBelieve in meThere's nothing up my sleeveBreathe with meAs free as the breezeBelieve in meThere's nothing up my sleeveBreathe with meBreathe with meI'm not about to say I love youIf I can't show youNot about to sweetly lead youInto any kind of deceitI'm not about to sayThat I love you...END LYRIC SHEET.A cute little poppy love song, but I do all ranges from very damaged lyrics to very hopeful ones. I think it's important to realise that we are a range of things all at once after all!Cheers for reading. I'm about to go explore some threads.Matt.P.S. I'd love to share some ACTUAL tracks with you guys and girls, but the forums wont allow me to post actual links, so hit me up and I can show you directly what I do and tell you how it's really been a massive help in every day life.

I'm 35 in October, I'm on a disability pension from the Army and a carers pension. I have depression and anxiety. 
 all I want to do is get married and have a couple kids, I just have no idea how to get a boyfriend, I just seem to hesitate because one minute I think I have a lot to offer, I'm adventurous, smart, love sports then I get negative and think I'm over weight from my meds, my finances suck and I'm currently unemployed, who the heck would want that!?!?!?

Hi, I am new to the forum and have only recently disclosed my depression to my employers, which was one of the hardest things I've had to do in my life!!.  My wife and I have started to talk to our children (15) and (9) about my illness.  It is hard for our youngest child to understand and I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions, maybe even picture books or children's books that deal with depression or dealing with the 'The Black Dog'?
Looking forward to your thoughts/recommendations.
Thanks everyone

 Hi everyone, 
3 years ago I had a bad depressive episode. I quit my job and was hospitalized. Since then I've crawled my way back out of the hole. I got another better job, joined a gym- became able to cope with life again.
Lately I've been apathetic. I've been avoiding social situations again (social phobia) and although I'm not what I call sad. I don't care about anything. Life is pointless. I really feel like I'm just waiting for my life to end. I've tried to get a hobby. Find an interest to give me some purpose in life but I don't enjoy anything and not only that I am too tired to put the effort in. 
 I'm terrified I might relapse. Should I go back to my gp?

I'm writing here for the first time, I think mainly because I need to feel like I'm somehow connected to people  who think, even remotely, like I do. 
I've suffered from depression and anxiety for a long time. I was first diagnosed last year but I can't remember a time when I didn't have this feeling of sluggishness, discomfort, and most poignantly the feeling that I am unsafe. I've lived a perfectly good life, I'm from a middle class family, I've had a good education and now I'm approaching the end of my art degree. I paint, I sing, I teach music to children, I run a choir now, I have a partner, I live a perfectly good life. I do all the things people tell me will make me happy. I cannot mention that I am unhappy anymore because it feels like a burden and a bore. There's never change, unless it's getting worse, if it gets better I'm still sad and no one seems to understand. And besides, it doesn't add up, because I live a perfectly good life.
There are trauma points in my history, but I'm starting to think I made them for myself to compensate for my internal unease. I'm filled with shame and confusion and a constant desire to be honest in a defiantly dishonest society, which is what I am trying to ease by posting some of my story here. I know nobody wants to know, because this is an anonymous forum. No one who will read this cares about who I am, or will be affected by any differences I make on the planet, presumably.
 I just don't know what to do anymore. I've taken all the steps. I've been on medication, and nothing works for me, and besides I want a long term fix, not to permanently be reliant on drugs that change my chemistry. I can't be sure if I like myself because I don't have confidence in my own opinion, and I am not sure who I am anyway. I can't identify as anything. I'm female, and I'm male. I have more than one will and voice in my head. But because I love my family and the people around me I can never reveal the extent of the collapse of information in my head. 
All I can be sure of is how I feel, because it's in the present. I feel love, I feel fear of losing that love. I am yearning for a purpose to my suffering. I need to know I am making something for this world that isn't negative, that contributes to humanity. But all I feel is loneliness. And shame. And then fear. And sometimes anger. But mostly it is just heavy, lethargic sadness. As soon as I am on my own, I am crushed. I can barely take this anymore.

I've been a depression victim for several years but the last couple of weeks have been awful since I have stopped taking my AD. I feel like I'm living the same day over and over again doing the same things at home and wasting my life away. I can't really go out by myself because of my anxiety and have to keep relying on my mum to take me places which is unfair on her. As it stands I'm so bleak and down and horrible it feels like no therapy, place, people, things or medication will ever help me, like I'm never going to get on top of this. I keep thinking about other people that are out enjoying their lives doing their own things feeling happy and I often wonder how they do it. I have been talking to my GP and Psychiatrist about it but its like they don't really understand. I have an appointment with a new Psychologist next week but I am kind of dreading it because it will just be the same stuff, I explain to them how I feel but they really don't understand. Has anyone else experienced this kind of situation?

Has anyone ever felt that they just don't fit in anywhere?
Maybe you don't fit in with their old best school buddies anymore, because they are still out there living the dream and you have settled down with a family and kids?
Maybe ​you don't fit in with the business world anymore because you're no longer part of it? Because you quit. Because of circumstances.
Maybe you don't fit in with the ​mums in your kids class at school pick up because they are stay at home mums and you can't relate to the same things?
Maybe you feel jealous at people that have the life you could have had, the ones who got the good opportunities?
Maybe you hate the so called ""mentor"" that you trusted, because they promised you an opportunity that you really wanted and they gave it to someone else. And everytime you turn up to their business it's in your face that it isn't your opportunity. And you have to live with that and pretend you don't care.
Maybe you just don't fit in anywhere at all and you wonder if things will ever change.

Hi. This is my first post, I normally call support services or seek advice from my GP but today someone thought it may benefit me to join the forums. I have suffered with depression since the start of highschool. I'm 24 now and I feel well over half of my days are a real struggle. I find it hard to get excited about anything, nothing really gives me much pleasure and sometimes when it is really bad; I feel trapped and so alone. Stress is a real trigger for me. I feel incapable most of the time to help or look after myself. I don't have many friends and I feel that I am a constant burden on my family. I haven't felt ""right"" for a long time and I struggle to eat most days. I'm not sure how detailed I should get here, I don't see much point in typing out all of my personal issues or problems just yet. I just thought I should try to make contact with people who are also struggling with day to day life and maybe for once not feel so alone. Thanks for reading.

I had a bad night last night. Usually I try to listen to music to get to sleep and let me relax. Last night I couldn't. 
All I could hear in my head was reminders and memories of times when I embarrassed myself, or when I was made fun of, when people yelled at me. How I have noone to depend on and how noone understands. I have Anxiety as well and I felt so nervous and jittery I couldn't relax. It has been getting worse for days. 
My mister is great and supports me as best he can, but he doesn't understand and constantly worries he has done something and I am draining him...
I haven't really left the house in weeks apart from food shopping. I don't have a job despite looking for one, I'm scared a lot of finding one too, and dealing with people. 
I don't like myself or where my life is at, and I feel like I am about to lose it completely. I want to see a psych but I am waiting on a call because my GP put in a plan because I am super broke right now.
I don't know what to do.

It's been a while since I wrote a post on here (hear the guilt?). Depression has set in so far for over 2 weeks. Today is one of the worse days. I have housework to do, I need to order medication, I need sleep, I need to have a shower and so on and so on. The guilt and lethargy seems to be ruling my day today. 
I know lack of sleep (caused by fibromyalgia) is playing an integral part in the depression hanging around and yet I don't like feeling like I sleep all the time. I feel more guilty when I do sleep during the day even though I know its imperative for my health.
I am struggling to do anything much at all. Even eating...again, imperative for my health.
I have these tools I usually use when I am depressed and I don't even feel like using those. My brain is saying, put off the washing up until later, its not going anywhere. No one is coming over today, you don't need to shower right now. Take the rubbish out tonight when no one is around.  Order the medication tomorrow, you have enough to last you 3 more days.
Wow, just typing this down makes me feel even more guilty  and more self critical. It makes me feel like I'm drowning and there's no steps on the side of the deep, dark pool. There's nothing under my feet to stand on. It's just dark and cold and dark and lonely and did I mention dark?
Now for the tools.....
Sitting at my desk is not going to help me to achieve what I need to do to help myself and no one else can do the things I need to. So first things first, set 1 or 2 goals for the day. My goals today are to do the washing up and to have a shower. Will I feel less depressed after doing these things? Probably not but at least there will be 2 things I've done that need doing. 
I also need to eat lunch and get something out for dinner. These are necessities to live and so do not go on my goal list.
After doing the dishes, I'm going to reward myself by watching a movie.
So on that note, I'm going to go make lunch. It's 1.10 pm here and the longer I sit and do nothing, the less likely it is that I will eat and/or achieve my goals.  
I hope you all have as best day as you can.

I'm an aspiring actor and musician. I work odd jobs to pay my way in between artistic pursuits. I like working - a lot. It gives one a feeling of belonging and accomplishment. Unfortunately, a lot of the jobs involve working in less than inspiring environments and with some vicious personalities. I'm quite a sensitive soul. I don't mind hard work, in fact I like it, as long as there are positive people around me. I don't belittle people and when someone belittles me I find that after all this time, I shouldn't have to put up with someone judging me and making me feel small. I think I have depression. Or anxiety. Or a mixture of the two. I exercise - intensely. But I'm easily tired of late, and I think it's down to the dire financial situation I'm in. To think that there's an audition round the corner which will propel me into a successful acting career seems highly unlikely. I don't want to be the result of a typical failed actor who ended up a drop out. But I'm in such a solitary position. And there's only so much rejection a person can take. Especially in a big city where money is king and without it one is a useless tramp. I don't drink alcohol anymore. I thought this may help. I don't know where to turn. I don't know if there's anywhere to turn anymore. I'm sick of being a second rate citizen.

Hi I'm Karl. I'm in my late 20s and have suffered from bouts of depression since I was 13. Just in the last few days I have decided that I need to reach out and get some support because it's terrible that I have spent nearly 20 years being sad. It's been a vicious cycle. I've lost 2 friends to cancer in the last year and a family member passed away in January. I'm having a hard time coping and I'm not looking after myself properly. 
 i am so lucky to have a girlfriend that loves and cares for me so much and she is always there for me. But I need to give her some relief and need support from others. I want to own my life. 
 If anybody from Perth knows of any support groups that may be of help I would very much appreciate it. I just want to be happy. Like we all do and deserve to be!

For a few weeks now I have been having nightmares and unpleasant dreams all through the night, usually more than 2 a night. I get to sleep at a decent hour and wake up completely drained and in a terrible mood.
A lot of them I don't remember yet they've put me in a bad mood all day. Sometimes its about people from work, if we had a fight or they said horrible things to me or about me. The dream felt so real its hard to forget the fact it was a dream. Which makes me analyse over everything they say to me and how they say it.
On top of this, my nail biting habits have gone a bit far. I have been biting the skin on my fingers to the point they bleed. Its an unconscious habit that I'm finding hard to stop.
I am seeing a therapist next week (first time with this person), which is making me nervous, which will most likely fuel these dreams and habits.

I'am 34 and have been experiencing depression from the age of 15. on and off medication but have taken med  constantly for 6 years. lately being depressed is still pretty bad some days. I work about 20 hours aweek in cleaning early mornings. lately finding energy to work is getting hard. when I'm at home,getting anything done and finding motivation is pretty tough. I lay down a fair bit and tend to shut myself inside allot. I also have been living alone for ten years and the only family I have is my mum that lives in town.social life is pretty limited apart from trips to town,bills,shopping,things that you have to do. I find it hard to meet new people and I'm abit reserved/quiet. being lonely is something I have felt for a long time.

Hi, 
 
this is is my first time here. I've just recently accepted I'm suffering from depression and anxiety. I've found myself not finding joy in anything. I've also found everything feels harder and burdensome. I even spent thousands of dollars shopping for clothes to make me feel better and the comfort was extremely short loved. I'm worried my work will suffer and my son. Are there people out there feeling the same?

I'm 24 years old and was diagnosed with depression about 3 years ago after getting really drunk at a friend's 21st, getting upset about a boy, crying in the bathroom, and hurting myself. I am on medication and have seen a handful of psychologists and councillors over the years.I'm currently living with my sister and a friend. My sister struggles with terrible anxiety, to the point where she cannot get out of bed some days. My friend I live with also has bad anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and is grieving from her Mother who committed suicide 3 years ago. It is very hard for me to help them when sometimes don't know how to help myself. My mother was diagnosed with Bipolar about 2 years ago after being exposed by another family member with evidence that she had stolen money from my grandmother's bank account. My immediate family and I were all in denial about my Mother's issues for years. My father was miserable in his marriage with her and was having an on-and-off affair since I was 14. My parents only separated 2 years ago. My mother has lost everyone in her life except for my sisters and I. She used to speak to her mother every day and now she's lost her forever. I feel like it has been so difficult because even now still, 2 years later, we have not gotten help for my Mother, and she is too stubborn to listen to me or my two sisters.I know that I need to focus on myself but I find it so difficult with all these people in my life struggling around me. I am currently not speaking to a psychologist or anything. When I feel sad I spend money and treat myself, even though I can't afford it. I'm already in debt and I just can't get on top of it. I seem to always look for quick fixes because I don't focus on the consequences. I don't care enough for myself. My anxiety has stopped me from getting my drivers licence too, I can't get myself to study for the test because I've built it up in my head so much. I don't know why, I feel really stupid for doing things like that. I feel like other people judge me or look down on me.I don't know what I expect writing on this forum but I guess I thought it would be a good idea to try it. I guess it feels good reading other people's stories and realising that I am not alone and that other people can relate. I hope someone out there can relate to me.

Hi all
I'm really down at the moment and feeling like I've hit rock bottom.
Just last week, I was completely fine. Chirpy if anything, and motivated, positive, grateful.
But Ive just had some personal issues arise in my relationship, and back down I go. Which got me thinking, could it be that my relationships or certain toxic people I surround myself with are the cause of my depression? Now that I've had the thought - I am thinking back to the last 7 years in which I've had depression on and off, and the common theme seems to be that there is a certain person on the other side who is causing it in some way.
Despite the subject line of this post, I don't mean to be blaming others and in fact I don't want to. However I'm just wondering whether maybe those others really are the cause of my depression.

Hi I'm 28 and married with 3 kids. My life seems to be great and I feel like I have nothing to be depressed about. But when I do this i get myself in a continuous cycle of feeling bad because I feel bad. I always feel guilty about how my moods effect my wife and kids. The times I get really down anything makes me cry even. Especially when I think about stuff I did yesterday this makes me really upset and makes me wish I could go back and do it again. It doesn't matter what it is. Please does someone have any advice

I'm starting to feel that i'm being consumed by mental health issues, and I feel they have been with me for a very long time. It's almost like it's been programmed into me and i've just found a way to cope with it on a daily basis.
Lately though I know I'm struggling. Everyday seems to be a blur. I feel as if i'm living in state of of being out of body. Almost numb to what's happening around me or to me. It's almost impossible for me to feel any heightened state of emotion. In situations where I should feel happiness, all i can seem to produce is apathy. All day, every day, all i feel is nothing. It's impossible to connect with a fellow human being, and with those I feel comfortable with, I feel whatever connection we have is becoming non existent. 
I'm lost and I don't know what to do.
I can't continue feeling or living my life like this.

Hi there! This is the first time I have reached out to a group like this before. I'm not sure what I am looking to achieve, I guess just to talk.
I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at 13 (I'm 36 soon) I'm an only child and have always been  independant. Sometimes my depression is under control, other times it overwhelmes me to the point where I can't sleep, can't focus, I can't feel joy or even taste properly (does anyone else get this?) only sadness, emptiness, the feeling of not belonging.
To most I am a confident woman. The reality is very different. Ive just learned to cover it up and when it gets really bad, I close the door and hide until the 2nd personality releases me.
I have always had problems maintaining friendships, I find it easy to talk to people, but hard to connect emotionally with people long term. People begin to see me as uncaring and alouf. I've been the focus of gossip and spiteful was from female friends all my life. Perhaps because I don't have normal emotions and don't react the same way as they do. My forced confidence is mistaken for uncaring. Does anyone else feel like this?
At the moment Its like my feelings of worthlessness and emptiness are so obvious to people that I would rather not see anyone. It's like I know I'll be found out if they look in to my eyes long enough, through my fake smile and air kisses. They will see me for who I really am. 
I am paranoid and desperately sad at the moment. I feel like I'm just a blip, worthless and pathetic. This long weekend I have spent on my own, Im finding it very hard being around people because I feel like a fraud, pretending to be normal. I'm trying to keep up my exercise and my work but I'm struggling big time. All I want to do is sleep. 
I know this particular cycle will eventually ease but I don't know how I can ever hold down friendships or a relationship. If anyone has any suggestions or similar experiences I wound really appreciate it. 
Thank you and sorry for the rant!

First of all, greetings. I've looked at the forums several times here, but this is the first time I've posted. I guess I decided to this time because I am no longer so far gone I can't manage to talk to people, but I still have a fight on my hands with my depression and kind of want to compare my experience with that of others.  I know plenty of depressed people, but I also know my own personality and experience with it has differed somewhat from theirs, and a wider pool of people might yield a few that have had a similar run with it to myself. Perchance you know something I don't about dealing with it, or perhaps I know something you can use.
I know a lot of people get lost in the pressing immediacy of depression and can't always recognise it for what it is, when it's happening. It hasn't been like that for me. I've always been been big on self-reflection and have a thoroughly comprehensive knowledge of myself (allowing for the fact there's always more to learn), and am someone who can step outside what is happening and analyse it. There's kind of a two-track process to my depressive episodes: my mind is perfectly functional and alert, and knows exactly what's going on, but my emotions are screaming and crying and flailing their proverbial arms. My body is caught in the middle, usually trying to keep functioning whilst very tired and fighting the urge to curl up and have a little cry, and my mind is left like a captain with a profoundly harried lieutenant trying to bring into line a boatload of underlings who just aren't competent enough to carry out an order.
In many ways it's best that I have my mental faculties in order, but it's stupidly frustrating, even whilst going through it, knowing my emotions are completely out of proportion and that very little of what they're up to is matching up with my cognitive processing of a given situation. By which I mean I've bullied myself into doing what I had to in order to eliminate the things keeping me in the state I was in, but though they're less frequent I still have these bouts of acute depression for no real reason. Before, A+B=C, now I've changed things for the better A+B=Z, and I don't care for it at all. I guess it's kind of an inertia, the effects of everything I've had to deal with are still rolling along though the problem itself is largely resolved. It really is like being two people, sometimes. Do any of you find it like this?

I've never joined or posted in any depression forums anywhere. 
As I sit here, watching TV, watching myself type this, it still feels a bit surreal. What am I doing here? What do I hope to get from this? Will anyone even talk to me? Will I be judged? Will it be seen as a weakness?
Tears well in my eyes, and I find myself once again struggling. Heartbreak has brought me here. But first some brief history. 

I lost my mum many years ago sure to cancer, didn't properly mourn, moved around the country to further my career, burying myself in work, I was running. |
Back in my home city, I kept trying to run, trying to cover the pain with alcohol and drugs until one day I broke down, and had the worst thoughts. 
Instead, I saw a doctor, again broke down, was diagnosed depressive, and placed on medication. 
Skip forward a few years, I'm a reduced dosage, in a great relationship, I started to let the meds run out, on purpose now I look back on it, to see if I could shake this on my own. After a few days each time I would go back to them as the withdrawals made me too light headed and weird. 

I lose my job, but stay on the lighter meds, things get tough, but I stay tougher. The meds run out again, I push through the head spins and feeling weird, I get through the other side, I am medication free, feeling ok.
Then things start to crack, I'm having second thoughts, did I do this too soon. So I go back on them. 
Yesterday, my partner of 3+ years, ended our relationship. I haven't felt this pain since my mother passed and I fear I may go back down the road I was once on. 
I'm so lost, hopelessly lost. I feel like such a failure, a disappointment, and completely worthless. I'm so damn sad, and so damn angry at myself for failing this relationship. 
I know this pain is probably normal in a relationship, but for some reason, this feels different. This feels like someone is sitting on my chest and belting my head around with a leather belt, like punishment. 
I want to shake it, I know I have to shake it, but can't climb out of the hole, I just don't want to do anything but go back to bed.

Hi all!
My name is Brandon. First off I would like to thank anyone who's reading 
this for taking the time to consider and attempt to understand my 
thoughts. 
What I wish to achieve from joining this community I do not 
know, but either way here is some background info about me in attempt to
the clarify the reasons I joined this community: 
- I am 18 and  feel 90 on an emotional level. I can't stop hanging on to some form of a
nostalgic depression. It's comfortable but I know it's doing me no 
good. I can't stop thinking about dying, the legacy I'll leave behind 
and the child of me I left behind. 
When I was 6-7, I witnessed 
my mum getting beaten and abused on a regular basis by my at the time 
step-father. He threatened to kill us one night before we moved out of 
the house. I have a feeling these moments caused a bitter resentment to 
grow inside of me towards myself, my mother and him. I have always 
fantasized about killing him. 
- When I was 8-9, CPS came and 
took me away from my mum and gave me to my grandparents temporarily 
because she couldn't handle her own stresses as well as looking after 
me. I lived with them for a year of much struggle, growth and joy. 
 - The last time I saw my mum was when I was 10, there was a custody 
agreement between my father and her that she would see me every second 
weekend on sundays. She eventually stopped showing up. My Dad and my 
stepmom don't understand how I feel, but I have always felt that since 
that day she never showed up that I have been abandoned.
 - I was bullied extensively throughout my childhood and teens. yada yada 
yada...Regular stuff really...Being called an albino, people constantly 
saying I look way younger than I am, calling me weak, physically 
harassing me, left out of group stuff and in general I just never felt 
like I've been on the same page with others my age especially when 
hanging out in a group. I just desperately want to feel connected to 
someone or something but I can't.  
-The only time I feel like  the true me is when I am drunk beyond belief. Unfortunately, getting  this drunk often results in me breaking down and being reminded of the past.
- An associate of mine committed suicide last year which I felt shook me to the core. I often wish it was me instead of him. At least people seemed to care about him when he was here and when he was gone. 
- I just in general hate who I am and wish to change. I want to love myself and help others love themselves. 
Thanks for reading, K.I.T all.

Hi There,
 This is my first time posting here at BB but have come here to seek help/advice. I have been dealing with anxiety/depression for about 10 years now and have been taking paroxetine for approximately the same time. I have developed excellent strategies for coping over the years which really boils down to routine, healthy eating and exercise. 
However, I have a demon that I cant seem to make progress on: part time alcoholism. I say 'part time' because no-one know's I drink (including my wife) and it happens rarely. I officially 'gave up' drinking almost 3 years ago due to my inability to moderate intake and the effect it was having on my depression and thus home life. I went through a good year or so without having a drink as I had a stable 8-5 job where I got to go home to my wife every day. Things changed when I got a new job which involved significant periods of time away from home either overseas or within Australia. It's gotten to the point where I cannot control myself and every day that I spend away from home or travelling, I drink. I'm not just talking a beer or wine with dinner, I'm talking 15-20 standard drinks in a sitting by myself, every day. 
 I've become so adapted to this way of living that I can seemingly 'get away with it' i.e. my colleagues I travel with don't know I do it and I manage to finance the purchase of alcohol in ways my wife cannot find out about. I know it's doing me damage and it is definitely affecting my professional performance which is adding to my depression and anxiety.
Once I get home and get back into a routine I always seem to conveniently forget about my issues until the next time I travel. The frequency of my travel has increased to about 8-10 days/month rather than previously when it was 10 days every 3 months or so. 
I am finally at the point where I know I have a problem and want to quit drinking for myself, rather than for others and I would really appreciate any advice or feedback from people who have had similar experiences. Should I come clean with my wife or should I battle through this on my own? This is the first time I have shared this with anyone.
 Thanks in advance,

Heya, I'm Beltane. I used to be a Community Champion here on the forums, and I loved talking to people about their struggles with depression and anxiety. I liked to help any way I can. I stopped being a Champion after life got a bit rough.

When I was last here, I was at the tail-end of a failing relationship, struggling to find the will to break it off. I was also only newly employed after a period of unemployment. Suffice to say, I was stressed.

A year later, the relationship is well and truly over, and I'm happy that I ended it, and that we have both moved on (i do not keep in contact). But other than that, I'm feeling quite lost. I feel very much like ""is this all life has to offer"".
My job.... it pays the bills, and it's not the worst job I ever had. But it's so boring, and it's not what I thought it'd be when I left my previous job for it. I've only been in the job a year, and I haven't even finished my studies! So I need to stay in the job until I finish studying, otherwise i can;t finish my studies.... Although it'll only be a few more months at most; it feels like forever. And i don't know what I want to do afterwards.

I have no real friends- just a couple of casual friends i catch up with every few months.. Certainly no-one I feel I can confide in.
I do have on close friend, he's a guy, and he has romantic feelings for me. Honestly, I have no idea what I feel. It seems like my mind is haywire, and i feel like I don't know who I am, what I want, or how I truly feel. Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm crying hysterically. Sometimes I think I really like this guy, other times... well frankly, I become downright abusive towards him. And i have NEVER been an abusive person. But I find myself becoming red-hot with anger towards him, and I have no idea why. He's caring and sweet and lovely, but for some reason, all those traits annoy me. I feel compelled to hold him at distance, push him away, not let him too close. I think it's because he's not perfect, and I can't seem to cope with that. I always find something about him to nit-pick, even if it's something about him I liked the previous day.

I don't have hobbies, I live too far away from things, and I'm too depressed to go anyway. I eat heaps of junk food to make myself feel better, than I feel really angry at myself because I'm gaining weight. I joined a gym and hate going. The highlight of my day was watching my favourite TV show, and i just watched the finale episode. So now what? I'm so unhappy

Hi all
I have depression and generalised anxiety.
Lately I've been feeling much better, and in those times feel quite happy and confident. Yesterday especially, I felt like I was drunk - was motivated, energetic and felt like singing and dancing!
Which got me thinking, what if I have bipolar? I very rarely have these ""up"" moods, and before my depression hit about 7 years ago I was always a happy, confident person. Then I get frustrated with myself because why can't I just enjoy the moment rather than let my anxiety steal it from me.
I did the bipolar test and got a low score but I'm wondering whether I have a mild version of it...

Hey all. First post here. I'm a 33 year old guy and my DAS scores are through the roof for depression. I scored 36 (extremely severe) where the average is 9. I've been in weekly therapy since June last year, but only started on a SNRI last week. I think my therapist has only now just twigged how depressed I am.I have a girlfriend I love very very deeply. She had some of her own issues around chronic illness. Together with my ongoing anxiety (which is now well controlled) a gap opened between us. Three years ago I met someone else and formed an emotional bond that moved into emotional affair territory. At this time I was trying to support my wife through major surgery and couldn't also put all that on her. Anyway, to cut a long story short I completely effed up how I handled things.After my girlfriend recovered I told her what was going on, how I'd tried to break contact several times with this other woman, etc. We went to counselling for a while but my wife was unable to come back from the injury of trust even though I didn't physically cheat. I was just so confused by this point.We split last July. She's in a pretty good place now. We remain friends. I, on the other hand, am completely socially isolated other than her, and right now am feeling hopeless and like I've irreparably ruined the best thing I ever had in my life. I still love her so much. But she is doing well and I don't want to get in her way. We communicate well and there's just no desire there from her to reconnect as lovers. I feel old, hopeless, like I am bad at love, and just basically broken. I don't think I will ever have that kind of connection with another person again. She really is my perfect woman and I can't beleive I made such stupid choices and ruined it all. I'm crying writing this. I kinda don't want to go on. Everything feels meaningless.Seeing my therapist tomorrow. But I need to be reaching out to others too. So, hello.

 Hi my name is Jenny, I am feeling like I have severe depression. I can feel fine in the morning and begin to cry and gradually get worse, until I feel like I cant deal with life anymore.  I see things negatively, no matter what is said and done I either feel alienated or a waste of space. Then I feel so bad for my husband  who listens to my crazy thoughts and I always say the same thing, like how I feel. I cant believe he puts up with me. Anyway that starts the cycle and I feel I just go around and around like a broken record. I am so sick of myself, And I am going to my GP, but thats even a effort, like an anxiety episode, cause Ive got to confess my craziest thoughts. Does that familiar to anybody?

Hi guys,
This is my first time posting in any kind of forum, to be honest. I've struggled with depression and intense anxiety for probably about 12 or 14 years now - since my early adolescence. Although this has really only beig apparent through retrospect. I am in quite a bad lull or hole at the moment - since around Christmas. It's having an absolutely devastating effect on my relationship, my actions, how I interact with the world. I am currently in a really bad stint - the worst in a while. I fear that I am going to make some rash decisions that I will strongly regret later on, but right now my emotions are influencing how I really feel (I think?). I am so inconsistent in what I want and how I feel that it makes it ao difficult to move any direction and I feel helplessly stagnant. My boyfriend only gets frustrated with me, lacks empathy and interprets my depression as a personal reflection of how I feel about him. I try to explain it's not a catalyst of our relationship, and that I would feep this way regardless of whether I was with him or not. Although I really am finding being with him at the moment is making things worse as my deep depression at the moment is really affecting him I think, and he doesn't know or understand how to deal with it. But hia frustration towards me really isn't helping at all. I am so scared of leaving, as over the years I have pretty much pushed all my friends (and kinda my family too) away. I'm afraid to be alone and be isolated with my depression, but I have no interest in socialising right now (thw irony is ridiculous) or doing anything quite frankly. I'm scared I will delve deeper into my depression with nothing to tie my to reality. I feel completely trapped, both by my depression and my feelings (they are constantly changing that I don't know what to believe). I think I have gone through most my adult life trying to please others at a total detriment to myself. How do I learn to love myself? I want to be able to navigate through life independently and not rely on others to keep me from feeling alone and isolated. Right now, I have no idea where to go or what to do.

Hi all, i am a 44 year old male that has visited this site for the first time. Not diagnosed by any professional doctor but suffer from a mild form of anxiety and ocd. Married with 2 teenage kids and our own business plus a 5 acre property to manage on weekends. I am told that when you are in your 40's its the hardest and worst time of your life. Dealing with teenagers, career, aging parents, mortgage etc. I spend most of my day thinking about how great life was a long time ago in my 20's and 30's.  Spend most of my day feeling inadequate in life, to my kids and my wife. Take various herbal or vitamin stress tablets which helps to a degree. Just want to see if i am not alone and there are other middle aged married men like me out there. I am constantly told its just midlife crisis and it will go away. If i knew that was true then i probably could put up with it.

I just want the pain to stop. I am almost being bullied by my team leader and manager. They seem to know just when to stop short and always do it in private. 
I cry most nights. After a comment this afternoon, I left work a bit early, barely keeping the tears back. Now, I can't stop the flood. 
I have no friends I can speak to - I am Aspy as well so don't really do social interactions. 
I got so worked up the other night that I yelled at my poor partner and 7 year old, then cried for three hours straight. They said they couldn't calm me, they could only watch. My partner said just being there, watching my pain was agonising for him too. 
I just want to be happy but I don't know how. Been through so many psychs etc. I just don't think they take me seriously.

Once the sun goes down, that's when I find it hardest to hold out hope. The waves of loneliness, despair, humiliation. I try to push myself to go out, but it's a struggle just looking at all the other happy couples around me, groups of friends, having fun. It's better than staying home by myself, though, and the hours seem to pass a little quicker with distraction.  It always seems to be lurking there, waiting to come back again.

Hello,
I've been struggling with depression for about 10 years or so and haven't sought any professional help yet! I feel I'm a step closer to the actual help I need by telling my problems here first.
 I've hit a low that I just can't shake. For the last few weeks I've been extremely down, some days not even going in to work. The days I do go in, I feel really anxious and nervouse sweaty palms, heart pounding, a million thoughts running through my mind. Then the days I have off I get my children ready for school drop them off and come home and just lay down or sit down in silence and think about everything.... I've had to set an alarm to snap me out of my thoughts and go and pick my children up from school. When they're home I go back to being 'normal'. Ive been getting overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, for some reason I feel like I'm being selfish feeling this way. When I know it's not. I've had some terrible things happen to me in the past which is a major factor in the depressing states I get into sometimes. My children are the reason I'm trying to get help. I don't want them to see the mum broken down all the time. Thank you

Why does mental illness exist? One answer could be it is a form of natural selection. All animals evolve. But I wonder sometimes if our ills or parts of them might not have come from our traumatised childhood caused by bad people or genetics.
 One theory was that man used to protect his family from other people or predators. While stirring his broth, if he was more alert that what was a common level of alertness, he would be more likely to be aware of another caveman sneaking up behind him to steal his stew or hurt his family. This ultra alert frame of mind developed into ADHD as we know it.
Depression with its very high percentage of people suffering it, has eluded the medical profession. However one could argue- in the many hundreds of thousands of years that man has roamed the earth, stress of modern life, diets including soft drinks and high sugar, lack of bonding of people within communities and the almighty dollar that forces us to perform more than ever before, has evolved only within the last few generations…the computer a major contributor only in the last generation alone!! Yet we hop onto that computer train or be left behind.
 
Stress can be a major contributor. Stress- meaning- “a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or demanding circumstances.” Which in my language, how I feel about it is burnout from taking on activities in excess of what I can cope with. Is that natural? I think it is. We are born with limits…we cant all cope with life. We have our limits and then that's it! Some have high limits, some not so high.
 
Narcissists is another example. The need for power over others might have developed within small towns where no one led the people. An opportunist would rise up and in the early days conquer all challengers. Saddam Hussain did this to any rival at all during his reign as did other tyrants. It wasn’t and isn’t acceptable but is it natural? In a world where the strongest survive – yes it must be as it has happened from the beginning of time.
 
And so when suffering depression, blame should never be levelled in the sufferers direction. Therefore you should not experience guilt either for guilt comes from blame. Tell that to some!
 
One can justifiably be at fault when you know you have an illness and you are in denial or you abandon treatment/medication when diagnosis has been confirmed. For then others around you suffer also. That isn’t natural, its inconsiderate. It's a choice

Hey everyone. 
 I am 23 years old and currently have been living in Australia for 2 years (originally from Nz). 
I am set to take the leap over to backpack around Europe and the U.K. In June. I know I should be really excited about this but the last few weeks I have gone so far backwards with my mental health I am scared :( I was taking medication for almost a year and stopped about 5 months ago. I had been doing so well up until recently. 
Again the last few weeks I have lost interest in everything I used to enjoy, I am a emergency vet nurse and seem to have lost all my compassion for the animals I care for at work, I feel like I am going to cry all the time and I have no normal sleep pattern (mainly due to doing shift work) I feel like I need to consider going back on some kind of medications but i am worried about being on medications while away. What if I can't get to a doctor to get a new script? Or misplace my medications in transit and have to go through those horrible withdrawals again? 
 
Basically i just want to know if anyone has traveled while depressed before and especially if you have been taking medications while doing so?
Any advice would really help
 
Thanks

Lately I have been feeling so overwhelmed I can't cope with being alive and escape by sleeping every minute I can. On days I don't have to work I typically sleep until about 11.30am, get up and have something to eat and check on my pets, maybe do something useful like wash up and then I go back to bed where I sleep until about 6.30pm.

I am heartily sick of wasting my days - I have a lot of stuff I have to do, but the temptation to escape it all is overwhelming.

On days I do have to work I find getting out of bed so very difficult, it's the hardest thing I do all day. I try to get to bed at 9.30-10.00pm to make it easier to get up but I think I just hate being awake and conscious.

Does anyone have any tips on how to make engaging with life not seem so awful?

I was doing okay for quite a few months, but now seem to be back in the black hole.

Does anybody else ever feel the pressure to be happy, or even the pressure to just NOT be depressed?
My husband and close friends know I have depression, but sometimes when they ask me how I'm feeling, I just pretend I'm okay. Often I will even respond chirpily to mask it. Partially this is because I can't be bothered talking about it, but sometimes it is partially because I feel pressure to get better, like I know they want me to get better and when I'm not, I guess I don't like admitting it.
It's not so much the stigma that prevents me from being honest, as my hubby and friends are very understanding and don't make me feel ashamed for it. It's just sometimes I feel like I'm a let down for not improving. 
Admittedly, this pressure is entirely self imposed.

Hi guys 
I'm new to BB and have spent the last couple of hours reading some posts by some very brave people. This has given me the confidence to reach out so thank you. 
Like so many of you, my life seems great from an outsider, I have a beautiful supportive wife, we have recently been blessed with a baby boy (8 weeks old), supportive family and great group of friends.
Over the last few years I've been seeing a phycologist to help deal with mild anxiety that I have been getting through work. We've worked on mediation/ mindfulness which seemed to work. I worked in a high paced, corporate sales environment. Late last year in the lead up to the birth of my baby the anxiety for work got a lot worse and I started getting panic attacks. This then turned into depression, fear of not being able to provide overwhelmed me. 
This was scary as I was expecting my first child and my wife and I have had a really tough time getting to this point. I didn't want my negative self talk to cloud this special time. 
GP's have tried some meds, but to be honest I couldn't get through the first couple of days of the meds, I felt like I had completely lost control of my thoughts. So back to focussing on exercise and meditation. 
I resigned from my high paced sales role to shift careers into something I think will be better for me and my family. I start in the new role next week. This decision has been over my head for six months and now that I've made it new anxietys have appeared, will I be able to provide etc. 
Some days I'm up; thinking positively about the next step and challenge, others  I get really low and feel guilty for the potential financial pressure I'm putting on my family. 
We have a huge mortgage, like many in Sydney and I'm scared that this anxiety/ depression will effect me providing for my family. 
I know meds will help the low days and they are starting to get a little worse, but I don't want them to effect my up days, zest for living, energy levels and being able to be present with my family. 
I feel for my wife who has been on this journey with me. I just don't want to bring her down anymore. 
Would love any feedback / thoughts you may have.

Hi all
 
Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety all my life and recently I was diagnosed with bipolar. It's hard enough to have depression and anxiety in this society and to have to add another dignosis to the list makes things even harder for me.
i want to know from other people with similar dignosis in how they go about telling people, the stigma of all of these illnesses aren't very well accepted. Especially when it comes to relationships.
Do you tell people, when do you tell them and how would you approach such a sensitive subject.
how do the medication make someone feel I am yet to go buy them everything is becoming more and more scary for me :(
Any feedback is appreciated
 
thanks all

It's just hit me in the last few weeks that I'm actually depressed. So depressed. I thought I was crazy. My marriage is suffering. I feel like I'm being a distant mum who is adversely affecting my children, I'm a terrible wife and my own worst enemy. I used to be the life of the party, now I avoid a group of friends. We are in couples counselling but I think I am the ultimate problem and need to be in individual therapy to really make a difference. I don't even have a question here...just looking to find out what you guys have done to take steps towards recovery. I'm shocked and in complete despair that I am actually in this situation. I don't feel like I'm me anymore.

Hi Everyone
I have had severe anxiety for 25 years and and depression for 15 years. My anxiety has gone through calm and true acceptance but the depression is still with me and I now understand it may be with me for life. I have read some posts on the BB Forums that it may be hereditary.
Even though at this late stage of my illness I would like to hear people's thoughts on if they think that their depression/anxiety has come from their parents or grandparents. Please share your thoughts.

I don't know where to start. My basic story is that I have had self esteem/depression/anxiety issues for about 10 years (I'm 29) and they have recently gotten so bad that I don't see a way out. Last year I left an abusive relationship and I feel so lonely all the time being single. I just want to find someone who loves me for me and will accept me but I feel like no one will want me when I'm suffering from anxiety and depression. I feel like a burden on all of my family and friends and I feel like they won't want to be around me soon. I try so hard to keep going! I put on a happy face and I don't think anyone would have any idea how bad I feel inside. All of my friends are in relationships and they have their own lives and I just don't fit anywhere. 
 I feel so lost and helpless and that nothing will ever help me and I will never feel better. I just want to give up! I have started seeing a psychologist and she talks about CBT and changing my thinking but that feels impossible when I have thousands of negative thoughts running through my head every day.. I just don't want to feel like this anymore! I don't want to go on medication because I want to be able to get better by myself and not rely on pills to make me feel better. 
 I have been through so much and I just want a break from the bad! I'm miserable and numb and I don't think I can go on.

Hi team,
Over the last few days, I've found myself getting angry/outwardly irritated with those around me.  It has been turning into an argument about how I am not good enough in the situation.  I feel like its a part of my depression, and am having trouble stopping and walking away. 
I wonder - do you have the same problem?  If so, how do you stop it in the moment?  How do you beat it before it happens?  Happy to take suggestions.

I have been suffering from depression on and off for probably more than 30 years. I am 47 now. Last December I was at my worst in a long time and sought a medication review. I am now being monitored for Bipolar II or the second time in my life. Does anyone have any advice on what behaviours I should be monitoring or what I should look back on that I may have missed?

Hi all Just signed up and thought I'd share.
 I am a single mother of three children and have been battling depression 
most of my life. I have been raising my children alone for the past 11 
years and in that time have had only one friend,  but since she moved 
away I haven't had any friends for the past seven years. I live in a 
small town and it's hard to find new friends because everyone has their 
clicky groups. I don't go out because I hate going on my own. The 
hardest thing I find is not having anyone to talk to and do things with,
while everyone else is getting together for coffee and such, I spend my
days off at home either cleaning the house or watching movies. I feel 
I'm destined to be alone for the rest of my life.
So that's me
Looking forward to talking to you

I am tired of this feeling of loneliness that engulfs me daily..  I am sick and tired of feeling resentment towards everyone I have come across in my life who doesn't see what has happened to me.   I am tired of spending my days in a cone of silence.  How many of you haven't uttered a single word today?    What's ironic is that with so little actual noise and stimulation in my life, I want nothing more than for the deafening noise to stop………and yet, tomorrow I have to get up, thankful that the weekend is over so I can go be a highly functioning member of society and maybe engage with people on a professional level.   
 Sorry for the pointless spew, but I can't say these things to my 38 ""friends"" on Facebook or to my Linkedin network…opening up to friends in the past has just shown me that they weren't the friends I hoped they would be so I am not willing to try that experiment again.   I'm glad this place is here so I can say what I need to, but fear it really won't help because the things that depress me are still there and the things I want to silence will continue to make noise...
 Do we get better or is this just a way to kill time?  I wonder sometimes as killing time is really the only thing I truly enjoy anymore...

You’ve been diagnosed with depression possibly anxiety as well beforehand that led to depression. Your Doctor starts you on medication and you return home. You arrive home and the first thing you decide is to ring a friend. But your friend who has a good ear normally cant help you, that’s what they believe. After 15 minutes the conversation drifts off into talking about the nightclub she visited last weekend and the guy she met. You’re alone.
 
The same thing happens with family members but they listen more intently. Over time they too feel the stress of not being able to reach into your mind to fix the problem. Even though they do their best it isn’t enough. You are still alone.
 
You visit your club members. They have a BBQ at a park and show their cars off. You are so much under the dizziness of medication you are emotional. You begin to talk about this to a “friend” and the friend turns to you and says “I’m here for fun and more fun, not to listen to this…snap out of it”!!
 
You prepare dinner and your defacto arrives home from work. He/she listens, you weep and you drink a cuppa. But it seems you cant get enough of their time and support.
 
This process is likely what you are going to experience as a newly diagnosed person with emotional troubles. So here are some tips for those wandering around wondering about their future-
 
1/ Don’t expect anyone to understand Google- “Topic: they just wont understand, why?- beyondblue”
 
2/ Accept your illness. Fighting it wont work and that will be unfair to others in your life “Topic: depression a ship on the high seas- beyondblue” and “Topic: Do we expect a smooth road in life- beyondblue”
 
3/ Expect the future of your illness to be a lifelong management work in progress not something anyone will cure.
 
4/ Be sympathetic with your loved ones “Topic: who cares for the carer?- beyondblue” and “Topic: embracing the embracer- beyondblue”
 
5/ Realise you might need to revert back to some basic living “Topic: MELTDOWN, back to basics- beyondblue”
 
6/ Investigate the positives “topic: Depression, are there any positives?- beyondblue”
 
7/ Become positive “Topic: 30 minutes can change your life- beyondblue”
 
8/ Stick to your doctors orders and visit often  “Topic: medication is a whirlpool- beyondblue”
 
9/ Rely on yourself “topic: the best praise you’ll ever get- beyondblue”
 
10/ Get on with life. “Topic: Getting depression into perspective- beyondblue”
Can you add to this?

I'm nearly 60 & have had depression & PTSD since my late teens. I've had counselling, meds, even ECT. I am so much better than my worst years but the down times still come. If they're short lasting I can manage okay but when the depression really decides to hang around for longer than normal it's tough going. I have so many more coping skills than when I was younger. But when the time drags on I start to doubt - even forget! - that I will get better. Thoughts/tips anyone?? Please.

I've recently been looking into online help options. Nothing so far has been helpful. I need to talk to people that are fighting, or know what it's like. The AA chat room wasn't for me. Too many people talking about unrelated topics. Looking for some real advice and coping strategies. Face to face meetings just aren't for me yet.

I need some short term advice; should I find a counselor where I am right now or head home and find a counselor there?
 I am on a road-trip 'holiday' currently in Hervey Bay. It's a long story but I essentially decided to sell my place, quit my job, take the cash and just go on a road-trip up the east coast in hopes of finding somewhere to disappear to and maybe find a job but really I'm just wandering aimlessly. I've made it from Sydney to Cairns and now heading back down south.
 I've just given up, I'm sitting in a holiday park cabin and I'm literally struggling to move out of bed. I'm struggling to do everyday tasks right now. It's ludicrous and embarrassing. I don't want to sound like a drama-queen or stupid but the best I can describe is that I literally cannot bring myself to leave the cabin, to search online for jobs locally, to walk to the bathroom. I am feeling literally empty, not happy or sad or suicidal, just completely empty and given up. As dramatic as I sound, this is literally how I feel and I cannot bring myself to do anything.
 Is this depression or something. It would be great to know what the hell is happening to me right now and what I should do?

I had depression for many years after losing my parents, I had several disasterous relationships including a marriage that was devastating.  I fled my marriage with nothing, changed my job, got a dog and started to rebuild my life.  As silly as it sounds having my dog really helped lift my depression (I really worry sometimes about how I will cope if I lose her one day as I adopted her as an older dog) and while I am aware it can always come creeping back in it is nowhere near as intense as it used to be and I feel content most days now.  What I am unable to do however is to form another relationship, I have no friends, family or partner.  I tried to date but really just don't feel up for it, everytime anyone expresses any interest in me I just bail out afraid of coping with what could just become another emotional rollercoaster.  I was always in relationships from 17 to 40 and I don't mind being on my own now, I have been alone for four years now and I have my pets and feel safe and settled, I'm afraid if I let someone in it will disrupt all the harmony and peace I have created, I feel like I am still in the process of rebuilding my life and finding out who I really am and what I really want.  I don't have family and only one or two acquaintences, no real friends.  I'd like to make a few friends but don't trust people much and seem to get used and treated badly by people I try to befriend.  The last two people I have tried to befriend have borrowed money or items from me and not returned or repayed them, I just feel used so now I don't even bother trying.  I love my pets and I run, swim, cycle and go bushwalking and sightseeing but everything I do I do alone.  At work I get along with most of the people I work with but my field is male dominated and the only other female I work with is a really unpleasant person so I don't get along with her so have no female friends, just a few male acquaintences.  Sometimes I feel a bit sad that I am so alone and have noone to 'shoot the breeze' with so to speak or talk over issues or see a movie or go out to dinner with but then I remember all the pain and turmoil and think I am better off safe and at peace.  I wonder if how I am is okay, everyone else seems to have to have lots of people about and I don't. I'm not sure anymore if the way I live is healthy for my state of mind or not as it seems just normal to me now to be alone with noone and cope with absolutely everything on my own?

Hello all
 So on the weekend I had a family get together, which I brought my gf to. I love her dearly.
After a couple of glasses of wine with lunch, I secretly went to the garage and skulled two bottles of wine. When my gf asked me what was wrong I lied and said nothing was wrong. I said I hadn't been drinking. I never lie other then when I drink and feel ashamed. 
Ieffectively abandoned her at my family get together, and she had to drive me home. She can no longer trust me when I am drinking, and I feel a have really betrayed her.
I have historically been an alcoholic, and probably a drug addict. Now I hardly drink, but feel like I want to about once a month to check out from the world.
I have changed my life incredibly, I meditate, go to gym, and engage with the world in a much more healthy manner.
This slip up has made me feel very poorly about myself, especially how I lied to my gf and family. I regret my actions, and feel depressed and anxious about life in general.

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety and over the last week made a big turning point where I am feeling a lot better. My thinking is clear I'd say about 85% back to normal, I'm eating and drinking properly and have kicked the alcohol.
However I feel terrified of going back to where I was and I feel like I'm desperately clinging on to how I feel now as I'm afraid if I let my guard down I'll slip back to the black wave
I also have no confidence whatsoever. The fire I'm my belly to achieve and get out there whether it be work study or otherwise seems to be gone.
I lead a simple life. I get up of a day go for a refreshing walk or bike ride, do some cooking, catch up with friends for lunch,  do school pick ups, after school activities, take photos of the sunset and other scenic shots. Finish the day with a good meal, a good book and repeat. That's all I seem to be interested in.
But I have mortgages, responsibility and a good career - I can't understand how I have no desire to do anything about this.
Any suggestions? Is this normal?

Hi. I am a 44 year old female who has been diagnosed with depression for 20 years. I have been on and off meds over the years and tried numerous drs also. No luck really. It never goes away. It's just some days I cope and a lot of weeks I don't.
Most days i bite my lip and carry on. Recently i am finding that harder day by day. 
I have had recent relationship issues and broke up with a partner of 10 years and am now with an old partner who i have recently discovered is an alcoholic. Last week I was made redundant from my job and yesterday i found out my mum has 6 months to live. That tunnel of blackness seems to have no end in sight. 
Its hard enough to cope under normal circumstances and now i feel like i am terrified of every new day. So much so that i dont want to go to bed. 
any tips?

Hello! I suffer from depression and anxiety and feel so lonely. Up until recently I've realised that for a long long time I have preferred being by myself. I would rather be at home watching movies or meeting with a friend. I have no motivation to get out there. I had really bad anger outbursts with my family and I wouldn't talk to one of them if I felt that they hurt me. I would become angry when things trigger other things and would feel like no one cares or understands me. I would then feel guilty for putting my problems on them. I am a private person. I don't like people knowing things about me. I can remember being depressed from when I was maybe 10. It wasn't until I was about 19 that I remembered that I was molested as a child. I realised why I was always scared of intimacy, I told a boy that he can sleep with me but he can't touch me. I wonder if I will be alone forever.

Hi all
 not posted for awhile as things have been ok , not great but better.
my main issue at the moment is that when i start to have an episode (which is happening now) i start to let my mouth run away with me.... i cant seem to stop telling my wife all the bad things i am thinking and how i think she does not love me or support me, then that turns into to her getting upset then turns to arguing... i cant seem to get this under control and she does not know how to deal with me when i'm like this .... she asks me what she can do and to be honest i dont always know myself..... i seem to want to bring people down to feel like i feel and knowing that make me feel like a bad person :-(... this usually ends in us not talking to each other and she just walks passed me when im sat on the bed (i spend alot of time in the bedroom when down) and that makes me feel like she doesn't care.
also i have to really try and stop myself (this doesn't always work) from just telling her i want our relationship over .
 i presume this is common fight or flight response ... does anyone else act almost nasty when down ? how do i control my mouth ? i have thought about going away when this happens, but it's not practical as we have young children and i take them to school .
my wife is in a no win situation if she leaves me to it i resent her for not comming to 'help' me if she comes near me sometimes it helps but sometimes i lash out and she feels that she can do no right.
i hate the fact my depression in time will end my marriage, i exercise for 1 hour a day , i have lost weight all these things have helped as i do not need meds anymore (or at least its manageable)  but this nastyness is really affecting her 
 
Cheers Martin

Im 26 and i feel like ive just drifted past my youth without inventing myself into the person i was suppose to be. My parents made every decision for me and im so lost with no sense of personality. Ive felt like i do what is expected of me and im just sick of it all. My father is abusive and disregards my life. He makes a shitload of money and makes me feel guilty for taking his money. I know im just feeling sorry for myself and i have no one to blame but i just cant help feeling so bad for myself im 26 and ive done nothing for myself.

Hi all, me agian.
I have been seeing a psychologist for the past 12 months as well as my normal psychiatrist, (she felt her alone was not enough) and have made improvements. but.
I feel at times that I am not getting anywhere.  Yesterday was a typical example.  I met two friends for lunch and it went well, I felt ok and was able to enter into the conversation rather than sit back and say nothing, which I use to do. I cracked jokes and the others laughed so that made me feel good to.
Then I went home and feel flat, I was teary, panicy and felt hopeless about my recovery. (I love my little flat and my cat so being home is not the problem and I do like my own company). I seem to have come some distance towards recovery which hasn't happened in many, many years.  
I feel like there is something wrong with me.
Do others go up and down like this in one day?  I suppose I want to know if I am alone in this or is it normal.
Thanks BBers
Anne

We all have days where we wonder why we even decided to get out of bed!
This is your opportunity to share the bad and the ugly...but you also have to write down what was GOOD about that day or event!
I will give you an example:
 Recently I was doing 110 k.m. (As allowed in S.A.) on a highway when my front right tyre blew out. I was able to control the car and pull off the road. I was not far from home so called my husband to help me change the tyre.
He said ""Looks like you are having a really bad day!"" I thought about it and yes, it was not a pleasant event and it was 42 degrees and I was exhausted after work and just wanted to get home.
The bad news is the tyre was totally shredded, the good news is I did not run into any of the oncoming trucks and the car behind me had slowed down enough for me to dart off the road in an erratic manner.
The bad news was it was extremely hot, the good news is it didn't take long to change the tyre and we were soon back in air conditioned cars.
The bad news is that it cost money to repair the slight damage to the car and replace the tyre, the good news is my pay covered the repairs.
The point is I could have allowed this event to totally destroy my mood for the day, but I tried to look on the bright side of things.
Please share your stories here and remember to try and come up with a positive at the end! It is not always easy to see the sunshine through the storm clouds, but if we look hard enough we can find a ray of positivity and hope!

Hi everyone,
My name is Benjamin. I'am new to these forums and would appreciate some help in understanding depression. 
I was recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Though i believe i have lived with it for years. Gradually it got more severe until i had to reach out. One thing i have noticed is it affects me in waves, which have also gradually become more rapid over time. One day i would feel very low and would believe i cant cope, i cant go on. The next day facing the same problems as yesterday i would feel confident i could get through life, it wont be difficult and i can handle it. The day after low and losing all hope.
In the present these waves can occur several times in the one day. Or disappear for days at a time returning with extremity. It plays havoc on my life and personality.
What i would like to know is why the waves? And is there anybody else who gets waves like this and have they any tips on dealing with them? I hope one day to experience smooth sailing and not these rough seas.

Hi have spent easter on my own 4 days didnt really talk to anyone barely went outside - isolation as usual
 Am 36 next week, am living in a hotel room, upstairs and the hotel is actually the place i work (boss giving me a place to stay).
Im only getting 10 hours a week too, and this week it looks like im going to be put on ""work 4 the dole"" grrrrrrrrr
Dad lives in central australia is uncontactable, mum has passed and i have no brothers or sisters
 girlfriends come & go but am tired of explaining my homelessness & lack of employment to them, 2015 brought 3 heavy break ups, the first girl was from a 4 year relationship, the other 2 were 6 month relationships
 am really in a dark place now, losing purpose in life, have no idea of a career direction
 am a talented footballer, but am being kept off the field by knee tendinitis & sciatica, else id be playing div 1 amatuers
anyways this is me, this small hotel room is making me feel more and more caged in everyday, but i am unable to share houses with people their annoying habits enhance my anxieties and i bail from these homes. getting my own place is impossible without employment 
my thoughts are sometimes quite dire, i wouldnt wish my isolation on anyone, dont know how to get out of these empty depths

I was having a Messenger conversation with my closest friend, she has been a great support and thought she Got me, until last night.
The last ccouple of weeks have been better, l know shock, and l thought I had turned that corner. This friends sister even commented on how good I looked.
Last couple of days haven't been good, have felt 
really low again, fortunately I know the trigger but even knowing hadn't helped.
I told my friend I was feeling low again
, and how l thought l had finally turned the corner then she said 'depends on how much you want to turn that corner' then she immediately said Be strong. I think she realized she had said the wrong thing but I still felt hurt.
Do you have to have depression 
to understand what someone else is going through? Feel like I can't talk to her anymore. I am not going to lose her friendship but l feel different towards her now. Am l being to sensitive?
Has this happened to any
one else? What did you do? I feel mire weird than ever now.

Everything 'should be' great in my life! I have a wonderful wife, 4 beautiful kids and am 'successful'. I also an overwhelming sense of sadness and a deep sense of insecurity that everything will soon wrong. 
I live in Melbourne, yet, for the last 3 years, have worked in Canberra - a different city! What started as Mon-Thurs afternoon away turned into Sunday night to Thurs night and sometimes Friday. Nightly Skype calls to 'see' my family turned into intermittent phone calls and now I often go for the week without speaking to my family; just texts for the logistics. I have now been away from home for 600 nights over the last 3 years, including 300 flights. I've also had to deal with my father getting dementia, looking after him (from Canberra as best I could), VCAT hearings against one sister (a recovered drug addict) to offer the best care for Dad that my other sister and I could find, then having him pass away in Aug 2014. I then became sole Executor and discovered a lot about Dad I never knew - his emotions, the 50 year-old love letters between Dad & Mum (divorced 35 years ago) he kept, the fact he retained every single letter, Christmas Card that any his kids ever sent him, even a poem about death that he wrote and I read at his funeral . . . He had an emotional and compassionate depth I never saw or knew about and it saddens me that we never talked about it. During this, I felt my wife didn't give me the emotional support/outlet I needed and craved. 
Shortly after Dad passed, a member of my team in Canberra was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I never knew how to handle this with the rest of my team, but tried as best I could; provided support to the rest of the team etc. He passed away in Feb 2015. This was on top of another member of my team who was diagnosed with terminal cancer 3 years ago, but lived until passing away last month. Now my wife's father has been diagnosed with dementia. I want to make sure I'm there for her. 
This has CHANGED me. I am irritable, moody, frustrated, cry often (to myself, even if for 30 seconds having had a thought about Dad or one of my team), am drinking more alcohol more often in Canberra. I have sought emotional support from those around me in Canberra, that I wasn't getting by not being; not have I been cut any slack from my employer - which, by the way, wanted to 'get rid of' the second team member some time ago and, when he stopped turning up to work, I hid from HR to protect him and his family. Am I normal?

Hi
I am unsure how to start...my husband wants me to harden up and just be happy. I think he's tired of me being the way i am, but i am too and don't know how to be happy all the time. Sometimes I'm happy and other times i can't help myself be happy. It feels like I'm expected to snap out of it...i wish it worked that way. I don't like being this way and feeling like I do, and he is understanding and nice to a degree, but i don't know how to get myself happy all the time so that he's not disappointed with me for not being a 'normal' person. I just want him to understand that it's not that easy.

I have had depression since 2010, granted it has been relieved at times and also reared its ugly head in two big episodes of depression. I've been on antidepressants now for the majority of the past 6 years and have changed them throughout the years.... I have low times where I just want to avoid things of responsibility like driving, work, cooking, cleaning and well life. I have avoided driving to much that now I get very anxious about having to drive to new places even though deep down I know I can drive well and that nothing terrible can happen it's like a protective bubble I put myself in to avoid to much stress and becoming depressed but in the process I become 😒 Depressed I guess because of the avoidance behaviour. I also avoid work as well when I feel too anxious and that is when it causes problems at home and at work. I guess what I am trying to get at is perhaps being on antidepressants and this avoidance behaviour is actually preventing me to feel what I need to feel. Maybe I need to feel more so my body and brain and adapt to life... I am starting to think this bubble I have created is not me anymore and I just want to be me.... I guess I want to feel anger, stress, excited, happy, loved.... All of that and more but I can't feel any of that and haven't for years. I know that things in life I experience I should be feeling a certain way but I just feel nothing. I was got married years ago and did not enjoy the day, I didn't experience happiness. I just want to feel again and I want help with this so badly.

Hi Everyone.

I am new to this forum. thank you for having me here. I hope as well as receiving advice and support that I can also give helpful advice and support as well.

I am currently feeling a bit ""All over the place"" at the moment. and my mind is constantly trying to break me down. telling me, i'm hopeless pathetic and worthless, then other times I feel okay, not on top of the world but just okay - I am just wondering does anyone else have this experience with depression or any other mental illness, okay one day, rock bottom the next.. ? It's as if I am caught in a whirl wind that is my mind. its exhausting and confusing. but most of all i feel like i should be able to be 'good' 'happy' all the time. and i'm not. 

any words would be greatly appreciated. is it normal to feel quite all over the place? 

Thanks everyone.

I haven't been on the site for a while. I've been working on myself and trying to be better, but the last couple of days I've gone backwards.
there was about a week where I can say I was genuinely happy, I was blissfully unaware of depression or anxiety. I was eating and sleeping well, I was interested in things and people. But all it took was one conversation for these feelings to begin to come back. Gradually my feelings towards myself have gotten worse again and now I'm starting to feel these anxious feelings returning too. It's been happening slowing and I've been trying to curb it.
Lately I've been becoming more and more critical of my appearance. I'm also worrying more and more about my health. I tell myself I'm going to do things to make my lifestyle more healthy, but I can't force myself to actually do them.
I feel like there is an answer somewhere to how to be happy with myself. Other people seem to be happy. Other people seem to be able to accept aging or the changes in life. i feel like I'm peddling the wheels but I'm not getting anywhere.

Hi everyone,
 I have suffered from depression and anxiety for 15+ years, starting as a teenager.
I have always managed for the most part, though lately it is getting the better of me.
I am a single mum, with a very lacking ex who does not make time for the kids, nor helps me with them and does not help financially, so I don't get a break. 
I have no family - except a mother in law that is 1400kms away - and she has her own issues, so I really hate to burden her.
I want to join some groups, but find it hard to find kid friendly, low cost options.
so here I am, hoping to find some like minded people to rally with and talk to when I feel so low and just need human interaction - without the online chats who just seem to want to talk sex all the time - and maybe lead to some RL friendships.
I have separated in the last few months - after 11 years - it was my decision and I was quite happy about it, but he is very good at manipulating me and with my depression I can be very easily led, hence his mind games have sent me into a downward spiral, I really was in a nice place, getting my life in order, reaching out to new social circles, however now I just want to roll into a ball and not move - I know it's just the depression, but I just can't function or get past it.

Hi, I am 26 years old. I have not been officially diagnosed with depression, but identify with a lot of its symptoms. I have problems with yo yo dieting and binge eating, to the point where it sometimes makes me ill. On the weekends I don't feel like doing anything but going to bed or watching TV. I have a job that can sometimes be stressful and it gets to me so much that I become a blubbering mess! 
I am married, have a new, beautiful house, and a pretty good job. I shouldn't feel the way I do. My husband tries to make me feel better and tries to understand it but mostly it just makes him frustrated and helpless. In turn this makes me feel guilt for bringing him down with me.
I have seen two different psychologists, each time helping me to deal with different issues. They both suggested that I take up a new hobby. But each time I think of doing it I have no motivation.
I don't want to feel like this anymore. I would really appreciate some advice on how to not allow depression to take hold.

I use to always be a happy person and was called smiley before but now I don't see myself even looking at myself in the mirror anymore. I've been depressed since I've been 16 and now I'm 24 I suffer from anxiety and I've finally decided to take medication to help me and so far it has been helping me little by little each day. I see a psychologist every now and then but feel like I always need to vent ALOT because I'm such an emotional person and I feel so much better when it is out. This drives me crazy as a person. I feel like my personality as a person makes me crazy at times its like I can't be happy anymore. I'm a social person and I feel so depressed all the time when I don't get enough interaction in my day or when I'm left alone for a couple hours in my day... I hate it. I hate being alone. I hate living in this isolated area and being away from people. When I don't talk to someone in my day it drives me crazy I just want to drive somewhere and TALK. I've been very confused about which career to do for many years now and I struggle making decisions and anxious about making wrong choices. I've done a few different careers and I don't want to be a failure again. I either get bored from the job or feel like I need more talking in the job. Every job I've done I've legit hated and it has made me depressed all the time. I sit at tafe and I feel so costriphobic being in a classroom all day and sitting on my ass.. I hate it.. I hate studying and have never liked school.. I'm not enjoying tafe and I don't find it fun at all.. I hate it so much but I do it because I'd rather be depressed in class then be depressed sitting at home. I will be worse. I'm so outgoing, hands on and I value my freedom heaps. Is anyone out there feel like me? Can anyone relate to this? My personality drives me crazy! I feel like my heart is a ghost town.. Forever depressed and I never find anything I'm passionate about or LOVE. How long do I have to be miserable for seriously?

So, what next?
 I have been on medication for 4 months and feel better for it aside from the side-effects.
I have seen my psychologist every fortnight as well which has been challenging, uncomfortable, rewarding, safe, and even a couple of funny moments thrown as well.
Thing is I don't feel as down or sad as I used to, but don't feel happy either - am not sure what that means. Therapy seems to be going well, but I'm left wondering what next?
She has progressed me to mindfulness - ie being the moment be it work, family, friends or by myself > am trying, but it is hard when I'm used to going at life at a million miles an hour.
Have been compliant with my self-care plan - exercise, rest, sleep, etc.
Work has been ok, reduced hours to 45-50/week, but am finding motivation problematic. Have never been one to procrastinate, but seem quite good at it now. Breaking things down, lists etc are getting me through.
I know that things will improve with time; I get it is ok not to be ok; I get that that if we're a magic solution to depression someone would have provided it by now.
But when I was undiagnosed, miserable, and at risk at least I had that...now I just feel like a rudderless ship.
Just re-reading this post I'm rambling a lot - sorry, not very readable, but maybe a reflection of where I am.
Thanks for reading
 
Vita

Hi, for about a year now at least once a week I wake up and just feel like everything is a effort and I get really frustrated with everything even if it is just someone walking past me. Sometimes it gets so bad that I flip out on my partner and start getting physically aggressive and then after the fight I would go to our room and ball by eyes out for at least half an hour.
 
Have no idea what is happening to me to make me do this, need to understand what it could be.

I've had depression as far back as I can remember. It gets a bit better at times and then really bad. At the moment it's ok just paralyzing. I can't seem to do anything, stuck in the same position day after day. I try to better my life but the only thing I seem to be able to do at the moment is walk which gives some relief but then I have to go home and can't go for another walk until the next day. I try to do productive stuff at home but it seems pointless. Too hard. I have four kids aged 10 to 5 months and my partner is unemployed and at home 24/7. I think he's depressed too but won't admit it. I need to learn to drive, need to bring in money but it all seems like such a heavy weight I end up just pottering around the house until I collapse into bed at night waiting for my walk the next day so I can feel a bit better again. It's too hard to see a psychologist at the moment and when I think about going back on antidepressants I consider the side effects like persistent tiredness I get when on them and little relief with the down mood. I've tried a number of them and only had one with any good effect but still has the negative side effects. What are my other options? Is there a way I can pull up out of this without medication and psychotherapy? I'm so tired of feeling like everything is too hard and too much.

I have depression for years. I have tried to talk to my family and friends. Now most of my family ignore me , all my friends have moved and not given me there new addresses. One who really understood because she was going through similar stuff. Both of us would be there for each other. Unfortunately passed away. I found out her story and supported her and she me. Now I don't have anyone when I need to vent to vent off steam. I don't wish to lay it on my children.

Hi,
I'm new here. I have depression. I feel that there is not one person in my life that understands how I feel, and why I can't just ""get over it.""   So here I am - now surrounded by you, who understands. So first of all, thanks.  
Quick background. My depression became significantly worse about 8-10 months ago.  I was at a workplace with a toxic culture where I was the new person, and the hierarchy said that I should be told I wasn't good enough for years before I got a permanent job (I was on very short term contracts).  I know its not personal, its just the industry, but I couldn't keep taking the rejections and the negativity, but I definitely couldn't make it known to those at work, so I slid.  I slid into a depression where I hated going to work.  I was constantly told that I should be happy because, after all, I had the dream job.  
 My boyfriend at the time kept saying he understood, but in reality he had no idea.  If I was having a bad day, he would say that I'm inconsiderate because I'm not thinking about how he feels when I'm being difficult.  I loved him, so of course, I told myself that it was my fault.  I told myself that he was really supportive, because at times he did try and make me feel better, but in the long run, it wasn't good for me at all.  
I have two close friends.  One is extremely kind and although she hasn't had depression so doesn't fully understand, she is always willing to listen .  The other one is very judgemental about mental illness (I watched how she treated another friend with severe depression), so I don't really talk to her about this.  I do have one other friend who suffers from anxiety who I am very grateful for.  But these friendships have their limits.
Fast forward.  I am feeling better than 4 months ago, but I know I'm not there yet.  The short-term contract work-I am now without a contract (no guarantees when the next contract will be), living in a home with a controlling sister (who does not understand depression, and unfortunately not willing to try), and a mum who has had mental health issues for 20+ years (who understands, however imagine us if we both have really bad days on the same day).  I can't leave because I don't have a stable income.
I am terrified that too much time home alone will allow me to get in my own head.  To spiral backwards.  To slip back into day-in, day-out, curled up on the couch feeling completely worthless.  There are things to do, but I'm finding it hard to motivate myself.

Hi all! This is a very condensed version of what has happened but I am in my 50's and had to leave work after being bullied. I got a small payout but after 18+ months not working, I have used up every bit of savings and am now living day to day financially. I have tried working manual jobs because I don't feel like I could cope working in the industry I was in, but my body just cant handle it for long periods of time. I have set up a small business but the income is very inconsistent. One close family member has discommunicated me (is that a word?) after I went through a paranoid/delusional period which was more painful than I ever imagined and has given my family and friends their version of what my 'problem' is. 
So without consultation or discussing my needs with me or even my diagnosis, they arranged to bring me 'home' and offered to buy me a ticket. But this would mean giving up my very cheap accommodation, and my dog, the few friends I have and I would have no means of financial support. And now I am feeling a bit pressured because every time I talk to them I am asked if I miss home, I get a barrage of family pics and I get the impression they think I'm just mismanaging my life rather than coping with PTSD and severe depression (which is what the professionals say), not to mention my physical limitations which are also being minimised.

I have worked so hard to stay out of hospital and have joined a support group, take my dog and therefore myself for walks, and generally am trying my hardest to get better. So I feel that this attitude is keeping me down rather than picking me up. Nobody asks how I am doing, or what will help, and conversations are cut short if I ever mention my mental health and steered back to general safe subjects. On the other hand, I have reconnected with a dear friend who is incredibly supportive. I'm now wondering if it is my depression that is making me think this way, or would it be better to avoid my family for a while?

Hi, I have a great life; a wonderful husband, kids, job I love, house I love, pets. From the outside I could look like I have it all.  I'm so exhausted from battling the negative emotions and feelings of not being liked/accepted. I've done so much counselling and self work through my life I know all the things I should be saying to myself and deep down I know how loved I am by my family. Why can't I stop these feelings of worthlessness??
it was pounded in to me by my mother - I'm worthless, I have a terrible personality, it's a wonder I have any friends... I cannot overcome these fundamental beliefs.  I can make friends fine but can't seem to hold them.  I think I'm too needy, overshare, clingy? Then every time I get dropped by a friend all the things my mother told me become reinforced. I beat myself up for ages about what I did wrong, how it was my fault. I wish I could just shake it off.
i am currently feeling so worthless, disliked and ganged up on.  How do you get all the mantras/work you've done to actually change your patterns? I'm feeling so hopeless.

Anyone influenced by their music, or do they think their emotions, dictate their music?
I'm feeling like sometimes my music dictates my mood, and other times my mood dictates what I want to hear. I sometimes listen to sad music, and it puts me in a space, UN-attached from my emotions, but I feel the mood and context of the music subjectively, other times, I hear the tonality, and it changes my mood/and, or perception of my 'self' mood, then there are times, I clearly perceive the difference between which is dictating which. and those days are really hard for me to get through, because I feel happy, I know things are good, and I just have a niggle that pushes me one way or another, and I then somehow, WHOLEHEARTEDLY fall into that grade in my mentality, and sometimes that can really put me into a week/month long mood of said period. 
Example; start Jan. Mediocrity, ensuing, personal AND family, AND best friend issues lead to mediocre end Jan, birthday call to dad.
1 wk before partners b'day, few drinks, next day kids, school, nothing SPECIAL, quick bite out with partner, time, between1-2:30, feeling loss of perception of self, something weird, loss of visual focus, to the point of grasping partners arm and making him stop to let me get my grounding. He was a total champ on HIS birthday for ME, because some kind of stress just GRIPPED ME, thankgod he drove home.
then for a week or 2 after that, just didn't feel like myself, AT ALL, and felt like I was seeing everything from the outside perspective, and not understanding certain choices of my own making.
then things STARTED getting better, and some skin condition on my hands errupted, now still falling a little behind in planning an 8 yr old's birthday, for fear of not having given her a fun-filled child-of own age- ridden party YET. the school mothers are mostly what scares me the most about that, I fear by April, I will be too burnt out for my own birthday to do anything other than sit in a corner rocking, and my partner love him, will do whatever I want, I know, but for now my freak-out is trying to help my child. HOW do parents cope with these situations towards their child? how do you handle the stress and then explain it to a 5 and 8 yr old, or not, but put it into their perspective, without awakening something that may haunt them? without making them worry or think they'll genetically inherit nuances? so does this pre-dispose them by nurture or nature? They more prone genetically or thought-influenced?

Hi my name is Brett
i have just recently diagnosed with server depression, I don't know what really to say but my wife said to do something about and I'm trying my hardest. Don't want to lose her or my daugther. I've been on medication for two days and my thoughts are just relying on the medication, but I don't know what else to do.
I don't know if anyone knows how to help but everyone is trying to.  Just feel like crying all the time just feel like I'm a failure I'm not a good dad husband work, feel like I'm a failure as a person, I get angry with everything I do, feel like putting a few holes in the wall then I brake down and cry just want to b left alone just hate feeling like this, and it's to do with my past as well, and how I am financially with debt feels like I let my family down everyday with everything I say or do, I don't know what to say or do without thinking it's going to cause a problem or a fight or something that I'll hate myself more. That's y gave up football last year and gave up gym I just don't believe anymore. And I'm scared that I'm going to do the same to my family and don't want to do that my girls. But I can't stop the way I'm thinking and feel and how I get so angry with everything I do. Feels like I'm walking around on eggs shells waiting for someone to have a go at me every minute. If someone says I've done a good job I still think I could've done better and hate myself for it. I had a panic attack which I never had before signing happy birthday to a follow colleague had to walk out felt like I couldn't breath. I get angry during the night while I sleep my jaw hurts coz I clinch my teeth my wife says I get all tense and scared of waking me, I wake up angry one day or wake up upset another day.
 
dont know what else to do 😞
Sorry

I honestly thought this was a support site where desperate people like myself could connect in desperate times but all I received was an email telling me that I would be contacted soon....that contact from this site never came....not for me!

I am feeling really down & hve that emptiness feeling, I only hve a cpl of friends & they find it hard to understand what I'm going thru. I am now on my 3rd lot of medication this one taking 4wks to work now starting the 4th week I still feel like there is no change. I cope thru the wk due to work but the weekends are the worst, I use to play indoor national netball but due to so many injuries I can't play anymore, I have a PT at the gym I go once a wk but I am so exhausted to go more times. I am tired when I go to bed but when I put my head down I am wide awake even with several sleeping pills. When I do go out with the cpl of friends I have it's normally really good as we do things (go to their place, go shopping - small outings) but I am feeling so low lately even my partner who I don't live with is supportive but at times finds it very frustrating. I am trying to save to move out of the parents in with my partner but being burnt from other partners I am very hesitant which I feel a burden to my partner that I am scared he will end it even thou he says he wont. I am very shy that in a large group I clam up but with one or two ppl I am ok, I want to get out and do something a hobby or a sport I can do with my injuries {knee and shoulder} but I do not know what to do ( I'm certainly not an arts & crafts person lol) When ppl do ask me to go out to say tupperware parties I am in one of my moods where I just dont want to go, they try & after several attempts of trying to get me to do things they give up needless to say they end up drifting away and most of the time it is just me & my partner which gets very boring as we always do the same things all the time. I like being around other ppl and by the time sunday comes around I long to be back at work to be around ppl to challenge my mind push myself etc. I find I am in a rut & have been for many years I have seen a physiologist but find it better if I am doing things surround myself with ppl doing small outings like going to the fireworks etc I am a very simple girl I just don't know what my interests are or what to do.

Hi guys I am now a member. I have been reading everyone forums on line and it made me feel a little better about my self knowing that there are actually people I can talk to going though the same thing as me. My name is Bonnie I'm 26 always knew I had a bit of a problem until one day it just took over my life completely. I wouldn't wish it apon anyone. The last couple of years I just shut everyone out of my life knowing I couldn't pretty much leave my house and that empty feeling inside feeling sad all the time over thinking things and sometimes feeling like your going crazy. I finally went to my doctor and admitted that something was wrong. I now have to go see a special doctor but haven't made the appointment yet I'm a little scared it about it is it going to help me.

I work in hospitality and am in my late 40's. My wife also works with me. Our General Manager has all the classical symptoms of a sociopath. Our staff are bullied and constantly abused. I have endured a fluctuating period that flows between being a respected member of management to being an employee who feels that their days are numbered. This is a weekly cycle that I have endured for over 4 years. I must add that my actual workload is stressful enough. My days off now find me confined to bed so as to escape the reality of my world. I drink too much alcohol and look at suicide as a credible option because I don't know what I can do to escape this lifestyle without sacrificing income and at my stage of life I don't know where I can source income for the future. I wonder if my circumstance is unique in this industry but sadly it appears that it is not.

I dont want to feel this way anymore, i cant stop being paranoid about things going wrong, especially with my friends. I feel so alone and stupid... why do i feel so out of the loop. I thought this would be over, that i would have a new start since leaving school. All my friends are fine, they are coping with their depression... then why dont i believe them? I have the horrible feelings something is going to go wrong...Im going crazy. I tried counselling and that made me more anxious, now im thinking of medication... but im scared of the side effects. I am so tired, i am exhausted of feeling so alone and paranoid. I want to be happy... but i cant... I want to talk to my best friends but somehow i feel like they dont really care... or that they can't cope. They've gone through the same things but i feel like they lack empathy... like i'm supposed to be the strong one. But i can't be the strong one anymore. 
Im sorry if this doesnt make sense, it hardly makes sense to me... i'm so confused.
please help, i've run out of coping mechanisms... ive been doing this alone for too long... i can't do it anymore. I need help.

Ok, so I come on to this site to make a thread about my situation I don't feel comfortable talking about it to my parents from what I know they don't understand what I'm going through ever since I have been around 10 I have suffered badly with OCD and been a grim freak, which has taken over my life and coming into my teenage years I got really bad anxiety and I couldn't focus on school or get interested in it because of my anxiety I dropped out of year 11 it was too much for me to deal with and I didn't get any help before I dropped out which I regret I thought dropping out would help my anxiety not been around a lot of people and working for my dad, but working for him for 2 years now my life has gone downhill allot, I'm 20 now and I don't have a drivers license and the people that work for my dad give my lot of anxiety because the way they go about things and there life style I don't really have any friends anymore, I kind of pushed them away because they got into drugs and partying alot not really my kind of thing I lock myself away in my room playing video games and I love playing video games been doing it for most of my life it gives me a distraction from life and reality but my parents see it as a waste of time and been addicted the point I am at now is that I have no education, no drivers license and no future in life I have interest in anything to do for a job other than playing video games I really want to be successful and I have a vision, but I really don't know what to do and work is getting harder for me every week and I'm scared to tell my dad I want to leave my job because of my feelings I feel worthless and my time is running out everything I have written is not everything going on in my life there's a bit more about my work and other things and I'm not really good at explaining it sorry.

Hi everyone,
I have been suffering badly with depression for the past few months and can't seem to pull myself out of it. If I'm honest though I have been depressed since my teens, and quite badly for the past few years. I've had some traumatic things happen in my life that have led me to this point. At the age of 13 I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and have suffered with that all through my life up until this point, which hasn't been easy. I find that there is a general lack of understanding about my illness from people, including friends and family, with most not wanting to talk about such ""unpleasant"" things, which makes me feel ashamed, to downright hurtful things that people have said to me when angry, which has led me to believe that people who love you will only end up hurting you in the end. As such, I've largely isolated myself and shunned society. Ironically these are the people who then try and tell me that I should go out and socialize more.
In addition to this, a few years ago I suffered a major life-threatening brain bleed which has changed my outlook. You see, I have always had relatively good jobs, and have studied and worked hard to get where I am today. However they have always been quite high-pressure, and as such I find my health being compromised by work. For example, I have started a new job recently and have been working hard to gain a good reputation, however after working like a dog for the past few months, I have now flared and had to take time off. I hate this as now my health has been compromised but so has my job. Given everything that's happened, I feel that my two options are a) keep working and die at my desk or b) quit. However, I realistically know that I can't quit, and to be honest I really like my job, although not the pressure, so if I had to work it would be doing what I'm doing, I just hate the feeling that I can either choose my health or my job, not both. 
As such in extremely depressed at the moment and find myself bursting into tears at random times

My doctor has diagnosed me with depression. I originally went there because I wasn't sleeping, but somehow I let everything out to him and someone finally heard what I've been going through. 
From an outsiders perspective my life looks great but I've never felt so alone as I do now. Currently my partner is working away, every time we speak i cry or get mad at him for no reason. I sit in all day wishing I had friends texting me, needing me, wanting to see me. But I don't. I wish I could go and join a club or activity where I could meet new people but my anxiety stops me from doing anything. I just want a normal life but every day I am battling with my thoughts, getting anxious about things that don't even matter and thinking I am wasting my youth. I have recently had a lot of panic attacks too.  
Does anyone else here feel the same? I feel like the only person in the world right now.

Recently I wrote two articles that at the time I didn’t know they would be a sequel. “The snowball effect” was about how energy in a forum like this can gather strength and accelerate in its positivity. The second one was “Do we expect a smooth road in life” depicts our basic expectations of a life free of any mental illness.
 
We all have a journey whether we know it or not, recognise it or not. That journey, a road of twists and turns “Y” intersections or multiple intersections- can be a fragile one. One major slip in our decision making or an unsuspecting thump from a runaway vehicle (depression truck) and we fall flat on our faces.
 
Let me digress here. Kathy Watt Australia’s gold medallist in cycling was asked after her race how she won it. Her reply- “my coach told me to get to the front and just as I start to feel comfortable…add another 10% effort…then just as I relax a little…add another 10%. These 10% added effort you don’t think is there but it is. No one could catch me.”
 
We often refer to situations with our struggles as if we are on the bottom of our challenges and often we are. But there are days, hours, that we feel better. During these times, we are at an intersection, to the left is “go back to bed” and to the right is “don’t go back to bed”. We all know how hard that is but that snowball of recovery even short term recovery like a few hours wont happen if we take the easier route and turn left! By turning right we might- take the garbage out and during that short time you might realise how warm and inviting the sun is, meet the mail delivery person, see a daisy flower in bloom, realise your dog is staring at you for a walk lead in mouth…so that snowball has commenced all because you turned right..
As that snowball gathers momentum with each right turn your journey is no longer a plodding walk but turns into a brisk walk. You begin to get the feeling you are beating the black dog. If and when you think you are at this point then your choices are so important. 
There is a fighter inside us so much so some of us have never seen it. If those that think they haven't got a fighter inside them then what would you do if a dog bit you and held on? You'd find the fighter
So that choice in your journey comes when you approach that new intersection. Left is ""back 3 spaces"" and right is ""I'm going to fight like hell"". Turn right on recovery road and do your best..then keep adding 10%. The black dog wont catch you!...

I'm having trouble at the moment on a manic low, not sleeping well at nights and sleeping all day, racing thoughts, worried all the time about trivial things that I probably shouldn't. Not eating correctly, lost all interests in everything, keeping myself isolated from everyone. Friends call me and I make up excuses that I cant come out to socialize with them. I live with my two son's, one 28, the other 31, both wont talk to me because of some of the things I've said to them lately. The only thing that I get pleasure from is my little dog, which my son's hate. My day consists of getting up because my dog wants to go outside around 7.30am, I  take her outside so she can pee, then its back to bed till 1pm or 2ish, sometimes even later, then sit in front of the telly till dinner, when I open a can of baked beans then take it back to my own area away from the boys. Some times I think if I were dead, they wouldn't find out for days, I would never harm myself. If I call them on there mobiles to buy me something while there out they never pick up and make up excuses there phone isn't working. Looking forward to hearing from anyone that will talk to me...........

Hello everybody
I quit smoking just over 2 months ago and in honesty I did not find it as bad as I thought it would be.
But with each passing day my depression and anxiety is worsening. I have spoken to my Dr who naturally told me that this is normal.
I hate the way I am feeling but I just cannot pick up that first cigarette no matter how much I want to, I gave up due to the cost more so than my health. I had smoked for 46 years and was a very heavy smoker 35-50 per day.
I feel myself slipping further and further down that dark hole and having less and less interest in most aspects of my life. Everything has become an effort again.
I am retired due to a work injury so I do have long days, I read a lot,  well everyday,  that does help.
I push myself to tidy up the house etc, I don't watch TV but do listen to talk back radio.
I am in different groups on Facebook but don't spend a long time on there.
My only other thinking was whether to try the Electronic Cigarettes, but then I guess that would still be classed as an addiction , so I really am at a loss.
Hoping someone who has perhaps been in the same boat may be able to offer some good advice.
Thankyou

Hi,
Potato has nothing do with this, just an example of how I usually take something that affects me and attempt humor.
I don't know where to start. I think I've been suffering from depression since childhood, except I had no idea what it was till a few things hit me all at once. When I got to my teen years, my health suffered. I managed to get quite a bad chest infection, combine that with a life of asthma and it's slightly worse. Then shortly after that a skin infection (the infection comes and goes as it pleases).  Skipping a few things, (only because I can't think of their names right now). The biggest two contributions to my depression is the person who decided to cyber bully me in high school over 5 years ago. Never found out a name, which kind of left it brewing. An attack through a very popular site that anyone around the world could have seen. It doesn't faze me too much anymore though I still wish for a name. ( I know I'll never get that). 
The other contribution is my chronic headache. That more than anything I want a name to, well maybe a cure.  Now my chronic headache has been going for about 5-6 years strong, 24/7 7 days a week and not faltering once. This has been quite a hindrance to my life. Constant pain: Can't think too easily, can't absorb information, zone out often and I don't realize, I forget things (possibly because of the things I just wrote), I have suddenly found myself out and about (when seconds previous I was at home), can't get my licence because the previous things don't go well with me behind the wheel, can't get a job (I'd have to have a boss who was extremely understanding. Though with all that going on, why get a job). The person I'm supposed to be able to rely on is my mum. All siblings moved out, just me. She can't see it, so it's not there. She even said as much once. I understand its harder for those who can't see or think what it might be like. But the support I'm supposed to be getting from her I'm not. Damn sure she has depression too, though she loves her mask and is very much in denial about it. 
I've always questioned if I even own a brain, I guess this rant is some evidence something is there. There's more to say but my brain has used up it's energy writing this. That and I'm nearly out of characters.

One thing I've learned over the years managing my depression is to distinguish it from sadness. I'm in a bad place right now and I have every right to feel sad. However, because it is not inexplicable random depression I know why I feel sad and I know what to do in order to process the sadness. The most important thing for me right now is to not let this situation trigger another depressive episode.

Sorry I should be able to cope better than I am. I am overwhelmed when I am caring for my husband & need a break but then when he is out I just waste time & feel terrible. When I'm not productive or helping I'm worthless. I need to get a break so I can recover from fatigue but any break just allows the negative thoughts to take over so I feel worse. Most people here are much worse off than me so I shouldn't whinge. My councillor has been sick & so I have missed several planned sessions which hasn't helped

The hardest thing for me and trying to cope with depression is to not give myself a hard time for feeling this way; I believe at least half of my depression is due to my belief system and how I interpret things; even-so at times it's  really hard to be positive, when many of the important areas in your life are not going well; or not going how you would like them to go. I'm 59 yoa now and thinking back, I feel I've often tended to be quite serious and melancholy and sensitive; getting older comes with its own set of challenges; therefore I try to get plenty of sleep; nap during the day if I feel like it; eat healthy; hydrate, exercise; or at least move; get massages; especially for the physical contact factor; which is very important; especially if your not in a tactile relationship...the sense of touch is extremely important; find a good therapist and only keep people in your life that are worth your time....sometimes, trying to cover all of these points feels too hard; then I remember how much better I feel when I can accomplish even one of these things.
Talking about how I feel with my partner is also good; he's a good listener.

Hi  I'm new to the forum, but not depression unfortunately. I have suffered from it for many years, and struggle terribly with a complete lack of motivation. I used to be highly motivated and had a lot of self-discipline. Now I struggle to do anything really, and  I feel shame at the state of my house. To complicate matters I also suffer from hypersomnia. I have no immediate family, but my extended family are very old school, and very judgemental about my lack of housekeeping skills. Hence I tend to not have people around, which I know contributes to my isolation. Thank goodness for my fur-babies. I can really relate to the line in one of Robbie Williams' songs - something like ""I don't want to die, but I'm not keen on living either."" Any suggestions from anyone would be really appreciated. Thank you

 Sorry, this is quite long but I'm not sure what I need to do. 
I recently spoke to my maternal and child health nurse and she was concerned and suggested I my need to speak to someone in regards to my feelings. 
i have a 1 year old and for a little while now it seems to be getting harder to cope. My partner works 10 hour days 6:30 till 4:30-5:00ish every day. He then usually gets home and goes cycling for an hour or so when he finishes work most days. Which is all fine, but it leaves me home on my own quite often and I start to feel quite isolated. I don't have a lot of friends that aren't busy working and have other things on. I spend a lot of time just me and my baby.
 my problem is, that when I spoke to my partner about what the nurse said his response was kind of ""oh, that bad is it?"" And the way he said it kind of felt like he thought I was being silly/ had no real reason to feel the way I do. He likes to bring up how many other mothers are in the same position and they're coping fine, and though he never says it, it's like he's getting at 'so why aren't you fine' 
I feel okay when he's home but he doesn't seem to understand what it's like for me when I'm on my own all day. When he is home all he wants to do is 'just have a while to sit down and relax'. Most of the time he's home he does his own thing and only really helps with baby when I'm busy cleaning or cooking. He's very much of the mindset that 'I get paid to stay at home with baby and he gets paid to go to work' meaning he works and I have to look after baby 24/7. If I ever bring that up it just starts a big fight about me not appreciating that he goes to work all day and earns the money while I sit at home all day. 
All these little things build up and I start to feel like I'm not doing very well. And with his reaction to what the nurse said, he seems to think there's no reason for me to feel that way. So I doubt myself and think maybe I'm over reacting. I don't want to go and talk to someone because my partner makes me feel like I should be coping fine and shouldn't need to see anyone. He's never said that, but the first thing he said when I mentioned talking to someone was that 'I'll probably go there and they'll ask about him and I'll have to mention how he's always working and riding and doing whatever he wants'. And that's probably true, so he didn't seem at all keen for me to follow through. I feel like he doesn't believe I need help. 
 i don't know what to do!

Hello Anyone out there who cares to listen!
Ive hit rock bottom today and just need to connect with someone. Just writing this has made me stop crying, so thats a good start.
Im 57 yo and live alone which is probably why I feel the need to do this. Ive always been a loner, divorced 12 years ago and female. Work has always been a lifeline because I feel valued and its so busy you dont have time to scratch yourself!
But lately Ive had issues at work and in a nutshell, Ive been forced to move and I am uncertain as to where next. I feel Ive been unfairly treated and I am following due processes but its taking so long and meanwhile Ive been left out in the cold and feel like a pariah.
Just writing this has helped. Im lonely and have no one to talk to, which I know is my fault because I feel people are such hard work and Ive isolated myself, Thanks for listening.

Hi everyone, I am currently sitting on my bathroom floor feeling very lost and hopeless. I am 24 years old and have experienced depression since I was 16. I visited numerous psychologists and counsellors and finally about a year ago after experiencing panic attacks and felt I had enough of talking and my GP put me on medication.Over the last year I felt better than I had in years, however, over the last few weeks I have been waking up feeling sad and finding it difficult to get to work. I have had a family member in hospital and have been running around looking after everyone and have been feeling very exhausted so this might be playing a part. This morning I have called in sick to work, am feeling guilt, sad and I feel as though depression will be something I will battle my whole life and that it will continuously be something that will affect my daily life: feeling extremely negative and hopeless.

I feel sometimes like my life was and is like hitting my head against a brick wall and or a mice stuck running on the treadmill running very fast but getting knowhere. So these days i just take it more easy.
Maybe i am going through a mid life crises. Anyway i did average at school except for maths and when i did finish i had very little idea of what occupation to do so did a variety of jobs and was also unemployed for periods here and there.
When i new which direction to follow i studied degree finished and attempted new field but struggled with confidence, office politics and the working lies. It was stressful but challenging and partly enjoyable.
Anyway now i work in a different field which requires very little education, no challenges, sometimes keeping awake is the challenge and unless i do overtime we only just manage to keep our head above water financially. I am like that mouse going around and around but going knowhere.
My purpose to life is quit limited i try to look after and love my wife and son but most of the time when i get home from work i have very little energy left and am not a good listener anyway. I am living a very mediocre life. Thats not all but that will do for now.
Bye for now 
The Count

Well I have done the right thing again and it has bitten me hard this time! Been fighting this depression tooth and nail and I am still back sliding, and with this back sliding there is a HUGE amount of anger though I am not totally sure if the anger is aimed at me or at the cause of my depression sliding. You see a little over a year ago I got really stupid, my wife's nephew and his wife got kicked out of the place they were living, mostly for having to many animals and lieing about it, so after talking with the wife I told the kids (they are both 40..my age..but yet myself and wife call them the kids because that is how we see them as 4 yearolds on a good day!) that they could move in for a SHORT while, so they brought all their crap, and 4 dogs with them (so I now have 5 dogs on my properity and in my home) then we find out that the newphew's wife is end stage kidney failure, which does have some bareing on my situation, on top of them being kicked out of the place they were renting they owe the government a bit of money for defrauding the government and had a lot of other bills, which my wife and I payed most of their bills off..to date they have cost us over 45 grand easily, the nephew in law is an ungreatful SOB always whining and moaning about this or that and not even offering to do the dishes, heck they both have not even changed their bed sheets since they got here the wife and I (both of us being disabled) have to do it for them.  And of course the nephew's wife has a lot of problems but yet she is not ungreatful, where as the nephew realy is ungreatful. Anyways as they do not pay ANY bills (other then one of their own storeage bills) I want to charge them rent 400 a month, that ""rent"" money is actually away to get them a bond saved up as the nephew spends all his money (he is on the dole and has a part time ""job"" on stupid little toys(expensive ones) and what not, but my wife is not wanting to listen to me on the rent issue as ""they are family and no one understands the nephew like I do."" Doesn't not help that my wife is going though menopause and can be a real nasty piece of work to ME, everyone else she is very happy and friendly but as soon as something goes wrong I am the one she snaps at. I love her and put up with this because its not her fault some days, yet all of this is boiling inside me the depression is sinking in deeper and worse off this ANGER has a hold of me and once again. Never do the right thing it will bite you in the end!!!

Not sure where to start... Have been feeling down a lot for a long time now and my life has really gone downhill. Have only just been and talked to my gp and talked about things. Appointments have been made to talk about my issues mentally. Am looking for more help in the area of trying to get over the bad days or things or tricks that might make the bad days a bit easier.
My relationship is suffering big time and my partner is over having me be so down. Trying to fix me and the relationship is not going the best. Feel like I'm getting sucked into a black hole. Only on the bad days though. It hits me really fast as well, is that normal???
Thank you.

Hi everyone, i have been struggling with severe depression for 10 years now it is a struggle to just keep on going, Ive noticed because of this i don't have many friends, i have 1 left now but even then she's quite a selfish person and needy and doesn't understand and i notice its hard for me to make friends as i'm not the happy person that people want to hang around, has anyone else had this happen to them? I feel quite alone because i've watched my close family die around me for the last few years so now i have barely anyone, what keeps me going is my mum, my dog and my bf ( but sometimes he doesn't understand but he does try to help) Has anyone been through sort of the same and how do you overcome this? cheers

I have major depression and have just had a visit from one of my closest friends after avoiding everyone for some time.  She has started sending me messages every songle day asking if I have showered, if I have gone outside in the sun for at least 5 minutes because you know vitamin d is good, did I eat the dark choc she gave me, etc.  If I write back and say no but I made it out of bed into the lounge room and ate a piece of bread she still emphasises how good it would be to shower and go outside. I feel like someone should be throwing a party that I moved but it's not enough for her.  Don't get me wrong, I know it would be great to do those things but I just can't. I also know she is trying to show she cares but the end of the day when she is ""just checking in again"" I just feel annoyed and I can't help thinking she will end up annoyed with me. What can I say to her?

Hi I'm 25 years old, I have suffered from depression and mild ptsd. I am on medication and I'm going to cbt therapy. I live with my partner who is very supportive however I keep having dips, sometimes I'll be buzzing and be in an amazing mood and the next day I'll just dip. I feel empty and low, I don't speak and don't feel like I have anything to say anyway. My partner is picking up on this and tells me he feels sad and pushed out and asks if I still love him, I love him more then anything but I think in the back of my mind I'm doing it on purpose as I believe he can be so much happier with someone else rather then having to deal with me. I don't show him any affection and we haven't had sext in months which is down to me as I just can't deal with that at the moment. Any advice would be appreciated, I feel like everything is getting worse and I am struggling to cope! Thankyou

I was doing well for a while. After motivating sessions with psychologist & psychiatrist and life stresses easing somewhat I set some goals and started working towards them. I kept a daily record of how I was going with each of the different goals and this proved helpful by focusing on what I had achieved rather than what I hadn't done. I had a couple of bad nights sleep one due to my husband being unwell but still kept myself going. Unfortunately I remained tired and was unable to sleep in to catch up.  My problem now is that I am in the middle of a project at home which is taking longer than expected partly because pushing myself to work when tired has led to mistakes and inefficiency. 
I either push myself as I did last night and then when I stop I can't relax which then stops me sleeping creating ongoing problems or I give in and rest but then I keep noticing all the stuff needing doing so can't get the rest I needed. I have  had long term problems with pushing myself too hard and not caring for myself. If I am not being productive I feel worthless which makes my depression worse but fatigue is also a huge trigger for depression. This pushing myself has been a pattern since a traumatic event as a child which left me feeling guilty for doing nothing to help so feeling useless is a trigger for very negative self talk.
Does anyone else have problems balancing being motivated & productive & carrying out more relaxing activities / self care to remain well

Hi, I am new to this forum. I was diagnosed with severe depression 2 years and it has been an ongoing battle ever since. There is a lot of help out there for the young, males and elderly but very little for middle aged divorcees. My psychologist has cast me off in case I develop ""dependency"" which made me feel a fraud so I haven't been back to my doctor.

After 7 years without being on a medication, I'm in a state that I'm feeling pretty low.  I think everything has got the better of me.  I've been trying to fight it for a few months but I realized I can't continue on this path.  I've been feeling like something is wrong or is about to happen.  I've been worrying about my 14 year old son who last year has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and my 84 year old father has been suffering from depression and is about to go into surgery next week for his kidney to be removed.  I'm currently struggling to find permanent accommodation as well in the city that I moved to nine months ago as my flatmate decided to up and leave.  I feel like at best I'm existing, not actually living

I've had recurrent chronic depression and anxiety for most of my adult life and probably before that too.  It seems like a never ending roller coaster, only lessened a bit by the medication that I have taken for over 10 years.  In the last 5 years I have had a new job, relocated towns, divorced and a new relationship.  I have learnt to spot the warning signs of when I'm slipping, but its getting harder and harder to remain positive.  Just when I seem to be making progress another blow hits me out of left field.  I'm looking for hope that it will get better!

Hi there. I've got BPD, and I feel like a giant boiling pot of anger, depression and anxiety. I have seen some professionals recently, but they make me feel like a ping pong ball, as I never get to see someone more than once. I find it hurting more than helping and I can't gain trust, which I so desperately need. The only person that seems to understand things are my Live-in-boyfriend, but he is the sole earner in our household and if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have a roof over our heads. I try not to talk to him to much about my issues, or cry too much, as I don't want to stress him and affect his job, etc. I'm on a break from take at the moment, as I can't do it, I just can't.  The words swim before my eyes. But this is only for another three weeks, and I'm dreading going back. Lately I've been unable to answer the phone if my Mother rings, buy my shopping, tell someone I'm not okay, and I'm at a loss to how I can handle day to day things. I hate feeling so needy and weak, but I don't feel like I can do anything at all, I can't read or paint or play with my cats.  I noticed this morning I have a bedsore! I've been spending that much time in bed, doing nothing, I have a bedsore. I have other health issues that impact me, no gall bladder, arthritis, osteoporosis and asthma, so I generally feel weak, but that's physical, not emotional.  Everything is just weighing down so much. I'm so anxious I feel physically Ill, I almost puke if my Nanna rings, and I adore her,  and my Father. I don't know what's wrong and I'm lonely, and sad, and scared, and I feel like I've been trying to get help for so long and like I'm going no where, and I just don't know where to turn now.. I dont even care if no one reads this, I just had to say something,  somewhere.

Hi.
lately I have been feeling very depressed, down and basically just crap about all aspects in my life. I have thought about getting help for a long time now but haven't yet been able to get the courage to actually talk to someone so this is my start.
There's a few things in my life that I just can't let go to the point where I can no longer sleep at night and lay in bed for hours on end thinking about my problems..
i don't know what to do!
I let go and drove out the thing I loved most in my life about 6 months ago and can not stop thinking about her every single day, I think about why I did certain things, what I could of changed and dream of it getting it fixed but know that I will never get my relationship back. 
 I have also been made redundant 3months ago and haven't worked since so I've decided to work for myself. But in doing this I lay here in bed thinking I don't have what it takes to do this, I'm not good enough to be successful and I'm just bound to fail.
with all this time off I just think negative thoughts all day and all night and I know I need help but don't know what to do

I don't feel suicidal, but I really struggle with challenging negative thinking. I understand that I should not tell myself I am worthless, so I tried to change the sentence to ""I am valuable"" and for weeks I have been trying to find evidence that I myself believe. 
Am I asking the wrong question? Even when I think of something, I immediately feel like that is ok when I feel well but now there is not much value left in me? How did you get out of this? What did you change in your thinking to find answers? Any advise would be really good as I need to believe the answers I give myself.
I had a pretty messed up day, I got confused at work, got names mixed up and struggled to concentrate. I just feel flat. 
I eat and eat as if I am training for an ironman. I think my body thinks I am starving as I have no energy. I just hope I can sleep tonight.

The lead up to Xmas was awful, my depression was like thick concrete around my ankles and wet blankets on my shoulders. As soon xmas was over I went away for a few weeks to a friend's holiday house by the beach. There I could escape reality for a while. Back home and the concrete and blankets are back. School holidays are difficult, lack of structure does my head in. Motivation equals zero, but guilt equals 100 as I have kids. I wish there was a good time to crash and burn, spend a month in a clinic, but it's hard on the kids if I go away. I can't escape myself and my self deprecating thoughts. My psych is on holidays... Humph! So I feel a bit ""out to sea"" I can't see another one as I'm a year into Schema Therapy. I sound like a child having a whine, but every year at this time I get really sick. Just tired of the struggle.

I struggle with feelings of low self worth. I manage this by trying to help others and being productive. I try to finish the productive tasks on my to do list before relaxing. This was an effective way of motivating me to get things done which made me feel better and allowed me to relax after without feeling guilty. Because of several years of life stresses and depression this is no longer working. Feeling tired. depressed &/or stressed means I'm less effective & make mistakes leading little time for relaxing thus causing more fatigue etc. 
Things I used to enjoy are now too hard or are associated with bad experiences so it takes too much energy to make myself do things which I know will help. I avoid going out for diner, movies swimming. Holidays feel like a lot of work & I come home exhausted afterwards 
I was doing better but fatigue led to increased depression and wanting to give in

I cant work as i'm a chef & who wants to hire a chef who has fits,emotionally unstable & half the time physically ill? I get only the very basic help from the goverment they still want me to work even though i have been told not to drive & i live 30kms out of town. When i spoke to my GP at the start of the week i went in with a list of how i was feeling which is very un-me & left 10 mins later scratching my head,i dont think i would commit suicide but with how up & down my hormone & emotions have been i have been doing things completly out of character & struggling with my feeling & frustrations. I feel so alone,hopeless lost. I want to get in my car n run away. I have always faced my demons but holy moley dont know how anymore & losing the will to care about basic everyday life & my responsibilities which i am hating myself even more if thats even possible my GP seemed unconcerned with this. This is all too much for a first introduction sorry,just want the constant worry,sadness,anxiety,anger,fear to subside a bit i need to be back at work & being a happy & healthy roll model for my children. thanks for listening to me

I've read and heard other stories which are the same but it is hard not to feel alone. pressures of work and family build up. lately i feel i need to scream at boss or wife and say i'm done and just walk.i get treated like I'm stupid and don't know what I'm talking about. I've been doing my job for 18 yrs but yet i get 2nd guessed at every turn. even my own family practically disregards my input. my mind doesn't stop from these pressures. i feel invisible
I'm one to bottle up rather than confrontation even though my facade is the opposite. i feel i can't tell my family as my man hood and strength will be taken away. i thought i could push through this but the last 12 months its just got harder. i know i haven't got it the worst, the problem is talking, admitting and seeking advice/help. the confidence to talk face to face about it. even now i know what i want to write but its just not coming out..........
thanks for the whinging space

I have lived with depression for probably most of my life.  At school i had difficulties with bullying and social exclusion and these issues have seemed to follow me into adulthood employment and friendships.  Had an ex wife who treated me poorly during our marriage and then turned nasty when the gravy train ended.  Into my fifties, i have decided enough is enough.  I feel totally invisible to my social network - they either totally ignore me or only want to know me when there is some sort of gain or advantage for them. Or they only want to know me to tell me their problems because im a good listener.  But no one really knows how i feel or cares.   Around the time of my last birthday, i made the decision that i have had enough of feeling depressed because people treat me poorly and that im going to move interstate to try something new.  Things cant be any different where im going so i feel i may as well give it a try.  So sick of excuses of people being busy in their lives or they didnt mean not to include you in a group invite and not to take it personally.  So tired of employment rejection.  So tired of family members taking me for granted and only wanting to know me when they can get some sort of financial benefit.  So  bye everyone.  They say you shouldnt burn bridges but most bridges  start from opposite sides of the river and meet in the middle. No bridge is built in one direction all the time.  So not really burning any bridges. I have cut my ties with everyone - but no one has even really noticed.  Because no one actually gives a damn.  So bye bye farewell.  You wont have me around to punch like a punching bag any more.

And that's been me for the last 5 years. Tonight has been a little over 4 hours of crying. Mostly whilst sitting on my shower floor.
My story is a long one.More recently though the past year has finally caught up with me. 2015 , January I took my nephews to the safety of their nans house after their mother had lost her temper after numerous times and had the boys screaming and running for help. I got a phone call from one of my nephews who was 12 and begging for help. This night was a night i will never forget as i never knew the extent of the emotional and physical abuse occuring. What i did that night was for my nephews and their safety  what resulted was my whole family gunning for my blood.  I had turned on blood in their eyes and that was that. The following months would be consumed by their hatred towards me. The police even taking an avo out on my own mother because of her outburst towards me in public that would leave me so very shaken for months. Even to this day i am petrified to go anywhere incase i run into any of them. It felt like 40 of them against me. Vulgar threats and outbursts and public slandering has left me so hurt and broken but i fought everyday to hold my head high.  Family court decided that my nephews were better off with their dad. A decision i was happy with. This did not and still has not given me peace from them. The most heartbreaking thing was my pop. The one man i loved and cared for was turned against me and i have spent the last year worrying over his health and if i will ever get the chance to say i love you to him ever again. A long with this happening I also resigned from a mangers postion due to the fact i was shaking everytime I worked and was consumed with fear.
My boss at the time was not understanding and tried to demote me to eliminate my problem I guess.  The last tiny bit of confidence i had he took in one meeting that lasted 25mins max.
I have 4 boys who i need to remain strong for. They rarely see my tears or my struggle. 
 It has been 6 months since i quit. And i am 4 months into my counselling diploma. 
I am trying to remain strong. But tonight after finding out yet again someone is talking about me and needing to defend who i am.. i crumbled.... and this time hard
I am so scared of the overwhelming feeling to just give up. I don't know how to get the right help . I don't know where to even start. It is all just so overwhelming.am defeated. Exhausted and so very confused . And most of all scared.

Once in a blue moon I realise that I am real, feel real and feel alive and literally have a lot of free space in my head.
The last two times it lasted 10-15 minutes, depends how much I try to keep the feeling in my head. But after 15 minutes the feeling is almost completely invisible to me and I can barely remember how I felt in that period.
I experienced this scenario 3-4 times over 3 years. The first time was when I arrived home from an operation on my abdominal region, where I realised that I am depressed and worrying too much in life. I saw a physciatrist and was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, where I am currently still visiting and on prescribed SSRI.​
As anyone felt like this, and is this even a real feeling or am I cooked?

Hi all
After 2 years of being on the forums I have noticed several major things-
1) depression can affect anyone
2) however more often than not there is a trigger preceding it ie family, financial, work, health & other indicators
3) many people struggle with the diagnosis initially
4) some have a predisposition to depression
5) some have depression due to external factors, others may be genetically disposed, others may suffer seemingly ""out of nowhere"".
From my own humble understanding & making generalisations, it would appear most often that preceding events contribute greatly to depression. This includes grief, low confidence, high self expectations which cause us to feel badly about ourselves if we don't meet our expectations, life events & situations that distress us. Poor confidence, a tendency to isolate ourselves & guilt about accepting we have an illness all contribute to our poor self esteem. We are our own worst critics. We internalise our negative sense of self. We struggle with accepting our diagnosis-often thinking it is a negative reflection of our selves.
Thats just a few observations. In understanding & accepting ourselves others may have ideas.
After all we each battle to understand & live with our illness.
please add your thoughts.

If you had said to me a week ago I’d be posting this on public forum I would have laughed at you. Really I would have. On the ground type laughing. But here it is, the start of my journey to recovery. 
I’m a middle aged male, married, good kids, pets, educated, secure job, and house – on the surface living the middle class Australian dream. What on earth have I got to complain about right? Well, for years I had a sense of loathing that even extended to shaving in the shower as to avoid seeing my reflection in the mirror. 
 I had wondered ‘what if I wasn’t here?’ no one would really notice. Sure, my family would be devastated, but as everyone does when they lose a loved one they’ll move on, and life returns to normal...after the first anniversary I would just become a sad, distant memory.  
This despair escalated in late 2015 with work pressures ramping up. I was missing deadlines, yet excelling in managing some urgent situations so it was excused.  I had seen my GP a few times over the preceding months, and was desperate for him to ask me how I was going...On reflection, I probably would have lied anyway. 
I reached out to a psychologist under the guise of wanting to be a better person - she immediately saw through my well-rehearsed front. For the first time ever really, someone saw the real me. Saw the fatigue. Saw the deep sadness and pain that was my everyday life.  I eventually relayed most of the above, crying half the time in front of a woman I’d only minutes ago previously just met. She also convinced me to revisit my GP.
She made me promise to her that I stay safe. Why would she need to do that? 
My GP was shocked that I had held off seeking help for so long, and he quickly, firmly, and compassionately arrived at a diagnosis of depression. 
Again I was asked to stay safe – why do people keep saying that? 
 6-7 weeks on and it is still tough going. The medication has kicked in; am sleeping a lot better, am calmer. My breathing rate has decreased, and I don’t feel like I am in a constant state of ‘fight or flight’. Gave up caffeine cold turkey. 
I had a plan to keep all of this from my wife and friends. My psychologist was having none that nonsense. 
 So clearly trusting people was a big leap for me. But I have done it. I (now) understand it is ‘ok not to be ok’. I have an illness that for whatever reason chose me, and I won’t let it define or limit who I am.   
Oh, and by the way, I am indeed depressed.

Hi all,
I've been feeling so very down for a good few months and today i've had a momentary release - something so beautiful and I want to share that because you guys on this forum are really important to me. Tonight I came runner up in an art award, for a public artwork i made, and i'm so excited!!!! it is so empowering to have people acknowledge my ideas and my work. The piece was about a prominent female historical figure who overcame significant obstacles and opposition to excel in her field in what was a male-dominated profession at that time. It was also in support of marriage equality. And lastly is was about following one's passions and dreams - not waiting - and having the courage to do this. It was kind of a statement about me returning to uni to do visual art, and having the courage to pursue an occupation in the arts. But i guess what led me to post here is to share that even when everything feels bleak and hopeless, things can happen that light up our joy, even if they are only fleeting. And amazingly when I accepted the award I chose to make a little speech into the microphone (eek, first time!) and I radiated my joy and passion for art... in fact i wanted to keep talking but decided a few mins was enough... even though i am in the middle of a horrible depression episode and have no confidence in myself... it was truly remarkable! 
Kindness and joy to you all, Christina

Imagine you are in a room with 9 other strangers. All of you
have mental or emotional struggles of various types. You have all had different
lives with different backgrounds. You sit there wondering what to say. One person
begins to ramble on about nothing in particular…not making much sense hence no
replies are given.

One young woman begins to cry. She becomes visibly distraught
and at that point some of the others begin to comfort her. As she calms she
mentions why she got upset and others begin to reply ….the snowball of interaction has begun
to grow. The conversations extend to nearly all, some prefer to keep quiet but
they are at least- listening.

We’ve often mentioned in this forum the need to get the “mix”
right. The mix being proper diagnosis, the correct medications and the right
doses, a calmer environment, a more suitable career, better working hours, a shield against the cruel and toxic and
professional ongoing treatment. This forum could be said to be in that “mix”.
Why?

Because not only can some ask questions and get a reply
quickly but you are contributing to the gathering of this little community with
the same ambitions, to help each other find ways to cope.

I would suggest however, that your participation to give to
others comfort in few words with a reply is not only helping them….it is a
tonic for YOU. Since being on this forum I’ve found it an important part of my
own therapy. Giving to others in the form of referring to your own life’s
struggles, your childhood or your genes can be such a relief for those
searching for answers. By replying or even pressing that red button to say it
has helped you, adds to that snowball of support and you help it grow. You might not realise how significant a few words could be.

Today I read in a thread I started replies from two
contributors on this site, words of thankyou that my own words helped them in
their journeys. Its all part of that snowball and its tendency to grow when
others chip in. And that snowball helps you the thread starter as much as the person reading it. There is no difference to anyone here, we are all one snowball with our arms reaching out with open arm for others to jump in.
That my friends....is the snowball effect. For some, a vital addition to the ""mix"" required for a healthy mind.
You are reading this....welcome to the snowball. A world where your contribution however small adds to its ability to keep going.

I've been depressed lately and it's just frustrating. I've had illness and it's taken me 2yrs and it's taking so slow. I had to give up my job and now I need to find another job but I'm not sure what to do. With my age I'm afraid that I'm to old for somebody to take me on. I'm just upset as most of my so called friends don't call me or chat to me. Which is sad but what can I do. I think I let my partner down my family don't chat to me or ask how I'm doing which at time hurts. I'm thinking of moving to another city but with no employment or $$$$$ it's hard and frustrating. I get jealous of people as some have great life's and I wish I had there luck.

i'm not really sure what else to say, i just hate how difficult i find it to be myself around people, and how i always seems to put on this front of being all okay and superficial, i dunno, not really showing my true self. and that means i get so lonely not really connecting to people. i wish i could change this, its something I've done since i was a kid. it feels so lonely to not truly connect. if only animals were human and then i'd have no problems, i feel so safe in their presence :) Gosh this thing called life is difficult to understand at times.

I've been reading the various posts on BB forum and am gobsmacked at how so many of you keep on trying to get better. I'm currently going through my 3rd episode of major depression and anxiety, over a year now. This episode just came out of the blue and has hit so hard I  haven't been able to work for the past year. I'm on my 4th anti depressant and finally one seems to be helping. I don't spend the day crying on the couch. I can sometimes get out in the garden, sew, cook. But... I can't seem to do what I should to help myself get better.
I've tried 3 psychologists this time without finding one to assist. I know I should keep going but am so sick of telling my story I can't be bothered, I find it mortifying that I am this way, and that I always cry telling my story. I know I should stop binge eating sugary foods, but can't. I know I should exercise but I don't. I know I should join social groups (I live alone and have a few friends who aren't available often for socialising), but I don't. Also socially phobic.
How do you keep trying? How do you remain hopeful that it will get better? Although I have found a bit of peace, it doesn't feel real, like I'm just hiding or postponing the bad bits.

Hey guys this is the first time I have felt the need to seek external assistance as my issue keeps getting worse.
So for a couple of years I have been constantly been going through phases where I feel really lonely, upset and unhappy with my life. I am going through some issues at home but I guess nobody's life is perfect. The main problem that I am really confused about is my feelings of sadness and loneliness are completely disregarded by some close friends as they regard my lifestyle to be one they wish they could have. Not to sound arrogant at all but financially my family is doing well off, I have been offered my first preference into university and I have a good amount of friends always messaging me wanting to see me and talk to me. However, after all of this I always feel an empty spot and like to be alone and push out a lot of people in my life. I attempted to find escape routes to limit the loneliness I am going through but the happiness they provide is short and ends up making me feel worse. For example, I started smoking, starting going on a stupid spending spree, going out parties all the time but in the end I am always feeling the same feelings. Can anyone help me try to understand why I have these feelings and they come and go at various times during the week. I am sorry if this main be seen as a topic that is insignificant if so please tell me as this is my first time seeking out for help from random people. 
 Thank you so much in advance.

Allow me to begin by saying that, I'm not writing this to garner sympathy. In fact, the main reason why I'm writing this at all is because I unexpectedly stumbled across a spare few hours on a Sunday night, when I just happened to have a point in mind. It's certainly not the most dramatic or egregious of grievances, but perhaps it'll resonate with a few of you. So with no further ado:
 Stuff birthdays. Don't get me wrong, I like the concept in principle. Having one day out of the year when you get cake and people pamper you like a god is a nice little tradition, and it's a good excuse to have friends over and reconnect after being preoccupied with work the other 364 days of the year. It's a perfectly pleasant concept in theory. Where things begin to go a bit awry, is when expectations creep into the process. 
For some reason that I've never been able to understand, you're expected to be particularly happy about being alive on this ONE particular day of the year, like it's some spectacular achievement that should innately drive you to tears of happiness. Except it's not really much of an achievement, is it? Barring some truly poor decision making, it's not all that difficult to stay alive in the earlier decades of life when your body hasn't started ageing and falling to bits of its own accord. As a result, I've never particularly bothered with my birthday (particularly when it commemorates the beginning of a life that's been marred by depression for approximately half of its current lifespan), preferring to let it go unremarked and save my limited capacity for joy for times more deserving of celebrating. Yet, for one reason or another, people don't appear to be able to just let it go. They'll throw surprises, turning up unannounced proffering cakes, cards and candles expecting a WIDE grin and a tearful hug thanking them for the gifts and their thoughtfulness.
Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful. I'm gratified that my friends and my family care enough to spend their hard-earned cash, and even more valuable time celebrating the birth of a soul as prickly and curmudgeonly as myself. Were it possible for me to actually feel much of anything, I'd probably be touched. But what these silly buggers don't seem to realize, with your bright, expectant smiles, is that the closest thing I've felt to proper happiness in the past decade is the relief I felt relieving an overburdened bladder following 3 hours of Sunday Mass after having 2 litres of water beforehand.

 Just lately I've needed to know for sure.....is this life all there is?  What's ""out there?  After death..is there another realm, another spiritual place, other higher beings (those who've passed on or whatever) trying to communicate with us? What's there?  This can't be all there is...can it? 
I find myself watching for signs, symbols, messages, answers to requests & prayers....some kind of tangible ""thing"" to reassure me it's worth keeping on...trying,hoping, striving, improving, feeling, sharing, caring for my own health, listening to others, having fun, exploring other philosophies and beliefs - breathing in nature, delighting in pets - what comes after?  Is there any point to doing all of this stuff?  Why do such bad things happen to good people? 
How do we forgive ourselves....the more compassionate and loving we are, the more guilt we feel if loved ones are sad.......and we can't fix them!  How can we change into cold uncaring people...so that we, ourselves, hurt less? That way it wouldn't matter to us, if people we loved were suffering, would it?
Has anyone had ""proof"" of any kind of anything else existing? Any distinct messages from ""the other side""  ...is there one?....feeling scared and pointless today, sorry folks......x

Hi, im new to this, I had a little girl a little over a year ago and during my pregnancy i had a pretty rough time, was told we might need to terminate (but she turned out perfect) and then i lost my dad. My partner works away and I have no family support. Im finding things quite difficult as a first time mum, im feeling very alone, like no one cares, i have a very supporting a helpful fiance but still I am finding myself very unhappy and stressed and unhappy about life. My mum and I were very close before our little girl arrived and now I barely hear or have visits from her. Also, its hard to explain but i am still friends with my ex whom ive known for (20 years) and feel like ive had to slowly let go of our friendship (although i dont want to) but dont want it jeapordising things with my fiance (hes aware we are friends but although never says anything dont think hes too happy about it). My mum has also just divorced from my stepdad although I didnt like him so much because of something he did to me when i was younger i am now worried about how he is with my little sister and hes turned really strange and worry he will do to her what he did to me. I just feel i cant talk to anyone and i feel my whole family is falling apart and I am so alone

As I write this, its xmas morning. Last xmas morning I made a vow to myself....that by next xmas morning (today) I would have advanced with my depression and made a few improvements.
I would have-
1/ not thought at all in the twelve months...of suicide as a possibility. That that avenue, the idea of it, upon entering my thoughts, I would discount it
2/ That I would seek better stability of my medication. This was achieved by April by regular consultation with my doctor as to adjusting my mood stabilisers and anti depressants. This involved a little tweaking and was easier than I thought. I'm now as stable as I have ever been and likely ever will be. We need to allow for the fact that meds wont ever make us totally stable and we should seek the next best level.
3/ That on a personal level I would accept my wife more for her quirkiness and show more appreciation for her care and consideration.
4/ That I would seek more time aside for my time in a nearby forest. To take along my music I love (the pan flute) and play it. Meditate.
5/ That I would staunchly protect myself and my mental health by not allowing toxic people to enter my life nor allow some to re-enter it after previously being shut out. Torturing myself with troublemakers isn't going to help me.
6/ That I would remain on this forum. To try to connect with those needing my opinion in their struggle to get through life.
It's all worked. 
Merry xmas to you all and be positive for it is the only way to get through it all with the least pain.

Hi
I have come to the logical conclusion that nothing I do is worthwhile or meaningful.
I have not come this point lightly. I think though decisions and ideas carefully to make the most informed and well reasoned conclusions that I can. Unfortunately, emotionally, I am not happy with this conclusion, but I know it to be true.
It literally does not matter if I go to work or not. None of my other interests make me happy, anyone else happy, or have any impact on the world at all. My wife and kids are always upset and arguing no matter what I do or don't do. I have no significant friendships where we have an impact on each other's lives. I feel like I could disappear and no one would have the time or interest to care.
 I have tried a number of hobbies and pass times. The have travelled with my wife and alone. I have changed careers. I have moved locations. I have had an extended break from work to see if I could find answers. Nothing has worked.
I literally enjoy nothing and find reasons not to do everything. My nihilistic viewpoint has been reinforced and reconfirmed time and time again. The end point of every line of thought is that there is no point. I don't want to die, but I see no reason to live. 
 My first post to a forum like this, so wasn't sure what to write and what to expect.
 Why do you get up in the morning and why does it even matter?

I feel like I almost always have different points of view on things. I tell myself that other people don't understand where I'm coming from, that they're being overly harsh on me because they have their own issues, or that they're biased or whatever, but it gets so tiring having a different point of view from everyone else. Just for a while I'd like to agree with others to know what it feels like to belong. But that would be wrong. I shouldn't have to do that. My opinion isn't wrong it's just different.

hi all. after just over 12 months, i am no closer to happiness. in a nutshell,  i am 47 years old, separated with a 3 yo child, and no regular income. i am in financial difficulty, trying to pay a mortgage and keep a stable home for my son who i have every weekend. i can not put closure on my separation, as my wife can give me no reason for leaving except that she was unhappy. i gave her space, as i believe she was suffering from post natal depression ( she also has been diagnosed with bipolar). she started to go out with girlfriends on weekends and i stayed home to take care of my son. we both could not afford to go out, as my son did not sleep through the night until he was 2. she would then sleep all day after late nights. nights out became more regular, and with groups of old ravers. leading into old habits. she went overseas for 2 weeks to a rave festival in belgium whilst i took time off to care for my son. when she came back, i overheard a conversation she had with a friend that she was planning to leave. in the end, she continued to party with groups of people and told me she wished i was more like some of these people, especially one bloke. she confessed to taking drugs consistently and wanting an open relationship. this led me to depression, medication and a regular physcologist visit. i said to her that she needed to make a choice, and she left the next day. i continually question myself, and of late have quizzed her for answers. all i get is that she is finding herself and the error of her ways through a fellowship group. i am lost, overwhelmed and riding the roller coaster of depression. i need closure, but can not get it. the hardest part is that i still love her, but have chosen not to take her back as financial settlement has been finalised and i could not go through this again. i am in a very lonely place even though i have support of a few close friends and family, who i am slowly pulling away from. i know that i can only find the answer to happiness and a more positive outlook, but i am just looking for an outlet. hopefully this is it.

Hi I am so lost and lonely very depressed don't even know where to start

i feel so miserable worthless I live with my ex partner due to can't live alone and have no where else to go don't get me wrong they are great and I am very lucky to have them to help me as I don't know where ll be without them. The thing is when they leave for work I am crying as I don't wanna be left alone so scared and end up crying most of day as I am right now.  I have been sick had a operation which is giving me pain and high lated the anxiety which does not help. I do see a dr but honestly not much has been done to help me. I did try some tablets but they made me sick as most things do. Which is why I am so scared about taking anything. I get so angers at myself for feeling like this. I was once a strong person who could do anything go anywhere now I can't even go outside my gate. The only time I leave the house is to go dr which makes me so uptight and very nervous. I don't drive so I have to ask my ex partner to take me to drs I know it drives them crazy but I don't have any other her help.  I just don't no what to do anymore I am at rock bottom and need some help !!

Hello to any people that read this....
I was wondering if anyone else can relate to what is happening to me.
 I have been a member on BB for a couple of months. During this time a have read a lot of other people posts, like what is happening to them, and how they feel. And sometimes my heart hurts after I read their words. Often times I cry about the pain they have felt, because I can't stand the thought of anyone else hurting or in pain in any way.
 They are all strangers to me, yet they are not at the same time. All I want to do is give them hugs. True some of the feelings they have are no stranger to me, because I have felt them. But the person is..... And I do feel a little connection to some people.
But mostly this is all I can do, just cry,give hugs and tell little stories. And sometimes I feel useless, because I cannot offer advice or something. I even feel a bit dumb, because everyone else seems to give advice, but I am unable, because I don't know what advice to give. And I wouldn't want to give the wrong advice anyway. I don't seem to operate much from the head, just emotions and feelings.
I do care very much about every single person that I read about. 
Can anyone relate at all? And now all I want to do his give each of you a hug to thankyou for giving your time to me in reading my words.
So here is my hug and with all my heart I say thank you.
Shelley xx

Hi folks.  ive recently been given the news that my disability support pension will be terminated and I have roughly a month to lodge an appeal.  i was diagnosed with major depression, agoraphobia, panic attacks and OCD. I was diagnosed back around 2009 and been managing with medication when needed.  three years ago I moved from one side of town to another (I'm from Canberra) and the support services on this side of town are horrendous. I've been disconnected from my old support services so I have no recent mental health history other than my local gp's review and prescriptions. ive become highly stressed as of October with new neighbours moving in next door fighting day and night resulting in me losing sleep which thus fuels my anxiety severely.Ive also had threatening notes stating that someone will kill my dogs and my neighbour attempted to assault me on xmas day/Boxing Day when police arrived due to noise disturbance. I rarely have panic attacks and maybe use medication once every six months. Lately I've been taking it weekly with panic attacks beginning to creep up on me.  when Centrelink called me to tell me they have terminated my dsp and will be switching me to Newstart I was completely devastated and didn't sleep for 48 hours and didn't leave the house for 4 days. Right now I am requesting my medical history from the government mental health teams that used to work with me and that alone can take a month. I am struggling to re-engage with support services since I'm in a grey area of being functional enough to carry out daily activities like cooking and cleaning. I believe if I didn't have my medication daily and my dogs to help me I wouldn't be able to leave the house at all just like in 2009 and bordering on the suicidal.  any help would be greatly appreciated

I thought I would type this as the link to my HI all so I can explain.
I loved and enjoyed my holiday back home in NZ and it was great seeing family and my sister, gave her a big hug and we cried and a positive outcome is she might come here to Australia for a holiday in December.
How I am feeling now thou is my head is just lost completely lost. I know I have goals set for this year and maybe it is just that I am impatient to start on them with psychologist appointment and my nursing course but deeper down inside I am feeling really irritable, frustrated, unsure of it all or of anything with my goals maybe it is the thought of failing.
I want to succeed, I want to bring in money to support my husband and I as we are looking to buy our own home, I want financial income for my daughter with her needs, I want a job! a career! I want to feel normal! i'm sick of feeling like worthless and useless no one will want to hire me, take me on! I'm sick of not knowing exactly what is wrong with me and sick of taking these medications trying to bring my mind and life in balance.
I'm forgetting things too. I don't eat meat not that I'm vegetarian but it clogs my system. Yesterday my husband was telling his dad how I had a sausage roll, I said no that was in NZ and he said no Carol that was only yesterday you had it.
While I was away in NZ I was forgetting things my daughter spoke to me about from the day before.
Last night I did a online Bipolar test and it showed I have it, I then showed it to my husband and he is like (ignore it you don't know where it is from) just listen to your doctor. Don't know why I did the test but I am thinking maybe the doctor missed something.
Well I want to know what is wrong with me, the score wasn't high but it was there.
I'm fed up with myself and all of this. I'm getting frustrated easily, snappy, short tempered and easily feeling irritated towards my husband and myself. I don't know how to explain it all properly and clearly everything just feels mixed up and muddled and confusing right now.
Well I will go, made myself a list for things todo today so will try and concur that while shame to same on second drink and it is 7.45am. Who to turn to but my Bundy and you all on BB.
Durras
XO

I feel so lost that I'm not sure I'll ever feel happiness again.  Every single day is filled with tears and a conscious effort to try and act happy, normal and like I fit in this world.  I have things to be happy for....beautiful children, a roof over my head, food.  Yet my constant thoughts are of hiding away and never facing anyone again.  No one understands and I am so fearful that my children will see my constant sadness and be affected by it.  I try so incredibly hard to be happy for them but I am so exhausted.  There are no answers, no quick fixes to anything.   I long for when I'm asleep so that I can escape the hurt for even a moment.  I'm not sure I even want a reply.  Sometimes just writing things down eases the confusion in my head.

I have suffered depression since I was a teenager & it took many years to realize that I had was depression, possibly even bipolar. I've been diagnosed with severe depression & am on an extremely high dose of medication.  Yes it has helped somewhat but I still have a lot of depressive episodes. I've tried counseling for many years,  read books etc but still suffer with those depressive moments. I have fantastic days where I'might on top of the world but then in the blink of an eye hit rock bottom.  My depression has stopped me from fulfilling every goal that I have ever had. It is so debilitating. I have raised 5 children & now they're all grown up I just feel like I have nothing left to do on this earth. I feel utterly alone. My husband & I split nearly 20 years ago and now I just feel completely alone & useless to anybody.  I don't believe my depression will ever get any better as I have tried all the positive thinking & it just hasn't worked. I have tried sharing my feelings with my children & some friends but I always come away feeling like none of them really care. I just don't know what to do.  I don't feel that I will ever be be free of it. It's like I have this nasty little demonervous sitting on my shoulders weighing me down & stopping me from achieving any of the dreams that I have ever wanted. I just cannot shake it. I just don't know what to do.  It's no good being told to just stay positive because it doesn't work.  I've tried all that. I honestly feel like I'm a totally useless human being and am just a total waste of space. I'very tried so many things over the years that I just don't believe that anything will help me at all & I will be like this for the rest of my life. I just don't think I could cope with living like that for another 30 or 40 years. It'seems unbearable enough now. Now that all my kids are grown up & have families of their own, I feel completely alone in the world.  I have no husband,  no children at home & hardly ever get invited anywhere.  I'mean so lonely & believe that no one on this earth truly cares enough about me to make sure that I'm ok.  I hate the way my life is.

I have tried writing an introduction now for a good 10 minutes,  but every time I write something,  I delete it.  How do you introduce yourself to a world of strangers?  How do you type what you feel and what you think?  How do you know that people won't judge you or think something of you?  That's the thing,  you don't!  This is my life, these are my everyday struggles. 
I am 27 years old and I have been struggling with anxiety and depression all my adult life and more then likely childhood, which is probably where it stems from.  I have been to psychiatrists and made some progress, but,  it only lasts for a while and then I revert right back to the same thing as before.  
I have reached the severe depression obstacle and overcome some of the struggles,  sleeping all the time,  not wanting to get out of bed.  Shutting everyone out,  hiding from the world. But I fear it is settling in again and sometimes I have no control over it. Somedays it is easier to give in then fight it.  
My anxiety and I are not the best of friends,  a few years ago,  I couldn't go into a shopping centre by myself,  I couldn't talk to anyone by myself,  I had no life,  and no where to turn,  I sat in fear of my own fear.  
No body understands what it is like to face the day when they have never suffered from depression or anxiety, people will only assume what they think or believe but for some one who battles to just get through the day, we understand each other and we understand everything.  
I am new to this whole forum thing, I hope to share my stories,  advice and my survival tips with you some day and I look forward to hearing about yours.

I am 28 years old, I am a single mother who is studying
nursing full time at uni (1.5 years to go). I lost my job before Christmas due
to funding cuts and I am at the point where I have been selling things to buy
food. I cannot apply for part time work because I am always on and off working
at the hospital for my work placement. My availability is always up and down.
My family don’t support me and I am constantly having to beg for help from
people to just drop my son off to school so I can get to the hospital on time. I
have a knee injury which prevents me from doing a lot of exercise so now I just
‘walk’ because I can’t afford to see a physiotherapist. 

I have depression (lack of exercise further contributes to
this). Walking takes up a lot of what precious little time I have though so it’s
not the most practical.  I have been
brought up in a dysfunctional family where my parents were junkies and I was
physically, sexually and emotionally abused. I am always trying to make my life
simpler and less stressful (I eat healthy and look after myself and my sleep
habits) but there is always shit that comes up and knocks me down again. I have
made an appointment to see a psych, I have had one session so far which is
organised through uni.  I am really tired
of ‘fighting’ to get somewhere in life. I am just so sick of always struggling
and trying to be strong.

Hi everyone, I'm new to this forum and have always wanted to post something about my own struggles. I've just recently, on the advice of the only friend I spoken to about depression, gone and seen my GP about the way I've been feeling for the last 3 years. I've always been that person that everyone likes, but have not ever been fortunate enough to be seen as someone who another may be attracted to. I'm sure there are people in worse positions than me, I'm physically healthy, employed, have a loving extended family and I'm lucky enough to have been living in a beautiful tropical town for the past 12 years. To be 33 and having never had a  girlfriend, makes me so sad I can't explain it. It never used to bother me, I know I'm well liked/respected in the community and I figured it would work out for me. To have never had someone care for me in that way, to have missed out on so many moments tears me up to the point where I just can't function when I'm alone with my thoughts. I know that to find a partner I need to be happy in myself and more confidant, but it's so hard. It sounds so selfish to me, but I would just love to have someone genuinely happy to see me, or to know that someone is just waiting for their work day to finish so they can rush over to be with me. I have so much love to give, but I'm afraid that I'll never be able to share it with anyone. As beautiful as my home is, it's transient nature is hurting me so badly. Watching friends pair up and leave all the time is constantly leaving me trying to chase new friends, and every year I fit in less and less as the new batch of people in town are always that few years younger. While I know I have to take risks, I'm worried that if I moved to the city, I'll just be another dull face in the crowd, at the very least here at home I'm well known. I think what makes me really upset at the moment is that the only person I've poured my heart out to about my feelings is also leaving in a few months, I'm not sure what to do then. I guess at the moment I'm just hoping the meds my doc put me on will help me feel well so I can at least get back to feeling happy, even if meeting a partner is not something that will happen. All I know is I can't cry myself to sleep anymore, I just hate the way I feel, and its taking all my effort to not hate myself.
Thanks for reading, I really appreciate it.

It's been quite a while since I posted.
My husband has Acute leukaemia at 43 & had a bone marrow transplant. Who knows what his future will be-the uncertainty is really hard.
I was involved with the Royal Commission & am pursuing a civil case against a priest who abused me when I was a teenager. 
I also thought my 16yr old daughter was coping amazing & was so proud of her. My 11yr old son hasn't coped well & is very hard to reach. He just wants his dad all the time he won't engage with me unless it's anger.
i just found out by accidently seeing notes my daughter had written that she's not coping as I thought. She has immense underlying anxiety & anger towards me for the impact of my depression on her life. I feel I have 2 children who I have hurt so deeply with the symptoms of my illness. It crushes my heart. How can I make it better? How can I fix the damage I've caused? They needed me so much with their dad being sick. And I thought I was there for them but I obviously wasn't. 
I've tried to talk to my daughter about this & apologise but her response is always ""I don't want to talk about this mum because I end up feeling guilty for being upset with you & nothing ever changes"".I really fear them getting older & their main memories being of me depressed, letting them down & being over medicated. This is a reality. My illness has defined me as their mother. They are the main memories they have of me. And if I suggest taking them out they won't come & say "" mum you never keep your promises so I'm not going to get excited, I don't have any expectations that you will do what you say"". This is understandable as I have been sick more than a few times when I've promised to do things with them.
im so low today. So full of self hate. So sad that they are drifting away from me. I don't know that this is something I can make right. I'm trying so so hard to communicate with them & suggest doing things together but they have lost interest.
i had a abusive upbringing. I know the damage & scars it left on me. Now I'm leaving different scars on my children. They are my world. I cannot put into words how deep my love is. It's breaking my heart & creating more depression now that I know how deeply my illness has affected them. 
All I want in the world is my children's trust in me & to stop their love being overshadowed by my PTSD, depression &?anxiety.
I feel so so sad & worthless & unhappy.

I am so sensitive that my feelings get hurt so easily and that sets me into a pattern of thinking (you are so stupid, no wonder noone likes you, I don't know why people want to be friends with me, I should just disappear).
The smallest triggers set me into a downward spiral.
I was feeling great the last few days as I decided on which course I want to study in uni and applied.
My best friend made a reply to a Facebook comment I made, he was joking around but it made me feel stupid.
Sometimes the comments I leave I do not realise others see as silly, I do not meant to comes across like a fool, it makes me think I am a fool.

In my head last night I kept saying to myself ""he's only joking"" ""he's doing what close guy friends do and give each other s**t"" ""my gosh you are so sensitive"" ""you know he loves and cares about you as he has told you numerous times"",
but my emotions are of hating myself for appearing to be so stupid for the sometimes inane, pointless comments I leave on Facebook and kind of angry at my friend for making me feel stupid by pointing that out to me a number of times. I am aware he was joking around and that his reply in no way is meant to hurt me and shouldn't hurt me but it's like my emotions make me hate myself and get angry at him and want to disappear from any online presence.
My friend has told me that is what is so endearing about me, my dagginess and some of the things I say sometimes which sound silly. But I feel unintelligent. Sometimes my mouth moves faster than my mind and I say dumb things.

I can't understand why I react like this to something so trivial and harmless.
I know there is no need to feel this way and try to get myself together but some force inside of me pulls me down and washes over me.
I was feeling upbeat and positive about my future (going back to uni if I get accepted and hopefully into the career I want) and now I feel like I have no hope and don't feel motivated to do anything and am filled with a sadness.

Anyone here react like I do?
I wish I wasn't so easily hurt and had thick skin.
I wish I could make things bounce off me instead of setting off my depressed mood and negative thinking and self loathing.
My medication is not working at all, it should prevent this reaction from me.

Does anyone else have significant problems with their cognition as part of their depression? I am finding at present my mood is reasonably stable but i am unmotivated, lethargic and my brain is Slooow. It's like I cant string sentences together in my head. I have to read everything twice or three times before I can retain it. I am normally a very sharp, very logical and quick thinker. And it seems the harder I try to make myself focus and think more clearly the worse it is. I am on Newstart and supposed to be applying for 20 jobs a fortnight. What do I do when I can hardly get my brain into gear to manage the basics? I do not think i could hold down a job in my chosen profession at present and am reluctant to take anything on in case I cant manage it. I registered with an agency for locum work and did not declare my history of depression under health issues. I really don't know what to do.Has anyone found any of the medications helpful with cognition?

Hi
im struggling with my two children (daughter 16, son 11) who constantly put me down, criticism me & call me names such as a ""druggie"" who is ""off my face"". They are referring to my antidepressant medication which makes me very tired by about 8pm.
its been a roller coaster the last 12 months with my husband having a bone marrow transplant as the only hope to treat his leukaemia.
Then I'm involved with the Royal Commission & a civil case against a priest who abused me as a teenager.
i love my children more than anything but I'm so hurt they are drifting away from me. My daughter who I've always been close to now doesn't ever want to be at home & is angry at me.
my son just wants his dad all the time & refuses to do anything with me. He is the most sensitive beautiful child & everyone comments on how lovely he is yet behind closed doors he only communicates with me aggressively if he wants something.
its breaking my heart. I've asked my husband to have a talk with them & explain depression & anxiety. But he won't-he says we all need to talk as a family which yes it would be ideal in different circumstances. But I don't think they'll say how they really feel if I'm in the conversation. They need to have space to talk openly without feeling restrained by my presence.
i understand they resent the times I havnt been able to disguise my symptoms, the times I've cried, the nights I've fallen asleep early due to exhaustion. I'm terrified they will grow into adults & only remember the symptoms they have seen me battle. 
I grew up in a very abusive family & from the time my children were born I was devoted to raising them to be confident & able to express themselves. I wanted to give them all I could & I even started sending them for things like massage from when they were very young. I even gave up working because they wanted me there for them after school like other mums. I've instilled in them that no matter what situation they may face in life I will always love & protect them & never judge them. An example is recently my daughter drank alcohol for the first time & was very sick. I just went & got her, held her, made her food & gave her lots of water & told her I'd always be there for her. I also talked about the effects of alcohol & the dangers of losing control. I never shame or embarras her. I treat her with unconditional love.
But I'm losing them as they resent my depression symptoms.it breaks my heart. 
Depression is so cruel.

In just after 2 weeks I will be returning to work after being in hospital for three weeks for a breakdown, sleep deprivation and diagnosed with Bipolar II. I have been off of work since later November and I have been doing everything I can to move forward with my recovery. Medication, daily exercise, monitoring my diet, using a psychologist and relaxation techniques. 
My downfall occured after I was assaulted at work (I work in a prison) and shortly after things started to spiral downhill very quickly. Even though I believe the assault contributed to my being hospitalized, it has not been the complete reason why I had my breakdown. I have been suffering with Bipolar for years and had always tried to fight it but finally it got hold of me and I couldn't cope any longer. 
I thought I was ok to return to work but today I had a discussion with a Mental Health professional and when I pictured myself back in the workplace, I really panicked. Tears came out of my face and I had no control over myself, it was like it became reality. Like I said, I have always been trying to keep everything together and returning to work is no exception but I am really really concerned about going back and it's only just come to the surface. I know the working environment I am in is not ideal for my mental health but I am now worried that returning may trigger me and I lose it again. 
We discussed changing jobs but even the thought of that right now is to much to handle. I feel like my back is against a wall. I have been financially upset by my time off and the return is going to help with the finances however I am not sure how I am going to cope in the working environment. Any ideas/suggestions/thoughts would be really helpful at this time.

We know from our forum that there are a good percentage of people newly diagnosed with  mental illness  that seek a cure for their condition. Regularly we try to educate them by saying good management of their condition is a preferable approach rather than a 100% fix. I mention this because if we admit to our ambition of good management then we resign to the fact that we will never have a full recovery. That being said does that mean we will never find true happiness? Will we always reflect upon not getting to full recovery and so never really be happy? I'm asking this here today because I have finally found happiness yet still have my down and up days depending on my mania/moods. I'm happy even though I'm fragile emotionally and I'm happy besides the fact that humans upset me regularly. Why is this so and could there be tip I can give you?
Briefly- I have bipolar 2, dysthymia, depression and previously had anxiety with panic attacks. I'm on mood stabilisers and a small amount of anti depressants, fish oil. Physical issues include sleep apnea and deep vein thrombosis. My wife has depression. Unlike me she sleeps a lot when the black dog visits.
My road to recovery- well inside my mind is a positive ""never give up"" person that changed from being negative in 1983 after attending a motivation lecture. I cant begin to tell you what good effect that had on me. It planted the seed to the fighter in me now. Then a major down time prior to my marriage split in 1996. Clearly leaving my then abusive and ungrateful wife was the best move I ever made. So if you have big doubts follow your heart if all else fails. Don't hang around a doomed relationship. I began to write poetry in 1994 unaware it was good therapy. Writing anything down helps. And these changes-
-A move to the countryside (if this interests you then try it. I advise a very small town within 15 minutes of a larger town the latter with hospital, gym, supermarket and schools.
-I got rid of all toxic problem people
-met kind people
-limited social media
-Hobbies
-get lots of sleep
-Staying away from club committees/politics
-spiritual contentment
Self help is good. 
Happiness can be claimed when you have more good days than bad, when you act on your needs, when you are well enough to help others, when you've accepted your illness as part of YOU and when you are stable enough to come across as not having a mental illness.
My goal is reached...what about you?

I cherish the time spent with family. Everything else is a composite for a warm life.
 I am alone. I exist in pain. This path leads further inside.
 Time passes, and I reflect solemnly on all that is lost with each passing moment.
 I never wanted to be here, but I've been too scared to stray. And it is self fulfilling - the feared turned inevitable.
 Where's the light? Where's my hope? What hasn't crumbled in my fingers when clutched to the chest?
I'm a fool.

Hi,
I'm new here and new to depression  I was diagnosed last October after the first gp I visited simply told me exercise was the best anti depressant as she handed me a tissue and showed me the door.
Once I was properly diagnosed I was put on meds and after two weeks I began feeling 'normal' again. 
Everything has been going great until this week. I returned to work after a wonderful holiday with my family. 
Working for a small company in an admin/sales role I found myself alone this week as all the other employees were away and my depression returned. 
I haven't skipped a dose of my meds but I felt how I did when it all began. Crying at my desk and watching the clock. 
I removed myself from social media and my social life as well. A few close friends have tried to reach out but I just want to be left alone?
My gp is on leave so I'm just reaching out here. Is it possible the isolation has triggered my relapse?
I have been looking for new employment but it's very hard when I'm struggling just to get out of bed each day.
Thanks for listening!

Hi All
New to BB. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years. Tonight is a particularly bad night. As I look back I am counting the cost of what my depression has bought me. My marriage broke down 5 years ago as my ex-wife was unable to cope with living with a miserable man. She gave me a lot of support over the 10 years we were together but in the end it was too much for her. My 16 year old daughter also struggles with my condition and I am seeing less and less of her as she grows up (which is breaking my heart). I have been unemployed for 4 years and am on a disability pension. I once had a good career with a decent salary and now I struggle to make ends meet. I am living in a small unit on my own and am very lonely. Many of my friends have drifted away , either unable to comprehend mental illness or sick of my unreliability ( I never know when a bout of depression will leave me unable to attend an event until the last minute). My parents have been wonderful support to me but they are now in their eighties and neither are well which worries me greatly. Basically I am sick of my life and I suppose I am feeling a bit sorry for myself tonight but I just needed to express myself. Thanks for listening

Hi
Over the past few years i have suffered with depression on and off. Sometimes its not so bad and i have the motivation to do things that distract me. Sometimes so bad (like at the moment) that i can barely get off the couch except to go to the cupboard or the fridge to have a binge.
Because of the binge eating i have gained a large amount of weight. 
At present my mood is so low and my eating is out of control it is putting a real strain on my marriage. 
Dont get me wrong he would support me in anything i did to get help (which i attempted once a while ago) but he has also said things like he no longer finds me attractive because of my weight gain and that he still loves me but not as much because of the person that i have become.
I want to get help but I'm afraid of taking the first step and am not exactly keen to go on long term medication either.
Any advice is appreciated

I am the happiest I have ever been and I have a great deal to be happy about. I live in comfort with most amazing woman who is, without doubt, the love of my life. I have everything yet quite suddenly I am miserable, lethargic and frightened. In the dark moment, I hate myself and my eternal failure, I see my hopes, my efforts and my happiness as examples of my self delusion as I mark time until the moment of death.
I have suffered from depression and social anxiety since childhood, ""he's a shy boy"". I've been taken to, sent to and gone to the doctor more times than I can remember, with little to show for it. For many years I sought refuge in alcohol to the point where it almost killed me and continue to live with the physical consequences of that. During those years professional medicine (UK) offered a choice between drinking and treatment for depression, I could not have both and I chose to drink although, on reflection, there was really no choice, I was physically dependent. Somewhere in The Last Chance Saloon I found an organisation called Turning Point and in 2010, with their help, I went through a medically supervised detox, my third. I believe that in getting and staying dry I created the conditions in which I could get well and my life could become better, no guarantees but a fighting chance and I have been one of the lucky ones, sobriety has given me everything or almost everything. In recovery, I have met and married the most wonderful woman, we have each helped the other through dark time and enjoyed good ones together and continue to do so. 
Without alcohol and with the help and support of ""my angel"" I have been able to manage my fears and depression much better but they both still exist and right now they are biting hard. Since arriving in Australia I have found a little niche within my new society but lately that niche has become less secure and my confidence has taken a knock. I am self employed and my work is physically demanding, I love that and it is part both of my recovery and my identity but in the busy run up to Christmas I overdid the whole thing and became ill. My reaction to physical illness has been predictable, but only in hindsight: ""I can't do all of it so I can't do any of it, I am a failure, I am useless, my life is a house of cards and it's about to fall apart"". Well I can't do it all but as to the rest: I can, I'm not, I'm not it isn't and it won't.
This post is a gathering of thoughts, yours gratefully accepted.

Hi,
I have PTSD. I'm getting better but I notice a severe lack of motivation.
I've had about a week and a half off work and I just never want to do anything. I'm not engaged with life. There's a whole beautiful world for me to enjoy but I just resolutely, stubbornly, WON'T. I just waste day after day lying around, sitting and reading, whatever. 
Whenever I get an idea to do something I have a crushing resolution that there is no point.
And yet I'm bored and hate myself for never doing anything, being so unimaginative, being so boring, not making the most of life. 
How have you overcome that lack of vitality, fear of doing anything, conviction that there is no point in doing anything, resistance to fully living?
What is it truly about, do you think? Where does it come from? What's the underlying belief? 
I've spent, like, a decade sitting around preferring to think and analyze, than to do.

Hi everyone,
 
this is is my first post and it has taken me so long to work up the courage to make it. A bit of my background; about 3 months ago I had a complete meltdown halfway through a semester at uni. I couldn't function anymore, i didn't eat for about 4 days and I was scared of everything. I couldn't switch off after handing in assessments, I quit uni and my part time job and moved back to my hometown, after 2 years of living away from my boyfriend of 5 years, and family because of uni. I saw a GP who said I was suffering from severe depression and anxiety and referred me to a psychologist who I began seeing straight away.
my psychologist has called it an adjustment disorder with depression and anxiety symptoms, and said it usually lasts about 6 months after the stressor is eliminated. I think my stressor was a combination of living away and the stress of trying to manage uni and a job and living in a place where I don't know anyone. My GP suggested taking antidepressants but I'm so scared, so I haven't got any yet. 
I'm writing this post because I really thought I was improving from regularly seeing my psychologist and being closer to my boyfriend and family. But all of a sudden I feel as if I have taken 10 steps backwards and I'm almost back to where I was 3 months ago. My boyfriend has been my absolute rock through all of this but over the past 3 months I'm constantly questioning our relationship and my feelings towards him. I don't want my feelings to change at all because I just love him so much but I feel like I don't know how to be in a relationship anymore. I don't have any reason to think that we shouldn't be together and I just want to know if anyone else feels this way with depression? I'm constantly pushing him away, but I don't want to be alone. He told me it's starting to get hard for him, and that he feels he has to walk on eggshells around me because he doesn't know what mood I will be in when he gets home from work. That completely tore me apart. but he's so positive and knows that we will get through this. When I start crying he cuddles me and says it will get better. I can't wait for that day.
Sorry for the long post and it probably doesn't make much sense, I just blurted everything out at once. i just can't handle my emotions being on such a roller coaster. I really don't know what to do :(

Hi Everyone, 
I am new to this forum. Am up late as don't want to go to sleep as am worried that my councillor session I booked for tomorrow morning will not bring the results I feel I need. I have a very good life but over the last 3 years I have had some traumatic things happen. My life seems to be a constant stream of ups and downs. More downs than ups. No matter what I do I am just existing.Not living.. Today was a bad day. I have noticed I have been struggling for a while but today was the day that broke the camels back. My mother is in hospital and I am all she has. I take on a lot of responsibility and feel really helpless that I cannot fix her and I have to see her suffer. I have been getting sick very often and have been feeling under the weather the last two weeks. I struggled at work this morning, a job I used to love, and I then got a call about my mum. The last time I had a loved in a hospital they died. Something just snapped in me. I couldn't stop crying. I rang my husband and I rang my aunty and I asked her to come with me as I had to be strong for my mum but I honestly didn't feel I could do it alone. My husband is really wonderful. I called him and he was just there for me. We have been through a bit together. It has changed us but also brought us together. I feel he is also struggling. I try to talk to him and he sometimes opens up. When I picked up my Aunty I broke down even further. I couldnt stop crying and I just kept telling her how I felt etc. I felt guilty for asking her to come with me. I got extremely lost on the way to the hospital. I cannot focus or concentrate much. Find myself zoning out very quickly. Cancelled the rest of my day and after making sure mum was ok I came home. Fell asleep on the couch.. ate something.. then hubby came home. The rest of the night was good minus how I feel. I already take something for anxiety. I remember going to the doctor years ago and said I felt unwell. He said nothing was wrong and gave me a prescription. Now everytime I go to the doctor I think it is all in my head. I have put off going to the doctor too at times because of this. I am also a very good actress so I am worried that I will walk into the councillor tomorrow and be perfectly fine. I AM NOT FINE! Anyway.I just needed to say that I had an absolutely awful day and have had an awful time at late. I do tend to isolate myself.. and everything is taking a lot more effort.Thank you for listening to my rant. Any replies would be great.

Hi all,I want to say first of thank you to everyone for all support given to me, all your words of advice and support are so much appreciated and I know it isn't easy when your struggling in your own battles with life.Not feeling suicidal, but yes feeling like I have had enough of being this way. Woke this morning feeling so gloomy, heavy chested, head still going like a runaway train with thoughts and can't stop it. I just want to stop it all and thinking this is how my life is suppose to be, this is it.I have put much positivity into posts for others to help but I guess like it can be so often, it is easier to give advice and support then taking it for yourself and harder to practice what your preach.Don't really know what else to say but just had enough of being this way and can't see my way out of it. Have had goals, woke the other morning feeling positive but now it has gone and think I was only dreaming or wishfully thinking but na it won't happen.Feeling guilty for not being a better person, wife,  mother and feel have nothing to offer anymore and can't see it in the future also.Am going to doctors today hope he may help, but that's just it also, hate relying on meds to make me feel normal, to me it's not normal. (sorry so much negativity going on in me right now, hope that don't hurt anyone as I know meds are a positive helper but right now feeling negative about them and having to rely and depend on them.Well had enough of living this way.Durrasbeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Who me? No way. Just because I'm old and grumpy and oversensitive and get annoyed by 90% of the population 90% of the time, doesn't classify me as angry, does it?  (smiley, smiley)
My problem, as I'm sure it was for a lot of you, is that I didn't deal with my own anger when I was young. ""Anger"" was seen as an emotion that could only be expressed by parents or older siblings, those in authority. Boundaries? We never heard of that word in the sixtees and seventies. Ok maybe for cricket, I admit. 
It didn't seem appropriate or cool for me to express annoyance, so I never did.
So now I'm making up for lost time. just get angry for fun now. For nothing so I can stay in practice, in form.
I heard that anger and depression are like twin brothers though. I need to work on some of my anger, mostly caused by rumination. The past seems to really influence my current happiness. I wish I could just focus on the present .

My beautiful mum died in 2008. A couple of years before that I told her I had depression and had been in a psych ward, she listened and tried to understand me, then said something to the affect..... but you're not .. ONE  OF THEM ... are you ?? (shock horror) I stretched out my arms and said.... yes mum, I AM, ""one of them"". Poor darling I don't think she knew what to do or say. :-) But she and dad became very supportive. However I only ever let them visit me in a psych ward once, and that was after a very bad situation, when I had to stay in bed in the hospital for over a week. But when they visited it was just like a normal hospital visit .... sort of, well that's what it would have seemed to them anyway.
Just off that note, I'd like to say that I was originally diagnosed (25 or so years ago) with having ""severe depression"" then about 18 mths ago I was told I had bipolar....then...last year I hear there is... bipolar one, and bipolar two....which I didn't know about before. I learn something every day.....

Hi, everything seemed to be going ok in my life until the last couple of months. I have lived a coped with anxiety for the last 7 years. Life events seem to be hard to get through. Our first child was born in July this year and even though I was anxious I found a way to get through it. Since then things have taken a nose dive. His arrival caused the usual tension in families and I fell into an argument with the in laws which I have never argued with. Two weeks later my family is turn apart when we all find out that our step father had forced himself onto our disabled sister and made her pregnant. Next day my work load doubles as I decided to take on an extra project. I coped with it all and I couldn't work out why I wasn't feeling anxious. Then it all fell apart when we decided to move house. Insomnia was the start of me crashing. Nights of no sleep drove my mind to suicidal thoughts and finally thoughts of harming my wife and son. It was then I cried out for help and ended up staying 3 weeks in a psychiatric ward. They diagnosed me with a type 2 bipolar disorder which made sense to me. I now take a antidepressant a mood stabilizer . It has been two weeks since leaving the comfort of hospital. Nothing makes sense to me a simple everyday tasks are a nightmare. My wife keeps reassuring me that things will get better. Two days ago the closest family member that I held to my heart (my grandmother) past away. I so confused I don't know if I am grieving or ignoring the fact of loosing her. I feel a peace one minute then anger and sadness the next. I don't want to get out of bed yet I do. I'm constantly stuck in making a decision and not making one. I want to have a goal to head towards but I constantly add a negative thought to it. I'm lost in darkness and fear yet I seem to enjoy the attention it brings to my negativity. Banging my head against a brick wall won't help as nothing seems to fix this up and down roller coaster ride. Has anyone lived through a similar experience or suffers with bipolar and depression and has some idea of what the way out looks like? Any help is good help!

In the new year I had five days of non depression, not happy or euphoric but in a stable state of mind. That's the longest I've gone without sinking in eight years, but I've slipped back into my usual state of mind in the last few days. How do you deal with the disapointment when you relapse? 
I'm trying to get my life back together but I can't seem to trust myself to achieve my goals

I now feel useless as my husband hasn't been sick since I stopped work except very minor things. I haven't been able to do much because my ankle is still too sore. I end up in lots of pain if I walk much. I feel like I will never get decent work again and if I did it would be a disaster as my husband may get sick again. I feel like I can no longer do things I enjoy. Even when my ankle heals bushwalking is no longer fun because my husband is blind so I have to watch him and guide him on any interesting walks where the ground is rocky and uneven. I used to enjoy ballroom dancing but cant dance properly any more I wanted my husband to have lessons so he could dance better but now there is no point. We used to swim but I don't like swimming in the sun as I am scared of getting burnt and I have to watch my husband all the time as  he can't see where he is in the water. We used to enjoy camping and driving holidays exploring places and then going for walks. Now I get tired of doing everything myself'the packing setting up camp, packing up camp, driving, navigating, planning where to go so it takes so much effort I can't be bothered but then feel guilty as my husband wants to do it. I feel like I shouldn't complain because other people are much worse off eg a friend's husband had a stroke and her daughter has down's syndrome and her son is autistic so I should be grateful and cope better than I am. I have good children who are all adults but I don't want to be a burden on them. I have lists of things which need doing but haven't done them. I should be doing things instead of complaining.I feel better when I have done something useful which I am no longer doing. I also feel fat and ugly.

Crying because others are hurting. When I read your post, I recalled many years ago when I completed uni and commenced employment in welfare. Several of my colleges were chatting and one beautiful soul explained what lead her to this employment. Explaining how her daughter had been brutally murdered by her partner. I folded. Being a young mum I couldn't think of a deeper pain. This was the making or breaking point in my career. I was of the firm belief I could never be competent in employment with the burden of another's anguish. Then this is what she shared with me. Which I have always believed in and lent upon. This helped me through when I could not speak.
 Often in life we are confronted with the reality that we can't fix, cure, prove or win. However despite this we can still care, share and 'be there' for each other. 
Interestingly it is the caring, sharing and understanding that provide the friendships
And fulfillment that give life quality. 
 
Sometimes when we can't fix, cure prove or win we feel like withdrawing from a 
Situation or a relationship because we feel helpless or vulnerable. I have found 
That if you just 'hang in there' and take the challenge of 'being there' and 'riding the wave together' the results are amazing, even if it is 'a rough ride'.
If we know that someone wants to understand and care and that we are not alone, we can relax and free ourselves from fear and frustration.
 
Once a good friend came to me crying over the death of her mother, in my desire 
To fix her, I said ""Don't cry"" to which she responded ""Wendell, I have to"". I was 
Grateful for her honesty, that let me cry as well. Now I get relief from being able to share and care... A closeness and understanding that is more precious than a magical solution.
 
The resource of knowing I can be honest, even if it is tears or silence that express it, 
Produces a strength of friendship that is greater than the fear that I must be strong or 
Have all the answers when reality tells me that is not being honest anyway.
Anyway being friends is the best part of life.

I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 18. So I've had 7 years to come to terms with it. If anything it was a relief because it explained why I felt the way I did. I'm on medication and it's under a decent amount of control. Doesn't mean I don't have low days. But it is much easier to manage.
I have now been with my partner for 7 months. He is a great guy, very kind, caring and loving. I think it's time I tell him that I have depression. Not so he can help me or change something. Just so he knows. It can also describe why I have sexual arousal issues to him so he knows it's not that I don't find him attractive. I'm not really worried about how he will react because if he doesn't accept it he's not the one for me. But I don't know how to tell him. Any tips? 
Thanks

Hi, I'm new here so hello. I guess I'll just get into what I'm feeling. For a while now I've just been getting through day by day. I feel like I have a massive hole missing from me and that emptiness and loneliness that comes with it is hard. I have a lot of friends around me so I'm not technically alone and when I'm with people I'm a social butterfly. How is it I can be separate people? I also over think things all the time and make the smallest things huge but the big things I don't tend to worry about. And I worry about what people think of me all the time. Recently I have got worse because I split with my boyfriend, the relationship was pretty toxic so I know that has lead me to feel even worse. I don't know how to switch off my brain! And I'm originally from the UK so I don't have family here. I'm going to see a doctor this week but I don't know if I want to take antidepressants or not and therapy I have tried before didn't work. I'm just very lost. Any comments would be helpful.

Hi, 
I'm new here and I wanted to reply to  thread instead of posting a new one, but I didn't want to spill my problems on someone else's post, because I didn't think that would help them...
Actually, that's my life in a sentence, I never want to be a burden on anyone or put myself in people's lives (does that make sense ?).  I have been sad for a long time now, I'd say over a year, probably close to 2 years now.  I don't know why I started feeling like that.  I've always been shy and I can't say that I have had a close friend for a long time.  I'm not the type that has had a best friend since school.  I seem to always get left behind, people move on and I'm not sure why.  Maybe I'm 'too hard' to be friends with....  I honestly don't think that though because I'm sure everyone who knows me would say that I'm lovely, funny, loyal etc.
When I say I haven't been happy for a long time, I honestly mean that.  I sometimes just want to sit and cry, but I have kids and a husband, and I just think to myself that I need to wait until I'm alone to have my cry.  I know I need to go to the doctors but I don't even have a trusted doctor, and how do you start that conversation ??  I told my husband the other day that I couldn't remember the last time I felt happy, and I cried to him, but he has obviously dismissed it.  I have tried dropping hints to my mum but my dad has suffered depression for years (although he's fine on medication), and I don't want to burden her.  And to be honest I think she would just think 'oh no, not another one !'
I'm happy when I'm at work, and I have friends there but they are work friends, not friends I socialise with outside of work. It's when I'm at home that I feel the most lonely.  My kids are great and my husband is too.  
We've had a lot of stress with my husband's work situation this year, many ups and mainly downs, hopefully he's on the right track now and we can get settled with that part of life, but at the moment it's adding to my stress, and financial worries.  
I'm always stressed and worried and sad.  Any advice - where do I turn ?

Not seeing an end to ones struggle with depression is most frustrating and confusing thing about this state of mind. Picture this: you've had a few things go wrong in your life. A build up of normal things that everyone deals with happened to come at once; a break up with someone you still love, losing a job you loved, having to move back to your parents place which leaves you feeling like you've gone backwards in life, being screwed with by people you care about and trust. None of these are the direct cause of your depression but all were part of the catalyst. You feel weak because you can't deal with problems almost everyone faces at some point. You visit some friends to try to regain some normality, they all know your down so they try to ""help"" by telling you about people with much bigger problems than yours, this just makes you feel worse and weaker for not being able to cope with your now marginalised issues. On a good day you can still enjoy th work you're passionate about but on a bad day you can't even get through that without thinking ""why do I suck so much at this?"" your mindset is so negative your actually driving yourself to perform worse at the main thing that brought you joy in the past. You try pretending for a while, smile and talk to people as if nothing is wrong but inside your blank, you have no good feelings towards anything and after a while you become sick of lying to yourself trying to pretend like things are ok, pretending that you can get through this. You feel like crying (and sometimes do) at random points throughout the day seemingly for no reason, with no trigger, just because thats how you feel constantly. You have absolutely no drive to live, you've established some kind of work routine to at least not loose all your ability due to this spell of depression but you know it's not enough and you know it's not working. You question whether your just reinforcing bad work habits trying to work on anything in this mindset. Everyone in your world knows what your going through but no one knows what to do or say and they can't do anything to help you, they might try but they say the stupidest stuff that just makes you feel worse. ""you need to get a thicker skin"" ""your overreacting, everything's fine"" ""Stop being so emotional"" ""Just think obout how other people have bigger problems"". The worst thing about depression is that you know your the only one that can fix this problem but you don't know where to start.

I know bad things happen to good people. I just wonder why it seems to happen, so much to me. I wonder if somehow I attract bad luck to me. It's not even a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I've convinced myself, I'm one of God's favourites. Because there are givers & takers in life. This is not good or bad. Just the balance of things like black & white, yin & yang. The givers seem to suffer so much more hardship than the takers. I say God is training me in the trials of life to help others. Because as we all know when your a giver, no matter how bad your feeling, when you see some one fallen down or just miserable or struggling in general. We'll stop & put our hand out. Let me share & help ease your burden. So God trains us up in life's hardship to give us skills to assist others & this keep humanity going. Givers learn how to catch the curve balls, how to roll with the punches, how to throw that mask on at a moments notice & smile just to lift another's day, When inside your dying & don't know how you can travel on another day. I say God I'm tired. I've learned enough please let me rest for just a bit. But still the curve balls keep coming. With every punch I've dragged myself back up and plodded on to another day. My mask is dusty and cracked. So I'm running out of platitudes & wondering why my life has to be this way. I have become silent in my grief, I wonder will people believe me if I speak of the last curve ball that just came hurtling through? My 17 yr old son say why does God hate us? Suppose this is the difference between boys and girls. My 15yr old daughter says our life is like a Maladrama or some horror movie, she states I never tell anyone at school about what happens at home, I couldn't stand it if they didn't believe me or even worse felt pity for me. Do you think people can be contributing to their own bad luck? I'm sure if I stand on the freeway at peak hour and get stuck, I'd probably have to take some responsibility. But I rarely get to leave my home. I hardly have contact with society, friends or family only the kids & me trapped at home. How does this keep happening. When does it end. What am I doing to keep having sh*t piled on me?

I'm in remission from depression/anxiety which was diagnosed January 2014 so two years on and recently I've been feeling sad and confused. Could I be relapsing already? Currently on appropriate medication for treatment which has been very successful. Anyone else experienced these feelings? Thank you.

Hi all,
 I've had severe depression and anxiety for 3 1/2 years now.  In 2 weeks, I will not have left the house for 2 years and for the year prior it was 4 times for doctors appointments.
The problem I have is that I have been supporting myself financially throughout all of this time.  Not having an income for 3 1/2 years with the usual outgoings is crippling me.  I've made adjustments in my life to ensure to cut down on any waste of money.  I want to apply for some sort of social support/welfare but I am in a catch 22 position.  My anxiety is such that I just won't leave home and I dread the thought of having to jump through hoops, so much so, that I have been willing to just support myself financially for the sake of my savings.  Well, over the past year the constant attack on my savings is not helping with my anxiety levels at all.  I am not tackling thoughts of eventually running out of money and where it puts my future.
 Has anyone had this problem?  Does centrelink cater for us socially phobic people who just can't bring themselves to go to the required meetings to ""jump through hoops"".  I am sure I am not the only one in this position.
 Any advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated.
Bj

I don't suffer clinical depression but I am certainly capable of depressing thoughts. Pessimistic thoughts. Negative thoughts. ""Scotchfinger, why are you such a drag?""Well not all the time.So here is my most depressing thought of late.""What's the point. We're all gonna die one day anyway.""I just lose all motivation when I hear myself think that thought.

So. Where to even begin. My extremely small circle of friends is getting sick of it all I am sure.... Of course they don't say so to my face, but they hang around with me less and when I try to tell them how I am feeling alone, they say not much at all.
It all started with my marriage break-up, I couldn't cope with how I hurt my ex so I cut him off completely and moved interstate. Away from all my family, ""friends"", my dog and every single thing I owned. The ""friends"" part was hurtful in itself as immediately after we announced our separation they cut me off and wanted nothing to do with me... None of them kept in contact when I moved. Instead they spread rumours about me amongst themselves, making me feel worthless.
So, I move, on my own. For the first time ever in my life I am alone... I am always lonely, I am sad, depressed, anxious and angry with myself for making this all happen. I am also angry with my ex - why didn't he help me? I asked for his help before I left (already being diagnosed with anxiety and depression) and he 'let' me go. He was supposed to be there for me!
I'm away from everyone who cares about me without judgement, although I'm not close with my family at all - which makes that 'nothing' feeling very real; if my own family don't care why would anyone else? Why would I? Why would my ex? Why would my friends? I feel like I am absolutely alone in this world now and I am barely keeping my head above water. 
Trying to make new friends is near impossible; I have joined numerous Meetup groups and I make no connections. I have tried to join social groups to the same avail. I also now have a new partner who is great, but he doesn't understand why I cry for no reason at any time of the day. He just goes quiet which frustrates me SO much and I then get angry. I also don't see a long term future with him; which also ads to my sadness. I can't bring myself to end things with him because I'm not strong enough. As I write this I feel I sound so incredibly selfish and stupid. I'm sorry, please don't judge me, I cannot help how I feel. 
I see a psychologist and have done for years now, I'm not interested in meds, and I don't feel I am progressing anymore with my psych. I will organise to see a new one and hope this makes a difference. Every minute of my day feels like panic, I feel like I don't belong anywhere and haven't for at least 3 years. How do I get that feeling back? I don't want to feel this way anymore. I'm exhausted.

Hello. 
I am almost 30 (this month) and have PSTD, generalised anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. 
 I have been in a long term relationship which has been unhealthy for both parties and not much of a relationship to be honest. I only just started seeking professional treatment about 6 months ago when I had a massive breakdown and had to be admitted to a psyciatric hospital. While my partner has said he still loves me, he has made it clear the behaviours we had before cannot continue as it was not fair or healthy and he will not stand for it anylonger. I understand this and agree but it increases anxiety to worry about falling back into the rut and also clearly identifying what is and what is not acceptable as his communication skills arent that great.
I spent 4 months in a psyciatric clinic stabalising, and after discharge, I went to live at my parents as i was too much for my partner to care for while working full time.
I have been recovering slowly from the last breakdown and then had to move house. A huge change as its quite far from my family (35km vs 1km, house vs apartment) and my partner is overseas for another month. I managed the move successfully by myself through all the bumps that were thrown at me, but I have only been able to sleep there a few nights. Over the past weeks i have had daily panic attacks and they are now so bad, i have regressed to the point where i cant manage on my own. I can barely eat and i have ulcers in my mouth and stomach. I cant sleep, i cant relax. I have come back to my parents but im not sure is this the best thing for me... should i stay here or should I go back to the psyciatric hospital? I know i need to learn more independence and my partner thinks my parents 'baby' me but i also think this is helpful because its less artificial than the hospital environment and when i improve i have the ability to do things for myself whereas in the hospital i have to wait till im discharged to be able to 'practice' things like cooking for myself and cleaning for myself. In addition to this, i can have my two dogs at my parents who really comfort me and i cant have them at the hospital.
i am wondering what other peoples opinions are on this... am i better off with my parents or back in hospital?

Hi everyone, I’ve just joined up to this
forum because I’m feeling pretty alone with my depression lately. I’m in this
weird place where I’ve done a fair bit of therapy and growth stuff over the
last few years and have better skills in coping with distress and keeping
active and talking about how I feel and looking after myself physically etc BUT
at the same time I just seem to be getting sadder and sadder and in a way more
and more isolated from meaningful connections with people. So despite all my
new skills I feel further away from living and joy and life. Can anyone relate?
I’m in my mid 30s and am scared that my depression will just keep getting worse
no matter what I do. I used to have so much enthusiasm for trying to heal, but
this year I’m trying to accept I might have a life-long mental illness. But how
can I help the downward slide from getting worse...? Its like the treatments
affect the superficial parts of my depression, but at my core it doesn’t budge
:(

How do you keep going, when it feels like everything is failing. How do you keep getting out of bed every single morning, when there is no point to it. I have read a thousand times that happiness and fulfillment are choices, and yet I have not chosen this life. It seems to have chosen me. I work myself into the ground, days filled with busyness, rude customers and other people's problems, just so I can spend as little time as possible at home with my own mind. When I crave sleep, I can't get it. But when I do get it, it is so broken and plagued that I don't want it. I have an incredibly talented and supportive professional team behind me, and I recognize how lucky I am in that. But I am honestly at a stage where I feel so darkly alone, and I don’t think things can get better. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Has anyone else with
dysthymia ever thought that the description of it being a less severe
depression doesn’t seem correct? I keep thinking it must be comparable to
holding up a light weight. No problem right? But the longer you hold it up the
more it feels heavier and the more your body aches. After holding it for as
long as you have without being able to put it down for a rest, it eventually becomes
unbearable.
What do you think?

I feel guilty because I am wasting time and not doing anything useful. I feel like I have no purpose. I feel guilty because I have no excuse for complaining Other people have much worse situations. I normally am very goal orientated and feel bad if I am not achieving things. I am marking time waiting for summer to finish. I hate the heat. I am scared in case fires start and I don't like going out in case I get sunburnt. I had a good job which I left in October. I had been struggling because my husband kept getting sick. He spent 6 weeks in hospital Sept-Oct '14 just after I started work and came home so weak he could barely walk from one room to the next. (we previously enjoyed bushwalking) He then had lots of doctors appointments and tests to plan for further surgery to prevent him having the same problem. I was very stressed and always worried about him. I couldn't afford to take off much time for carers leave because I hadn't worked long enough. My plan was to arrange a holiday and see how I felt after having a break. Unfortunately one holiday was cancelled because of the initial illness, the second holiday (which was timed to coincide with a public holiday and flexing my hours to limit the days off) I came home exhausted as my husband became sick the night we left and I got very little sleep as I had to look after him in the night. After his surgery in July we booked a 2 week holiday for September. The surgery failed and was repeated 5 times. After the last failure we decided not to contact the hospital or doctor as we couldn't cope with another failed attempt. We will just manage as best as we can. 2 weeks before the holiday I broke my ankle so the holiday was cancelled. At that point I decided to resign rather than see how I felt after a break.

Hi,
My thoughts are all over the place at the moment due to how flat and depressed I feel about the new year, well it's really the whole Festive period in general, which also contains my birthday smack bang in the middle, so needless to say it's a pretty stressful and depressive time. 
So New Year's Eve came and went, I'd been feeling particularly down all day, withdrawn and just generally feeling worthless. No one had asked me to go out or do anything with them and I'm not overly fond of my own company because I'm not the biggest fan of myself and I'm generally by myself the majority of the time. long story short, I spent the evening watching tv, midnight came and went, about 10 minutes after midnight, I felt an incredible sadness hit me like a bus, as if the disappointments, frustrations and depression from the past 12 months had finally caught up with me. I'm worried that I'm now going to carry this feeling into 2016 and this year will turn out as badly as last year did for me mentally. I've been taken off my AD's mid last year as they weren't really working, I was still attending psychologist appointments, which were helping.
Any advice anyone can offer up on how to beat this thinking would be greatly appreciated

Hello All,
I am currently doing CBT and starting psycho therapy next month and one of the returning thoughts that keeps bothering me to a great deal, is my ability to maintain friendships and relationships. I actually used to be very good in keeping up friendships & acquaintances and I used to blog, send post cards, letters and emails, call and see the ones that were close enough. My relationships (friends, family, acquaintances) are literally scattered all over the world, mainly Europe and Africa and now also in Australia. I have moved many times. 
For the last few years I found it more and more difficult to keep in touch with people and I started to doubt the intend of people and their actual feelings for me. Where I used to be very giving and forgiving, I am now very reserved and suspicious and bitter. I have again and again thinned out my contact list, created and deleted blogs & facebook & other social media accounts again and again and I am just wondering if I am the only one who gets so confused, who does not want to be in touch, who just does not know. And I am also wondering why this bothers me so much and I think I am so stupid, as it is as if a rich person worries about what to do with all the money. I feel so ungrateful and just stupid. 
I'm just wondering if this is part of depression and PTSD and if it will eventually get better and I will eventually feel something again that does not confuse me.
Thanks, Yggy x

Hey,
im having a really hard time. I feel like I make some progress and then we just go back to the beginning again. Things shouldn't be this hard. Hating how things are at the moment. Finding it so hard to be positive about anything. 
Sorry but needed to offload. Need some space to rethink how I move forward. Feel like I'm running into a brick wall over and over again.

Hi everyone,
I am new here. This year has been beyond awful for my family. My 8yr old son developed severe OCD (likely linked to Autism- doing assessments now). Me being so driven believed I could 'fix' everything for him by immersing myself in all the info on OCD and taking him to his Psychologist- following all the rules to successfully beat OCD. I put everything I had into helping him only to feel like a complete failure when we had to resort to medication even though I am fully aware of the role serotonin takes in mental illness- I am not against medication- I was just upset that I did not achieve my goal unaided. I realise medication was necessary in my sons case- he had began to believe everyone and everything were poisonous, life in general was torture for him. Question to everyone... Does anyone else put such high and un-achievable expectations on yourself that when they are not reached you fall into a depression? I have noticed a pattern of this throughout my life, has anyone found a way to stop it happening? At the time I never feel like what I am expecting from myself was out of reach- it is only once my depression lifts that I truely realise how misguided I was.

Hello,I'm a 29 year old mother of 2 and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I've been on an antidepressant now for a few months and have been doing yoga and reading a lot of self help books.but I go through stages where I feel great for a few weeks then its like I hit a wall and am back to square one all over again! It can take me a few weeks to pick myself up again and it's just driving me insane going through the constant up and down.i don't have a very supportive husband or huge support system so I do feel alone a lot. Has anyone else experienced the ups and down whilst on meds and trying the other things? I was seeing a physiologist but stopped after feeling embarrassed that 2 mothers from school were working in the reception area i hope someone can relate xo

Hello everyone, I feel like I am starting to feel waves of depression, anxiety and all the other horrible things that come along with breaking down. I am 55 years of age and 22 years ago I went through Clinical Depression and it took me almost 18 months to recover. I had no help no support and what I went through only god knows. I lost my wife, house, children and my mind in the process. Eventually I recovered and unexpectedly and a new partner came into my life, she was full of love, compassion, care and thanks to her my miserable life found love and hope again. We have been together for 20 years and now she is going through a full breakdown. Between us our relationship has been one of love, friendship and love being with each other. Some 20 months ago she had a minor midlife crisis and moved to her mums, she was riddled with guilt thinking how much it was hurting me, but somehow the fact, that I knew that her issues were to do with her own and not me gave me the strength to stay strong, at peace and be there for her, always loving supportive and reassuring. She moved in with her mum for six months and unfortunately though she is not aware of it her family and their expectations of her have been a major contribution to her persona of being a peoples pleaser and thinking of others before her self. After being with her mum for six months, we found a new beautiful apartment and move in together again. While I was at work she decided to study from home but being alone during the day and not having dealt with her issues and demons slowly broke her down until she was miserable and full of self hate, health issues,sadness,depression and slowly there was nothing left of her. As much as I tried to encourage her I was unable to help her. She left 8 weeks ago and has moved in back with her mum as she can not be left alone, she was unable to stay with me because she could not be surrounded by her life. Thankfully she has good medical support and counselling. We talk to each other ever few days and as always I am loving, supportive and never put any pressure on her in any way. However for the past week my mind has gone into thoughts of fear and suddenly I am also in a very bad way. I am not eating, full of tears, fear of the unknown, riddled with anxiety and finding it hard to cope, indeed I am sinking fast. I can not let her know what is happening to me as it would devastate her. My fear is, that somehow our love with die and she will not come back. Dear God help me.

Dear all
I didn't think I would have to seek help - but I am really in need of advice ...
For my whole life, I have pretended to play the part of the strong person - the unemotional person. I find my feelings are very cold to those who are nearest and dearest to me - and end up mistreating them . 
My relaitionship with my family - is a loving one - I absolutely love them to death - but I find in myself I get so cold - and have hateful thoughts . 
Most of my closest girlfriends I have either pushed away or have left me.
the father of my child has also left me . And now my own child has no interest in me (side note - the only person I ever truly express the most emotion is to him )
i look at all the people around me and I consider just packing up and leaving and starting a new life by myself - which is the better option out of the thoughts in my head . I want to leave everyone and forget everyone - but I am scared to take that step. I honestly do not think I will be missed if this happens .
 Help - am I making the right choice ?
kind regards
lost ...

Hi, I wish I was not writing my thoughts on this forum but I am. To me this means I am in a dark space so I am therefore really glad to be letting some of my stuff out on this forum. Suffering from depression from a young age (some years worse than others) I never give up trying to help myself, it has been  couple of years now since I have slipped into the dark hole I find myself today but hey tomorrow is another day. How ever bad i think i feel you only need to look around the world and just think of how desperate and unsafe much of the world population is. When I was young to middle age I tried to block out my life I have since found that does not work, what to me does work is to be kind to myself, use meds if appropriate for you, counselling if available and try to stay out of my own head as much as possible, I can and do make situations so much worse if I delve to deeply into things which I should just let be. I contacted my Psychologist by email yesterday he phoned me within an hour and what a pleasure it was to talk to him, he had many positive thing to say which cheered me heaps, I must admit i have seen many Psychologists over the years and know you need to find the right one for you. I live in a isolated rural environment and am relying of forums like this for contact as not to feel so isolated and unconnected.
Thats all for now.

It's taken me years to get to this point, and a couple of hours just to get the wording right, but I think I'm ready to finally say it out loud (or rather 'type' it out loud, so to speak). 
 I have depression. I feel worthless, unlovable, completely lacking in energy and enthusiasm, and I can't remember the last time I felt happy. 
I have very low self worth - I've stopped going out with friends, and often find excuses not to go out with my workmates because I am very introverted and get exhausted by social contact very quickly. I also find it difficult to make new friends, and have never been in a proper relationship because I don't feel like I'm worth loving. Every time I get close I pull away, because I'm scared they'll find out how unlovable I am (and in the case of relationships I feel like I would be preventing them from being with someone that deserves their love). 
 I've never been suicidal, but constantly fantasize about flying away - changing my name and becoming a new person. I know that won't 'fix' me, but I feel such cognitive dissonance between my ideal and real self, I feel like a fraud, and I don't feel like I am who I should be. 
I don't expect anyone to fix me, least of all on an online forum, but I'm too scared to talk to someone about my feelings. I'm about to apply for a 2 year VISA to the UK , and I'll admit that a part of me is worried that a doctor would talk me out of it (I've been wanting to do this for over a decade, and it's honestly the only thing I've been excited about in a long time), but more importantly, I get very defensive and hate talking about myself, a one on one conversation is my idea of hell. Even thinking about going to the doctor and saying all of this out loud makes me feel anxious.
 
Having finally gotten that all out, I don't feel like I've even scratched the surface. I hope it all makes sense

Hey,
Ive got this thing that I've struggled with a long time and it hit me yesterday whilst I was Christmas shopping. I went out to my local shopping centre with a friend to do some shopping. Before I left home, I put a dress on, hair done, make up on - ready to go and feeling ok with how I looked - even looked in the mirror at home and thought 'yep ok' asked my husband for reassurance and he said I looked great. 
The problem is that when I get to the shops and amongst people, I feel like the ugliest and worst dressed person there. I truly believe that everyone (and I mean everyone - from the young right up to the very old) are prettier and are looking far better than me. I can ignore it for a bit until I walk past a mirror in a clothes shop and then I'm blatantly reminded of it. 
Ive also put on a bit of weight lately. My logical brain tells me that I'm not that big and I can always loose it but the other side of my brain tells me I'm disgusting.  I've struggled a bit as a teenager (33 now) with restricting food and vomiting after meals but that is long gone. 
I just don't know what this is?!? I plan to talk to my psychologist about it at my next appointment. Has anyone had this before and how did you manage it. It's kind of like at home I look like one person but when I get amongst people I look terrible. I get it at the hairdresser too. Before I leave home I'm feeling ok but when I get sat in front of a mirror with all these beautiful people around me, I feel so inferior and want to crawl into a hole. 
I thought that maybe it was an intrusive thought linked to my OCD but it's not really like my other intrusive thoughts.

I have seen a psychologist previously and counsellor and was wondering if its worth booking into a psychiatrist and even trying meditation as well, I would like to do Yoga but 3 back operations wont allow that, I walk a lot and do my own cricket coaching which keeps me busy but I would be grateful if anyone has some ideas that might help me in this journey.....I know its hard at the moment but I am trying to soften the blow a bit, thanks.

I'm just sitting here and crying. I don't even know what made me, but all I can  feel is my heavy heart and a choked feeling in my throat. 
I have a family too, my wife and my 6 year old princess. I should be celebrating with them but here I am, writing here...
I don't need any support from people here, just want to write this here and just be forgotten. If someone reading this feels depressed, then I am sorry, it was not my intention. 
I don't know where I get this feeling from, but I think, if I were to suddenly disappear someday, not many people I know would realize I'm not there anymore... And please let me make myself clear, I am not getting suicidal thoughts, I am strong, not doing anything like that. I just don't think I can make a difference to anyone's life at all. I'm just expendable, replaceable...
Sure, I do things to keep my mind away from thinking this way, like having a hobby, playing music...but every now and then this feeling creeps up on me and reminds me of truth I'm trying to suppress. 
Some days are just too hard to get by, and I hope I've not upset anyone reading this but I just wanted to let it out.

Hi All,
​So it's xmas day and I can't stop crying.  I'm working today in a remote part of Australia so just want some support to get through the day.  I've been suffering from glandular feve for about 3 months so I'm already feeling pretty run down and I read somewhere that depression is linked to this virus. I am also having to face my ex at work who broke it off when I first got sick which isn't helping. I haven't been able to stop crying all day and there's no real reason. 
Any support or suggestions would be appreciated.

I think some of my depression and aniexty stems from body issues I have. I'm a 29yr old female who people find attractive and I get a lot of attention from men. I can admit I have a pretty face. But I feel my body lets me down.. And in all honestly I swear I have the rarest kind of body type in this world. Not even kidding. I've googled trying to find another woman with a shape like mine and I've come across one, that was similar but not the same. 
I know this sounds silly.. But this is only one of my issues I have but one that really really gets me down. I have no body confidence, and it's hard when I get reminded from family, strangers coming up to me making a comment.. It's really hindered my confidence that It's effected other areas of my life, especially socially. I find it hard forming new friendships in fear of judgement and also getting envolved with new a relationship. 
I'm a skinny girl, if you can imagine boney shoulders, like really Viney shoulders and a protruding collarbone, and arms when i go to move to drink from a cup they look like anorexic arms like I haven't eaten in months, narrow waist with little curves (boy body) then I have big calves! That are not proportionate with the rest of my skinny body. I have so many stretch marks but what really just gets me down is when people say ""you need to eat more"" ""you're soo skinny"" ""omg your arms, they're so small"" and they all say this with disgusted looks and sometimes confusion on their faces. It makes me feel disgusting and that there's something wrong with me :( I friken sucks. Then they look down to my legs and look even more confused and grossed out. 
so to deal with this I try to wear different clothing  so I don't get these responses, I'm limited to what I can actually wear bcos clothes look odd on me due to my unusual shape, and I try to hide my legs under pants and jeans. 
Dont get me wrong I do wear shorts but only when I have built up enough strength in me to pretend I don't have this issue and get on with life. But it's such a struggle among the rest of the crappy feelings I feel at the same time. 
I have never actually let this out, I have not shared this to anyone. I'm not looking for sympathy I think I just needed to get it out.

Hi, I am 15 years of age and have been feeling depressed for pretty much all of 2015.
I have been bullied at school and one of the counselors that i saw at school passed away on the first of december. It has been very difficult for me to cope as my house is being rebuilt so i am not living in my normal home for christmas. This has really upset me as my family has had a tradition of sitting on the lounge on christmas eve watching the carols. But my family has told me that we are going away to my cousins (who live 2 hours away) and spending christmas in our camper van. This has really upset me as i was really looking forward to keeping this tradition and now i have no input in the decision. My parents have also been very hateful towards me and saying that i am lazy and negative all the time. and all this just from not going out of the house for one day of the holidays. They never support me and just say that everything i do isn't right. They think that i am not grateful for the new house that we will have and all they do for me. Which is not true. I am very grateful. I am just finding it very hard to not be negative when all i get is negative feedback from my parents and always being told that i am a bad child. I am very much a home body and get homesick whenever we go away, my parents interpret that as i am hating the trip but that is not the case i just miss home and the familiar surroundings. I just wish i could get a little bit of praise and not always negative feedback. for example i thought i did really well in my report and i gave it to my parents and when i asked my dad all he said was there was areas that should be improved. Which really put me down since i got good results. I just don't know what to do because they just say that the parents are the boss and we do whatever they want us to. my parents have been physical at one stage, hitting me and threatening me. I am just pushed into a corner and don't know what i can do. 
Please help me so i know if this is all in my head or i am depressed for a real reason.

This is my second bout of depression. My 20 year marriage is falling apart. I realised the depression was coming and went to my psych. I discovered we have financial problems on Friday and cried and cried all day and went to my GP Fri night and got a script for the same anti depressants I had 18 months ago. 
Since Friday I've eaten four pieces toast gagging the whole time. I just can't eat. The usual things that take my fancy I gag at the thought of eating. 
 I started my medication on Saturday. I wake up queasy. Monday the queasy went at around 2pm, Tuesday around 11am. Today 9am. 
The pharmacist said they may make me queasy and to persevere. 
 I can't help but think it is the lack of eating that is causing the sickness. I don't so much mind about the lack of appetite but I'd like to be able to actually eat.  I am drinking plenty of water, it is actually helping with the quesiness.

Hi there
I'm new to this forum and honestly thought I had managed to keep everything under wraps pretty well for so long >10years. I have had quite a few major life events happen in quick succession and now my depression an anxiety feels likes its out of control. I can't function and I have missed days at work. Even the days I have managed to make it I do not feel like I'm really there. My boss is aware of my recent loss of my grandmother who raised me but not of a lot of other personal things that have happened, that combined have triggered overwhelming bouts of anxiety and depression. I work in corporate in a sought after role that I was really excited about getting. Now I just feel hopeless, I'm scared I'm going to lose my job and not be able to support my son. I have no fall back. To add to all this my sons biological father has just been released from prison literally a week ago and has decided he wants to be a part of his life and is moving around the corner from us. This is a man who has previously been charged with stalking me amongst other things and went to prison for some pretty messed up things. We were together when we were teenagers and I am a completely different person than him. I thought I was over all the bad things that have happened but when he turned up at my door all the fear and terror just came flooding back. I made an appointment for grief counseling and I have been once, my next appointment is not till mid January due to this time of year. I need to function now and I just feel like an empty shell incapable of doing anything. I don't know what to tell my boss as I feel like I'm seriously underperforming to my usual standard. I have only just recently been promoted to this role. The psychologist said I need to start taking care of myself first, I know this sounds ridiculous but I don't know how on earth to do that with my current commitments to my son and my job. I am not coping. I need to function now

My story in a nutshell is that I suffer from depression and anxiety continuously and have done so for the last 20+ years. Am on a high dose of ADs and they keep it to a just manageable level. I also experience PMDD to add fun to the mix.
What I've found now that I'm on school holidays (I'm a junior primary teacher in a challenging suburb) is that my depression is kicking in big time. I don't have to put on that front of getting myself to school and teaching all day then being exhausted at the end of the day and falling asleep. Now I'm on holidays (6 weeks) I'm finding myself with zero motivation, very anxious, classic not being able to cry symptom as a side effect of ADs and having to parent through all of that with my child home 24/7.
It feels like all she wants, as a single child, is to be entertained. My guilt level is through the roof, feeling like I should be keeping her busy and having fun. The house is a shambles with housework piling up. If I had my choice I would be sleeping all day. I just sit on the computer and she sits watching tv. I want to be able to cry and vent but the AD's stop me from doing even that.
I'm falling in a hole and I don't have family support to help me out. Having to go to work was helping me keep it together but not it's not there so I'm failing.
Any suggestions? TIA.

How did this happen how does someone that is so independent so strong and capable turn into a burden to the ones they love the most. 
My anxiety and depression been at its worst the last 2 months scary at times but now I find I'm sick physically I've caught bug my son brought home can't shake it started to feel better last night and bam wake up with migraine worst one in ages. My poor husband stayed home yesterday to give me hand chance to rest and hopefully get well he came home at lunch to check on me to find me hiding in the dark really unwell with migraine I could see the look of oh really what next!
 he is amazing support but I feel like my mind and body is failing me and I can't do what I need to do as a mum or wife he and the kids deserve so much more than me. 
I used to be the rock of my family I sorted everything and took care of everyone would hardly ever get sick and push through it when I did. Now I seem to catch every bug and it hits me hard.
How long will my family put up with me I'm not the person they love anymore!

when somebody we love has developed depression and they can't tell you, is sad and upsetting, because all we want to do is help them through this terrible journey, and then take their hand and guide them through the tough times ahead, because without doubt, it's a path they have never encountered before.

I have severe depression and I think it's about time to get rid of it.
If people can cure other diseases then why not depression?
I am not going to mask this thing with medication. I am going to eat healthy, and avoid sugar like the plague. I am going to exercise more. Drink more green tea. I am going to watch funny movies and go places even if I have no motivation. I am going to quit smoking. I am going to listen to more meditation. I am going to try damn hard to think positive. I am going to try to get rid of this bastard once and for all. I will try neuroplasticity techniques. I will not let this thing eat away the rest of my life!
Even if I have to pretend to feel emotion. If something sad happens I will pinch myself until I cry. If something exciting happens I will jump up and down and smile. If I feel I should be angry I will frown. If I practice feeling emotion, maybe one day I will.
Does anyone else have any tips for me? I am going to cure my depression.

Weird when you have so much to say but feelings are hard to express.  Seems words can't describe the gravity if ones heart ache. The atmosphere of my house is heavy, I wear the burden.  My guilt, my loveless, lifeless existence makes me weaker every day. People are so dismissive of my emotions... If I fall down the people I prop up fall too. It feels like my pain is irrelevant, I'm screaming in the Forest. Words can't describe the weight on my shoulders the pressure on my chest... feeling so alone

Hi Guys 
i am averaging 1 depressive episode per week anywhere from 4 hours to 2 days since kicking my meds 7 months ago. the other 5 days are great filled with closeness to my wife and I find it hard to remember what depression fills like , the BAM something is said  and triggers the black dog ! 
Im looking for advice of coping methods? at the moment I end up alienating my wife , she try's to talk to me when I start spiralling down checking if I'm ok but a lot of questions frustrating and end up snapping then I go through a stage of getting angry with the kids and her which ends in a row, the I get to the sad/crying phase when I climb under the covers listen to sad music and cry when this is done I feel physically drained and mope around for a few hours then it lifts.
i can see my wife getting more and more worn down each time and it puts our releonship back a few steps every time ( we are trying to become close again and regain sex life after no sex on meds)...... Does anyone have similar issues ? Or advise on the best way to cope? Ideally I would like to live with this weekly episode without if affecting my family 
 
TIA

Wow what can I say.. I have been on this site minamum a week.. And all I can say is wow, 
you all have helped me, it's hard to explain.
I be found it hard to find some one to talk to that actually understands me,  I hadn't found that in so many years that I thought I was starting to go mad, 
bam one week with you guys and my attitude has changed, my view on life has changed. I'm even understanding i may not be as mad as I thought I was, I'm finding such positive attitudes and just helpful advice and information, I find I can be totally honest and express myself, 
and that's thanks to the broude range of experiences and minds, found in the forums here, 
Thankyou, everybody have their own situations going on, but we all stop and express and share, you are so positive and helpful, by doing that you are not just helping others, but also helping ourselves.
tip of the day.. If you love and care for someone, u don't always have to agree with them, we are all Intilted to our opinions, but if you learn to understand them, they will learn to understand you. 
 
God bless

I'm in my 30's and 3 years ago I spit from a long time relationship, he kept the kids due to me having to move into my car for a bit. I took it to court to get visits and I do, I see them every second weekend, but for the past 3 years I just haven't been able to make anything work. I always end up worse of at the end of the year then when it started. 
Last year ended with me living in a back packers and not really having much going for me. 
During the year I got a good paying job and a apartment and everything seemed to be going ok for a few months, but the apartment block was to noisy and was affecting my work so I left and moved in with a friend. Well not even a month later I lose my job, I lose my licence, and my house mate kicked me out all in a space of 3 months. Now I back living in my car with out a licence and I can't even see my kids. I'm extremely depressed and just feel sick all the time, I'm nasty and hurtful to people and I'm just not a nice person to be around.
 I didn't have a good childhood my parents bought me to wa as a kid and dumped me on the side of the road the day we go here and I haven't seen them since, 
I just feel like I'm a failure in life I can't do anything right
i cant bare not seeing the kids they are only 6 n 8. And I feel like I've let them down so much. 
I suck at living life and I don't know what to do.

So the last couple of days have been down days after about a week or so of feeling great.
I find myself fighting off tears and telling myself I can do this, I can beat it and I am strong. Sometimes I just try and psych myself up in my head, other times I say literally it out loud to my boyfriend! ""I'm going to beat this, I'm going to because I want to.""
I was wondering if anyone else does this? Does anyone else talk themselves into going out of the house or into not just slumping on the couch and giving up? And if so, what do you say? What gets you moving?

I came across a quote about anxiety/depression the other day that said something along the lines of: when we (the ""depressed"") have a good day, our initial thought is not to enjoy it but to worry about how long it will last.
sad but true.
I have had a few good days recently, which I know is a huge positive as I have barely had any good days this year, only to wake up the next day feeling crappy again. 
It amazes me how my moods can change so drastically from one day to the next. Why is that? 
On a good day, I almost forget what it's like to be depressed. This illness really is deceptive isn't it - it makes you think you're better and can't imagine how it felt before and then BAM, you remember again.
This emptiness, lack of motivation, frustration... Just to go to bed and hope tomorrow is one of the good days.
sorry for the rambling, just had to get my thoughts out there.

For the last four or so weeks I have had an overwhelming feeling of sadness, that I just can’t overcome.  I went and saw my GP who thought it was a level of depression I could manage with exercise and psychological intervention (I did not want to start taking medication).  I have not yet seen the psychologist (waiting lists where I live) and despite exercising vigorously 4-5 times per week, the sadness has just gotten worse and worse.  I’m having trouble sleeping, and crying frequently for no apparent reason.  I’ve lost interest in eating, work, and am struggling to care for my children.  I also have anxiety about things that ‘might' happen – I may be unemployed at the end of the financial year (but I may not).  I went and saw my GP again yesterday and she strongly recommended I commence medication, which I did last night.  I know that the medication will take several days/weeks to start having an effect, but can anybody suggest any self-help strategies in the meantime.  I’m a person who likes to be in control of everything, and these feelings are just awful.

Hello,
I'm in my mid-twenties and I have dysthymia (persistent mild depression), which has come about since I was a teenager.
I'm wondering if anyone has this disorder and may be able to recommend a good psychologist (in Sydney) to speak to? I have seen a psychologist twice before, for anxiety, but I don't feel I got what I needed out of that psychologist's approach, I felt it was very short-term rather than long-term solution focused. I wonder if anyone has had a good experience with a psychologist or psychiatrist who helped them with dysthymia? 
 It is something I keep putting off seeking help for, probably because it is so invisible in a way. With anxiety, I had panic attacks, those were very apparent symptoms that needed attention. With dysthymia, I kind of kept hoping things would get better, because it's not like I can't function or get out of bed. But for the last year I've actually struggled to cope.
I feel worthless all the time. I have little to no friends. At work I struggle to smile and hide my sad days and I ""feel down"" very easily, it only takes a small mishap for me to go into what I call ""The Well"", I'm not sure if other people experience this, but it's like you're doing fine, walking along like normal, and then all of sudden someone says something (or forgets to say something) and you're not looking and you fall into the well, it's dark, practically no light, and only negative thoughts are there, and it's very heavy, it actually feels like an anchor weighing down your heart, and once you're down there it's a struggle to get back up. My co-workers must think I hate my job, but I don't, I just don't derive pleasure and excitement from anything in the way they do - and I've pretty much been this way since my teens. But I don't want to be a gloomy person. 
I would like to stop avoiding this problem and speak to someone about it, but to someone who will take it seriously and not dismiss it. I'd prefer a cognitive or talking therapy based approach. I've been trying for years to overcome it myself, but I've hit a complete wall and can't go any further. I'd really appreciate some help if anyone can offer advice on some good people to talk to, or tell me about strategies that have helped you?
Thanks everyone.

It's been years of ups and downs and I guess I've got better at dealing with my depression by either hiding how I feel or just dealing with it. It's got to a point where I'm frustrated with just 'functioning' ok and being in every situation and watching others have fun and feel like I can't break through that barrier and feel the same way. Just want opinions on when you feel like your at a point where things can't get better, what do you do? What are the options out there for someone who feels like things may never feel any better?

Hi guys, I'm Sonja, and I'm new to this site.
I came here seeking help, advice, and to just try and make a little headway in understanding things.
I'm a mother, and have been increasingly finding things difficult, mainly over the last 2 years, my feelings have been increasing, causing some pretty unwarranted and uncomfortable issues, and I'm really getting to a point of trying to make at least a little sense of the goings on.
one of my biggest fears, is when I have a bout, (which can last anywhere from a mere few days to an exceedingly uncomfortable few weeks)
but the most disconcerting part of getting so upset, feeling sad, angry and alone, isn't THOSE feelings, as much as an extremely heavy and crushing heartbreak feeling.
sometimes, I can see why it happens, and to a degree I understand the causality of it, but of late (last 2 years) it has been increasing, so much so that, the episodes, which I see the reasoning and understand why it happens, are decreasing, and the instances for it happening without something as a trigger are increasing. now as I said before my sad, angry and lonely feelings, aren't so much the problem, as this heartbreak feeling. 
These days, I can almost sense when it's going to happen, but there's nothing I can do to stop it. 
when I understand what causes it, it still hurts, but it's all the more easier to handle, when it's triggered without arational reason, it's all the more difficult to cope with, and in spite of this, my loving partner still stands by me, and I KNOW I don't make it easy for him, or my 2 lovely, miraculous, gorgeous children, that all do so much for me.
but I just can't shake this feeling that things aren't right, and then the heartbreak feeling sets in and I can cry for days, or even WEEKS, and it thoroughly upsets and drains me.
has anyone else ever felt like this? 
Does anyone have some simple suggestions to maybe slow down, and curb this monster?

When I think it cannot get any worse, death of hubby 8 weeks ago mentioned in previous thread, i get broken in to. Police were called, fingerprinting done, but this or these low life scumbags entered my home. Yes they took plenty of stuff, but what is really killing me is that they took my hubbys wedding rings, bracelet, watch and signet ring. I am more heart broken by this than by other things that I have lost.
No I feel more uneasy about being on my own. My sleep, depression and anxiety was bad it has just gone through the roof. I doubt I have had more than a couple of hours of broken sleep each night. I hear every noise, real and imaginary. I dont want to leave the house for fear they may come back, even though I have been told it is highly unlikely.
I am at my lowest. I didnt realise I could cry so much. I just feel violated.
My family and friends are great support, but I cannot keep using them.
How the hell do I go on now? I have lost my hubby, my rock, my partner, my friend and these mongrels have done this. Life is so bloody unfair.
Feeling so sad, so lost, so angry, so down.

I have reluctantly (but willingly) joined this forum in an attempt to address an issue that I wasn't aware of until recently. I am 29 years old and I have a young daughter who lives with her mother and a gorgeous partner who is by my side every step of the way. I do however, find myself questioning purpose and have experienced symptoms related to depression mainly around loss of interest at work, personal connections and in personal development. There are periods in the day where I am trapped inside my own head having off topic thoughts and running scenarios of discussions and actions which I rarely act upon. My days are filled with distractions and lack of productivity which is highly unnatural to me and it is bleeding from work into personal elements of my life. There are also  periods of the day that I feel disconnected from my old friends and family as I emigrated to Australia to ""live the dream"".Depression/Anexiety/Low self esteem caused by the ebb and flow of life, amplified with the pressure of needing to be a strong and reliable man/father/protector/boss/money earner built up over well I do not know when it was all a distant memory. A recent 11 year relationship break up seems to be the trigger to some of this but I would not say all of it. There are elements in my life which are high pressure and there are elements that I can relax. Alcohol has become a problem but one in which I am dealing with progressively. I have recently been to the doctors who were supportive but could tell this was not a topic i was open to discuss with a stranger (i know right on the internet is much safer). I feel a lot of support around this issue is direct to women and the elderly who have loss/emotional experiences that lead to their feelings. I am in full support to these people but I haven't really found support around the issues I am experiencing. To be honest I am not even sure myself what they are so how could I trust someone to tell me to take/do this if I am not sure what I am telling them is the truth or my version of it! What am I looking for on this forum? The opportunity to connect with similar guys in my situation where there is no questionnaire or diagnosis that I can't lie around to get a ""moderate"" result. To hear about activities that others have undertaken to get positive results and any advice that is available for someone who thinks they might be depressed, shows all the symptoms of low level depression but doesn't really have any reason to be.

Yesterday I finally plucked up the courage to go to my gp.
i have been sooooo tired for the last 3-6mo months and I'm constantly finding reasons to be angry at someone, cause it makes more sense then just being angry at nothing or worse still crying over nothing??!! 
It doesn't make sense, it's as if I've forgotten how to be happy, or how to find enjoyment in anything! 
I used to love playing with my kids, now I find excuses not too because I'm scared of what I might feel, why is that ? My kids are the light in my life but I can't smile with them..... That's not logical ???
my hubby says that he can't take my mood for much longer, and I don't blame him, I don't want to be with me why would he?
I'm usually a very logical, light hearted person but last week I went away for work and on my way home on the second day I became overtly anxious that I needed to say goodnight to my kids...... Logically I knew they would be doing their homework and getting ready for bed after their sport activities in the afternoon but it didn't reduce the panic I felt at not hearing them and saying goodnight??? 
I don't understand why I feel this way, I feel I can't speak about it in my small country town because my job is a high stress position which requires me to support highly traumatised people, but I can't go on like this........ I'm sooooo tired all the time and my body aches 80% of the time! I can't find my motivation let alone show some capacity to be an understanding mum/wife.

Hi,
Depression, I first felt depressed in my late primary school years being picked on and called names certainly didn't help, As the months and years went on my depression became worse through high school where more bullying was happening on a daily basis. I thought I had good friends but I found that when I left high school I realised they weren't friends at all, I was in such a deep dark hole. I became very isolated when I left school no social life or friends when all the while I knew and felt I was becoming more depressed, this was compounded by not telling anyone about my depression and about the bullying as I had lost all faith in teachers looking out for students like myself they didn't stop the bullying in fact it got worse if the students knew I told on them.
I did so many courses in the immediate years leaving school in the hope of getting a job, nothing came up even though I completed so many courses this just crushed me inside I so desperate to get a job.  It was in 2005 when a medical condition I have had to be operated on as I was legally blind at the time of surgery, everything seemed so dark and so hard with my depression getting worse with each month, the unemployment at the time becoming a real issue and recovering from a transplant to save my sight, I was in a hole.
My first real opportunity came in 2007 where I started work at a local fast food franchise, initially it was such a good feeling to be able to work and to feel like I was contributing in some way. While at McDonalds the environment changed and I felt my depression was coming back it did in a big way, in 2012 I left McDonalds I had to leave. I left at the start of 2012 during this time I enrolled in an automotive course while looking for work. In 2013 little did I know this was the year where my depression would come to ahead, it did in August having spent almost 2 years unemployed. It was at this point that I was able to speak to someone and finally tell how I was feeling, I never told anyone I had depression for 14-15 I kept this dark secret to myself. As I am describing how I am feeling I am waiting to go to hospital my first visit. I stay in hospital for a week or so it was horrible, I come back home only to find I cannot stop crying I needed to find support services and groups.
I quickly found some support services and groups who help and assist people like myself. I became involved in there programs and groups without knowing how much they would help me, they helped me a great deal thinking about it now. In 2014 I was still not a 100% my depression was still evident and I still had a drive to work but I needed to help myself first so I could work. In March I had my 2nd hospital admission this time at more suitable better environment hospital I knew each time before during and after a hospital visit I was making progress, later in the year I had my 3rd and final hospital visit which helped me just that bit more. Not long after being out from hospital I grabbed an opportunity without knowing how much it would help me it got me back into work and it was that decision that one last bit of hope that has turned out to be one of my best decisions ever. I grabbed at the chance to get back into the workforce and I haven't looked back since. This year I have made so much progress that I would never had though about making.
I hope to anyone who reads this gets inspired to keep on going because just when you feel like giving up it can take just that one chance one opportunity to turn your life around and make some serious progress.
Always cling onto hope never let it go and always seek help and support when you feel you need too.
Take care all
Chris

Hi,  I just joined this group.  I'm not really a 'forum user' but might become one😆I'm just feeling like shit, I think it may be depression.  I was put on  treatment for depression/stress/anxiety a couple of years ago.  I think it helped at the time but then I had that 'zombie, can't be bothered doing anything, never feel happy or sad or anything' type of life, so I did the cold turkey . That sucked bad but withina few weeks I felt better. Now I'm just blah, and I don't know why. I've got a gorgeous son, an amazing fiance that loves me, a successful little business. Why aren't I happy?

I've been dealing with depression & anxiety since 2000. This isn't new to me.But every time I get into a real bout, I find myself floundering. Right now, I wake up every morning at about 5am with a huge weight on my chest. I know what it is and I know why it's there and it's not welcome. I try to do breathing exercises & relax so I can get that extra 2 hours before my alarm goes off. But most of the time my efforts are fruitless and I just toss and turn feeling horrible. I can only seem eat at dinner time which to me is a marker of my mood.I've been going to work, but I haven't been able to bring myself to put on any makeup or even brush my hair. I just throw on some clothes and put my hair in a bun.I get there and I just feel miserable. I try to engage with people, but even whilst I'm talking to them I have these thoughts & feelings nagging away at me. I can barely do my work. I'm slower and less creative, which is bad because my job requires me to be creative.This all stems from fear. I'm pretty much afraid of everything. I'm afraid of crowds, I'm afraid of new places. For a while I was afraid of food, I'm afraid I will fall apart when my dog dies. I'm afraid of getting sick, I'm afraid of other people getting sick, I'm afraid of losing people and not being in control and most of all I'm afraid of death. My mother lives in the UK has cancer and I know she will not recover from it. I don't know how long she has, but I am absolutely petrified of losing her & I think that is the catalyst for this current recurrence of my anxiety & depression. I'm terrified of flying, but I know if I want to see her, I have to. But feeling the way I do is making it even harder. She has been my rock my entire life & the thought of a world without her in it leaves me feeling absolutely hopeless.Today is the first day I just haven't been able to go to work. I woke up this morning and just couldn't face it. I actually thought I had a pretty good day yesterday & even felt hungry, until I got home & burst into tears for no real reason & started talking about death.My partner is so understanding. He has depression also so knows this will pass, & so do I, I know this isn't forever. But right now, as I sit here, I have those same thoughts I have every time this happens ""what if it doesn't go away this time?"".I don't know if I'm meant to ride this out, push it until it goes away, acknowledge it and work through it. I feel like I've done all these things before & it keep coming back.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I think of my depression as a dark passenger that arrives whenever he feels like it, for a journey. It can be a long trip or occasionally a short one.  I have been able to avoid him for a while but there he is again, taking up a space in the car for a ride.  I have been managing my depression and anxiety without medication or counselling for a few years now.  I try to look after myself but at the moment it is getting harder.  I am finding it hard to see the positive in anything, including myself.  The panic is rising and it gets harder to keep it under control.
I just felt like i needed to find a place to speak, without judgement.  It can be hard in our lives to feel that we can speak about our feelings without people making light of our circumstances.  I have been reading posts on here all day and I think this place is amazing. I would love to hear from others who have a passenger with them or understand what I mean.

First time poster,
 psychologist gave me some web pages to check out after sitting some sessions , part of my mental plan ,where to begin....
 it has been an exhausting few years, I seem to be in a downspiral at the moment , suffering from depression, anxiety and sleep issues.
 i currently have this sleep issue, a dream which has occurred a few times exactly the same way where I am thinking that I could die if I swallowed something in a way and in my dream I swallow it and I wake up gasping for air , this scares the crap out of my wife.
 i think these issues I have are taking a toll on my wife,I'm worried all the time that this might be too much for her. I try to explain things to her the best I can, I just always seem to be in a flat mood all the time, sometimes some glimpses of happiness, but doesn't seem to last long .
 I have 2 children on the autism spectrum, my son had a head operation when he was very young due to his head fusing too quickly when he was born, they are great kids - I do try to give them whatever I have left at the day.
 i am struggling at the moment to see them, I have been doing shift work for the last 6 years and 14 days a month I don't see them or am in a limited state of mind.
 i do the shift work because it's comfortable for me, I don't see a lot of people during the time only for overlapping hours from normal shift workers for a coupe of hours later in the morning or first thing in the Arvo.
 from what I do I don't seem to be open with people , only when they are in my direct path , I wouldn't call myself a very sociable person, I try, I just don't think people see that in me and I suppose I have missed out on a lot of opportunities.
 i suppose it really comes down to me being confident which I have never had due to a bad relationship with my father, it's weird now.. Only now at the end is my father tolerable , we get along but I can still see the bad things I seen as a child, now I just feel sorry for him and disappointed .
i think mostly about regrets these days.
 i remember when I was around 15 I had a girl come up to me, this is a girl I had the biggest crush on , she asked me out and I asked "" are you serious?"" She ran off and cried, I assume I said this the wrong way as I would have said yes if I thought it wasn't a prank or something. I tried to explain but her friends wouldn't let me near her.
 lots of little things in my head, sorry if this is all over the place and a long read .

Hi everyone..I'm new and not sure if a similar thread already exists but if it does, I couldn't find it!I'm in my mid twenties and I've struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 15. As you all probably know what it feels like - the ups and the terrible downs and then the ups again, it's gone on and on and I try my best to remain positive although some days, the best I can do is just get out of bed. For the last 5 months, I've been in a relationship with a lovely guy. This is my first serious relationship in about 8 years. But on my bad days when I can't stop crying I want to push him away and I want to break it off with him so he doesn't have to deal with me and my depression.
 have any of you struggled with this? Any tips? Thanks

Hi there, this is my first post. I have been on medication for two years and twice I have been to my GP to get advice on free councilling but I don't follow it up because I feel so foolish. I think I have been depressed most of my adult life but never recognised it as such. I used to believe I was a really nice kind person and couldn't understand the terrible things that happened to me. Now I know I am not a nice person at all and I have chosen my own fate time and time again. I'm trying to be a better person but I'm also realising now I'm not too smart either. Every decision I make to improve my life seems to be a poor one. I understand I can't outrun the depression so my questions are : how do I stop comparing myself to others. Others who can make it through the hard times in marriage. Others who are good parents. Others who are talented and are smart enough to work hard at that talent and achieve a level of success they are happy with whether at work, home hobbies, sport etc. others who finish what they start. Others who can accept who they are and be happy. Others who have a passion. Even others who make similar mistakes as I but don't seem to suffer the consequences. I know comparison is a fools thinking and I know I have not walked in others shoes. I just wish I had it in me to lead a successful life. I just don't know how to accept who I have been put on this earth to be and I definitely don't know how to accept how me thinking like this has affected my children. I have never really had a mind of my own and when I finally took charge I completely and utterly made a mess of that too. In the past I did fall into the trap of expecting things and others to make me happy. Now I know only I can do that ... except I can't. I've failed at that too.

Hello,
You might have seen me post here before. I fid it really helps to air my thoughts and feelings in a safe place.
It all started in early September. Depression had been sneaking up on me for some time, but I chose to ignore it. Then I lost my job and it absolutely sent me over the edge. My confidence was completely shattered and I had to deal with everything I'd been blocking out.
You see, I've never been in a relationship before. I discovered at 13 that I was terrified of the prospect (I still don't know why) and haven't even had so much as a crush on someone since then. In order to keep myself happy I simply immersed myself in my job and spent lots of time with friends. Now that I'm almost 29, all of my friends are either with someone or have moved overseas. I'm incredibly lonely and fear I will be this way for the rest of my life.
I've started a new job but I don't get much satisfaction from it. Our family dog passed away recently and the apartment I rent was sold. My housemate told me she no longer wanted to live with me anymore because of the anxiety and depression. To top it off, my grandmother is not doing so great. I haven't considered the option of losing her because this is too much for my brain to bear right now.
I don't sleep or eat much. I spent last weekend at my parents house, shaking and crying the whole time. I spoke to my mum last night and she sounded so strained and worried. I feel terrible for doing this to her.
I've been taking medication and seeing a psychologist but it doesn't seem to be helping. Thanks for listening.

I am new on here and I am not sure where to start really. My feelings of anxiety and hopelessness are very overwhelming, I know that much.
I have been drinking heavily quite lately, usually on my days off. I drink to block out past events in my life and I am causing a lot of hurt to my beautiful wife.
When I am alone, I cry an awful lot and hate myself for being like this.

Hi, my first post here... I have been living with depression for as long as I remember, but only realised and had treatment since I was about 30. But the treatment feels like a smoke screen, not even sure if it works as I still have desperately low times. I have learnt to cope with life, but not live my life. I sweep thoughts under the carpet. Try not to look back or forward but just cope day by day...yes I get out of bed and go to work, paint that smile on my face and do everything I can to make others happy. But as I sit here writing this the tears just won't stop. I feel so alone. I moved to Australia 2yrs ago, trying for yet another 'FRESH START' but I now realise there is no such thing as I can't run away from myself. I am 46 in a few weeks and have worked hard all my life but have achieved nothing. I know I'm having a low and the light will come back, but that doesn't help now....

I've been going through this cycle for a while where I know i need to get up n go to work an just can't. I work myself up n try be positive night before but then the time comes and I struggle and get angry bout it or just don't care if I feel literally sick bout it all and can't do it! I've been on n off anti depressants since 2012, but recently felt like they were doing more harm then good and stop taking them. I was having bad thoughts n terrible dreams and wasn't getting any sleep. I have tryed counselling once but felt like I was being looked at and treated like a looser and that they were like if you know what you need to do then why arnt you doing it. My partner try's and helps but thinks I'm just lazy. Am I? I don't think I am? I'm sick of feeling this way and I need it to change but don't know how, if I go to gp I'll get out back on meds and I'm scared to speak to a counsellor but I want to. So I guess that's why I'm now posting on here, to see if anyone else can help or knows what I'm going through... I dunno I'm just sick of everything being so hard and can't talk to family or friends bout it for fear I'll be looked at or treated different!

I have suffered from depression since i was 16 and have always been on medication. Im now 28 and a year ago i came off all medication as i was stable for years and didn't think this would happen again. For the last few months i have been struggling and this last week i have just fallen into a dark hole. I have been to see my GP and have to wait another week to see a Psychiatrist so i guess I'm just looking for someone to talk to in between. 
I feel so lost and alone and i don't know how to make it go away. I don't want to do anything i just want to sleep cause thats the only time i can't feel any pain or my head isn't overthinking. I feel all these mixed emotions I'm angry, hurt, sad, scared, lonely, numb and i just burst out into tears for no reason at all. I wish someone could feel how i feel inside so they could help me. I feel like I'm loosing control of myself and i want to stop it but i don't know how. 
I just want to be my old self again and when i smile i want it to be a real smile.

Been feeling nothing every now and then. This usually happens when I get overwhelmed with work. I just turn into this passive and unmotivated person. Been having difficulties with trying to be happy.. Happiness has been a foreign thing to me for years now.. I just always feel tired of being here coz i feel like I'm just existing and not actually living. Pardon for the random thoughts. Hope someone can relate and give some advice. Thanks.

My partner doesn't understand depression or anxiety, she has never experienced either. I need to talk to her but don't want to be a bother and don't know what it would achieve to talk to her. I've told her I'm depressed, about a month ago. How do I talk to my partner if she has no idea what I'm talking about?

Hi.. im new here and wanted to chat to others going through the same thing as i feel no one around me understands it (except my brother who has depression). 
 I feel sad all the time worthless useless empty alone and like a failure. I feel like I've failed and dissapointed my family especially my kids.
I wake up every day with nothing there nothing to look foward to.
I say and do things that hurt the people im ment to love and feel no remorse. Its like i dont care.
Things i used to be able to do that i enjoyed doing are such an effort.
There are days i dont want to see anyone or do a thing i just stare at things blank and have no idea what im doing or y. Some days i cry n cry and dont no y im crying.. i have days where i can push it all down and continue on but its getting harder and harder to do.. smiling feels strange. I feel trapped in this world in this mind  like im stuck in a dark empty whole and i cant get out of it...
This week i went to my dr and she started me on anti depressants ive also seen a psychologist but i struggle to open up and talk. I just want this to go away.

Hey everyone, 
First of all thanks for taking the time to read my post. I'm a 25 year old uni student and I am currently really struggling a lot with recurrent depression. At the moment I'm finding it very hard trying to cope with the feelings of loneliness and isolation I am experiencing. This is really frustrating as I am quite a social person who has lots of close friends, but at the moment I feel very isolated and alone. I think a large part of this stems from the fact that nearly every friend of mine is currently in a long-term relationship, and many are beginning to get engaged/married/buying a house together etc. 
I really struggle with a long-held belief that I will be alone forever, and that nobody could ever really love me for who I am. My psychologist and I agree that one way to challenge this would be to meet new people and develop experiences that are alternative to these thoughts/beliefs. However, I am struggling to think of ways to meet new people (last relationship was from online dating, but didn't work out; haven't really ever met someone through friends). Has anyone been in a similar experience? And does any one have any advice for strategies with coping with feelings of being unlovable, and also ways to meet new people to challenge these thoughts? 
 Any feedback would be greatly appreciated as this is something that I am really struggling with! 
 Cheers, 
 Brooke xx

Hi there, I am seriously struggling. From an early age I was subjected to sexual abuse and through fear and threats I was forced to remain quiet about it for many years. Almost 10 years later, through a member of family whom was also affected by this our story came out, we went to the police and the courts process began and the perpetrator was sentenced to 13 years in prison. This time was emotional for all our family and accordingly we were referred to a counselor in this area of expertise  who I saw on a weekly basis. Counselling seemed to assist over the 2 year period I attended and I found myself needing to go there less, and my willingness to go out and socialize with people and achieve day to day activities gradually started to increase. For the next few years I seemed to be fine, I lost a heap of weight, actually managed to complete my degree and work two cafe jobs and maintain a reasonably stable work/life balance.About mid-way last year I decided to properly pursue my career using the degree I had achieved and in doing so resigned from my cafe job at the time, giving a full months notice and thoroughly explaining that I was doing this for me, to start pursuing the job I had worked so hard for. I had began applying for jobs since I completed my degree in 2013, and throughout 2014. By July I had still heard either nothing or ""no"" from dozens of applied jobs so as a last resort to not do nothing and earn some cash over summer I applied for a job at Aldi. Shocked I received a reply in minutes and was successful in my application.After being accepted though I felt this overwhelming guilt that all who had received my 'searching for my career' info had been deceived and I became embarrassed and withdrawn.This feeling continually ate at me which I ignored as I kept thinking to myself ""a job is a job', but that feeling of worthlessness & not being able to achieve anything higher than a supermarket job caused me to shy away from not only my old work colleagues but friends and family as well.I cry so much and feel constantly down and dissatisfied. Motivation to do daily things that I enjoy such as walking or going out have gone over the past year and now I can not even go out in public without my chest tightening and feeling anxious at how much people will judge me for my past choices and how little I have achieved.I also feel everyone hates me.I actually have no idea how to get back on track as my past habits and current feelings have severely intertwined

Its a good day today, so im saying hello to everyone out there for the first time ever.
i am beryl, i have deep depression, anxiety, ptsd and an eating disorder. I have lots of other physical things wrong too. Ive been depressed for many years and i think it is my normal. Over the years it deepens and recedes in slow cycles. I just cant sort it out. Sometimes i think my life is not so bad, then other times it seems unbearable. My head is a big bowl of water and i balance it so well people dont see the tears as i never spill them with other people. There are no other people, there never has been. But now, after all this time there is all of you out there. Yes, im smiling at you. Maybe, just a tiny maybe, im not completely alone?  Its sad to think there is someone else in this half life. Could we help each other? Is there light at the end of the tunnel?    More importantly i dont think my tunnel has an end. Im so tired of plodding down it. So tired and for what? More of the same. Most of the time im numb, there is no enjoyment at all. I wonder if that realy exists. How does happy feel? What is it?  These days i hardly leave the house. I dont actually want to do anything- thats anything. My mind is so fuzzy i havnt been able to read a book for so many years now. Im like an actor playing the part of my own life. Does anyone realy understand? Or am i in this foggy bubble alone, so alone, for ever? Is there anyone out there?

Hi, 
I'm just wondering if anyone has beaten Melancholic depression without medication ? Or how they manage it without medication ? Though if you do take medication, what are the effects ? I don't really want to take medication,  I am hoping a specific  psychologist could possibly help me instead of numbing myself out completely. I have been battling it since I was 11 and I am now 28, a variety of traumatic experience have occurred throughout my life which have effected my behaviour, mood and trust.  I  never wanted to admit it was actually depression, but the rubber has hit the road, so to speak. 
Both my parents suffer from a mental illness, my mother has paranoia schizophrenia and my dad is bipolar, I thought sharing that may help because I was told Melancholic is genetic,and maybe someone on beyond blue shares a similar story. I also suffer from PTSD, I know everyone is different, but what I  have read on beyond blue I don't suffer it severely, this is all new to me talking about my situation, because growing up we were never allowed to talk about my mums sickness due to the stigma.
My counselor mentioned this website about two months ago, I was abit stand offish at first but then got thinking who better to ask advice then from those who are going through or have experienced a similar illness, 
any suggestions would be appreciated.  


Thanks for your time,
Crystal.

Hi everyone,
Please excuse if this first post I make here is a ramble. Don't know what really to say or ask for.
The best I can describe it as a little black cloud that has reappeared over my head again.
It's not a regular thing, but it appears every once in a blue moon, where I'm down and just want to be shut off from everyone I know. I'm okay to go outside, to the shops (etc), but want to stay clear of people I know.
To explain this latest little black cloud, this weekend was supposed to be a pretty big weekend at our cricket club with our biggest social event of the year, Halloween Night.
During the week I told my teammates I wasn't going to be getting a costume this year (like everyone else) but was still going to DJ their party. There was constant nagging that I needed to get one, so took out one of those pay day loans (I get paid monthly) to get one.
Come yesterday (Halloween), there was other nagging of me of if I made sure everyone had got a lift to the game - I captain a bottom grade side that has a number of juniors playing - while at the same time being nagged to set up my DJ equipment before I head to the game (some 7 hours early).
Someone who said they didn't need a lift changed their mind at the last second, so I was feeling that black cloud roll in.
Get to the ground and the match starts late due to the weather, I forget that we're one short and when one of other sides come to watch (whose game was called off), I get nagged again for not asking them to lend a sub fielder.
These are small naggings but it just feel like a heavy and heavier pressure.
During the course of the day, under this cloud, I forget to collect match payments and now dread I'll be nagged about that.
The final straw was at the end of the game, someone who I caught a lift to the ground with said someone else would give me a list back to our home clubrooms. After I finish all the captain's paperwork, I find no-one left!
I leave a message on our what's app group saying I need and lift and someone suggests I take a taxi, instead of turning back to pick me up - triggering off this little black cloud!
I finally make my way to the clubrooms, grab my hired halloween costume, give everyone a dirty look, live my DJ gear and headed straight home. I switched my phone off for 24 hours and refused to talk to anyone.
What hurts is I took 4 wickets yesterday (my best ever bowling), but never enjoyed it.
Now I fear having to front and communicate with them all at training.

So here is my tale of woe. I'm in my late 30's, single and have zero friends. I have not been in a real relationship since I was 20 years old. I don't know how to relate to people. I make what turns out to be bad decisions that have hurt others around me. I sit at my laptop each night and want to connect to people. I want someone to care about me and tell me that I am worth the effort to visit my house. Even my own family don't even bother. For the last 18 months I have been sliding backwards into a puddle of go. I was passionate about things and felt the fire in my belly. Now I can't even concentrate on something long enough to feel anything. I want to work in an industry that requires empathy but I look at people and feel nothing. Is it always going to be like this ?

I am very new to the forum world am quite frankly this scares me. I have been suffering depression for what seems most of my life with periods of very dark times  followed by some times where I feel I doing ok. I am in a dark place right now and feel so alone. I surround myself with people who have absolutely no idea what is going inside. I just feel sad all the time. I have isolated myself over the last 12 months as I feel paranoid that why would anyone want to be my friend. I have nothing to offer. I over analysis everything and quite frankly I am exhausted feeling this way. I have a family but I have pushed my husband away, I am pretending everything is ok but really itś  not. I hate it, I just feel that everyone hates me.

I have cut back my drinking a lot this year and thought alcohol was the problem, then when I stopped I was still acutely depressed and anxious and am now addressing these issues as well. I have been attending AA meetings for three years (am only 19 days sober, have gotten 5 months but was still very mentally ill and did not realise it), thought because I was not drinking I was anxious/depressed and now realise these actually came before the addiction. Have had gr8 support from lots of AA members, the mental health crisis assessment team at my local hospital and today is my first time on the forums here. Am much better today after waking up in tears again as recently as yesterday and fearing I may have to be hosipitalised (the mental health team have visited in my home). I have only just realised how crippling acute depression and anxiety can be because of the self medicating and addiction, I thought drugs and alcohol alone were my problem. Anyhooo wanted to post this as a thread as I have looked for similar ones and not found anything recent (last was around 2014) and am not familiar with threads or posting so just wanted to touch base and share and get any feedback that may be out there that's more recent. Gr8ful for a good start to my day today, hanging in there after putting the rope over the rafter and chair underneath as recently as 15 or so days ago....so used to self medicating but now nowhere left to run, don't want to do it anymore and am taking positive steps and actually GETTING OUT OF THE HOUSE, WALKING AND TALKING TO PEOPLE :0! I guess y'all no how hard that is when depressed and even worse when you isolate through drinking, it's been decades.
Just wanted to share that, and say hello and put it out there in the cyberverse, don't really understand how it all works....

Today I awoke feeling exhausted again for no reason. This is a familiar feeling, only it has worsened again over the past few months. I know this way of life, I have battled and thought I had won... but it seems that the feeling of rapid heartbeat and quick anger can never truly be forgotten. A simple morning as many other before, my loving partner holding me, the kids being kids as they argue about nothing every morning. 
Then there is me, swirling and churning inside my head. A thousand thoughts colliding and rebounding off one another. I can't hear anything and it feels like I am falling... 
Yes, I remember this daemon. I remember it well.
For years I tried to blast it away, drinking and smoking until sleep finally took me. Then I got clean. Clear, calm and collected. Relaxed. 
Today, for the first time in a long time. Today I feel it on my back again. Crushing the life from me. Was it ever truly gone? How can it be back?
As I look into the loving eyes of my partner, she is always there. Ready to catch me, but how do I tell her about this infection? This metaphorical cancerous entity that has one hand around my heart and whispers destitute into my ears? How do I tell her that I feel this way? Why do I feel this way???
Life is good to me, I work full time, have a partner who loves me and kids that see me as a role model. My family is great. We have always had a roof over our heads and never missed a meal... but this pressure on my head is killing me. I can't go through this again and I do not wish to put them through it either... Emotions never were my strong point, but I feel great love and appreciation for them. Losing them would be like losing my own soul.
If I knew how to ask for help normally, I would. I have tried the tablets, but they fixed nothing. I have tried counselling, again they fixed nothing. This has been fluctuating on and off for the best part of 20 years, I can't go through this again.

Hi! My name is Loz.
I'm a wife to a supporting husband and a mother to two beautiful girls, ironically I feel so alone. The last thing I want to do is burden my family with my thoughts and feelings.
I have been experiencing depression off and on for the last 12 years and I have been on anti depressants and seen physiologists. For a large part of that time, I've been self medicating with alcohol. I know that I can't continue down this path and I need to make a change.
My job is very stressful and there are days that I just want to walk out.I keep pushing myself to carry on and put on that brave face.
I feel somewhat awkward posting this. I'm not one to usually do this sort of thing. I want to be happy again and be the wife and mum that I should be and need to be.

Hi all
i've come to the conclusion that I have very little chance of a full recovery ( only took 6 years for me to admit it).
this came about today with one of the many colourful discussions with my wife who said I've been trying different things for years to cure myself, and maybe it's time to accept the condition and learn how to live with it rather than fight all the time. I feel she right as it takes so much energy to fight and I'm tired I just want to live my life , save my marriage and spend time with my kids.
so my question is when you feel an episode of depression comming what do you do to accept it and get on with your life ? Hopefully it's possible .
also I don't always know when it's going to happen , so can anyone tell me how they know when it's happening ?i also have anxiety Attacks , but i find these easier to deal with 
 
TIA
MR

Hi there, my name is Sollly. I am suffering from depression for 16 years now. But recently i am not sure what i am suffering from. I have lost my way. Only after i moved to Aus with 3 small boys and a wife, working fifo, did i realise that i have no clue what i am doing or even why i am doing this. 
 I constantly think i am not good enough for this work, as i still struggle after 11 months to fit in the role. I have social anxiety and don't make friends easily, i have to concentrate very hard to have a normal conversation with anyone.  English is my second language and therefore it takes time to communicate in a proper manner. 
 I am a pleaser, empath that has followed the main stream too long. I have no identity anymore and we seldom do things because of my constant worries about work and providing for my family. I feel inferior to everyone arround me and that my opinion does not matter. Is work everything? I don't want to fail my children but i can feel my mental health slipping. I am on medication and it keeps me inline but can not get an appointment with a psyciatrist to evaluate its effectiveness. 
I love australia, can not go back to country of birth. Is 35 too late to change your whole career and start at the bottom again? It feels like i am ungreatful for what i have, i should oblige and count my blessings. I just dont see the point anymore. Such a fine line between the rabit hole and euphoria. Some days i am possitive and tackle the world, but get easily discouraged. My self worth and assurance is gone. I was not always like this, i used to be strong.

I know l am depressed. I have never felt lower, more alone and more isolated in my life. I have no family living within 500kmh's of me and then its only an elderly parent with no coping mechanisms of their own. My dog is my constant and only companion. Four years ago my life was at its most content then out of right field a major health crisis left me disabled and with acquired brain injury. After over 18 months scrapping and crawling my way back my partner turned on me. I became homeless and left with virtually nothing. I couldnt afford housing in any form where l was living (unless l gave away the one security and love l knew, my dog) so l took what l did have and moved clean across the country hoping for a new start. I ended up even more isolated  and alone than ever. I cannot cope with people; l find building friendships challenging and maintaining them even harder. l did find some volunteer work that l thought l would enjoy. Then l thought things had really changed and l secured a part time job (ironically in a mental health related field). The employer seemed very empathetic to my abi and disability and the part time hours where to be flexible but after barely 2 months l am going to throw it in. I just cannot cope with it and this now is adding a huge burden on my loss of self esteem, frustration and lack of self worth. As a former professional in my field and with a lot of education and decades of work experience l feel l have hit an even lower point than when l lost my home and what had been a loving long term relationship. I have always managed to have the resilience and resources to find a way back or to break things down to start to find a way back but not now. I feel overwhelmed, emotional, in trying to deal with people l feel its all too much; cognitively l am so overwhelmed l just cannot relate to people or manage any interpersonal relationships.  l feel like l am on another planet that l have nothing in common with people. The day to day challenges of trying to keep up appearances so to speak is getting beyond me. I will not talk to my GP, l do not trust her. Heck, after the wheels fell off 2 years ago l was put on anxiety medication and my current GP is trying to get me off it ! I am running out of characters to explain that. I know l need help but realistically l dont want it ! Its all too much effort and whats it going to do ? Not much in the long run because much of what needs to change cant; l have tried before and ended up back here !

Hi, having depression as you all know brings with it total lack of energy and motivation, can some one out there enlighten me with some coping mechanisms of trying to get through this whether its with medicines or whatever. I am on an antidepressant and 2 weeks in, I know it takes about 4-5 weeks for it to kick in as I have been on another antidepressant which didn't work, I am sick of feeling so tired and run down and with drawing from people and cant be bothered talking.....I walk every morning for 30 mins but that doesn't seem to help but I will keep doing it, thanks I look forward to hearing from someone.

Hi, I'm new to this forum but need some help as I think I am losing the plot.
I have suffered from anxiety and depression for most of my life, but thankfully can usually manage it quite well.  Most days are a struggle in one way or another but I get through them and on the whole have a lot of happiness in my life now.
So why do I lose it sometimes and for no apparent reason lash out verbally at the people I love and care about most?  Does anyone else do this?  It leaves me feeling so unhappy and feeling sick to the bottom of my stomach.
Any comments to help me understand this a bit better would be most welcome, as at the moment I feel like a totally horrible person and hate myself.
Thank you in advance.

I sit here typing this, the quietness of the house is causing ringing in my ears so I had to put the television on to break the silence, the feeling of being alone is all too real. The false side of me today has past. I am exhausted playing a charade. The positive side that I project to others, the motivating me,the up beat me, the confident me, is now asleep. I am alone with my thoughts, and the internal struggles that lay within. I need sleep, yet too scared to go to sleep, and too scared to stay awake. 
Tomorrow is another day, another sunrise, another charade to present to those around me. If only they knew what was going on inside, then again, I wonder if they would even care. It's been years since I have felt any real value. I always try and find something positive in each and every day. The sunshine of my little boys smile, his laughter still bouncing around in my mind's picture. If only I could see him, but alas I have to wait another week for my one day of togetherness, only to have my heart ripped out when I take him back. What a roller coaster my life is. 
My own childhood memories always come flooding back in these quiet times and I often dread the coming of the night. The thoughts of when I was homeless at 14 years old, being assaulted by those you have trusted, living in a park and in the back of a station wagon in a friends back yard, and still finding something, a little anything to keep going. I have always been so good at portraying that positive happy person, even in my darkest hour, hoping that one day I may even convince myself. 
I have sought professional help, even undertaking clinical hypnotherapy over a 12 month period and that seemed to only bring the memories forward and yet provide no real answers. I only seem to get solace when I write poetry and work on my autobiography. I find writing is very therapeutic for me but I have to focus to do it. I can't always focus and that frustrates me. I am hoping by writing on this forum it will allow me refocus and find the will to keep writing.  
I have recently retired from work due to illness, a brand new set of struggles, struggles that I determined to overcome or at least give it my best shot. We get into dark places at times but with each sunrise there is a brand new beginning, and what we chose to do with that beginning is entirely up to us. It is by no means an easy task when depression sets in but we still need to find a way to keep pushing on.

Hi all
 Joined today as am feeling so socially isolated at the moment and long term issues of anxiety, OCD and depression are not helping.
Had a rough year as I separated from my husband in April and have only just managed to keep my head above water since. Also studying full time at uni and not doing as well this year as the previous one which is really frustrating me. Only really have my mum to talk to and nobody else and she can only do so much. My self-esteem has plummeted since the separation and I am realising I have elements of social anxiety which I need to deal with. The lack of a decent social network and studying mostly at home is making me feel so alone and I feel like the walls are closing in sometimes. Also gained a lot of weight over past few years which is now making me feel really unhappy with myself and tired all the time. Just starting to wonder when life will pick up again as it seems like a never-ending series of challenges and no fun at all. Finding it hard to get motivated and do anything positive for myself.
 Thanks for reading and hope to get to know some of you on here.

Ive battled depression and anxiety all my life, from as early as I can remember, so many underlying issues that ive never seeked help for because well how is talking about it going to help or fix it... I developed a drug addiction at an early age and got clean after almost dying and losing everything in my life.. well everything that was important to me. Stayed clean for 2 1/2 years, up until last month...
How could I be so stupid? Its pathetic, how can I let this drug control my life, why cant I stop? What did I do?
I don't want to become who I used to be again - I wont survive

Ok so i will apologize in advance im in a state so this will be a ramble im sure.
I am new to all this suffered for years but finally seeking help and a diagnosis. i have seen couple of different psychiatrists been told that i have ocd by all of them and cant deny that totally agree. the part of my diagnosis i have trouble  with is one phyc told me i have bipolar but other have said no i dont agree with the bi polar i dont have the highs.
 my brother is bi polar so i know a bit about it  i dont think i'm the same. 
the other said panic disorder and depression with the ocd so that brings me to my question could this be right i was told the depression doesn't come and go like my moods do. i can be ok one day and unable to stop crying the next. i am so irratable feel like im going to explode alot of the time. is this normal for depression to be up and down and to be so on edge and frustrated. some days i so exhausted its hard to move and do anything but i'm a mum of 3 so not an option to curl up and hide. other days so anxious and irritated im so fidgety still exhausted and dont have energy but i really restless. I cant keep going like this need to know what is happening i dont know much about depression would really appreciate some advice does this sound like depression. i not on meds i refuse untill someone says for sure whats wrong but im at the point where i need to do something fast im in a state i dont have family support except for my husband no otherfamily to support us havent told my husbands family they not the supportive type i did stupidly tell mine and then heard my mother has been making fun of my ocd issues. ive distanced myself from all friend havent seen them for about 2 years i just shut myself off. i contacted two recently trying to reach out explained a little about whats happening with me but i think its a lost cause cause havent heard back from them even though they said wish they new could have helped ect, i seem to attract people that find me useful not the kind to return the favour. anyway this has turned into a rant thought it would all i wanted to post was like i said does any of this sound like depression mixed in with my ocd?

I am so sick of feeling like sh..! I have been on every antidepressant under the sun for the last 16 years and nothing works. I have moved to a new area now with a gorgeous house by the beach a pool I don't have to work can stay at home(big part of the problem I think) and I feel completely dead inside. I am 46 years old. Life is wasting away I want to enjoy everything around me and I cant. I go for a walk along the beach with my dog thinking this will help everyone says exercise helps and the whole time im walking im thinking is it too soon to turn around id rather be home with a coffee and a menthol cigarette, ill go a bit further. 
I went to Mental Health yesterday and they want me to come off all meds and try cognitive therapy with a Psychologist. It would make sense as they haven't worked for 16 years why poison myself and still feel crappy???? I am okay when im with people which is interesting. I went to a birthday party Saturday and had a great time chatting to all the adults and felt on a kind of high when I left like yes that's how I want to feel again every day. I'm naturally bubbly and funny without sounding too modest but I am and I have this horrible illness that is taking it away from me. My old GP told me he linked depression to loneliness as in studies around the world certain countries have literally no depression like The Philippines as they are surrounded by family all day long.I know I need to get a job but im a Teachers Aid and it is soooo boring and dull. I love the kids but I want something to lift me up where ill be chatting with people all day long like shop work or something. I need to get our of the house that's for sure. 
Anyway I feel better from just writing this down even so thanks x

Hi,
 I am wondering if there is anyone that suffers from depression and gets similar symptoms to the ones that I have - and how you can control them so that I am able to function at work and in public properly and I can return to feeling normal again (especially dealing with constant crying) These get worse when i let my anxiety get really bad and I tend to fall into a depressed state shortly after. 
Symptoms:
Crying constantly, in public and alone - I get episodes where I can cry for up to 7 hours straight - at this point I will probably start hitting my head against the wall because I feel like I have gone crazy
Breathing difficulty 
Trouble concentrating 
Everything makes me feel guilty
There is no point to anything I do in life!
It takes too much effort to do simple things - they feel so difficult.
Nightmares
Feeling tired and lazy
Basically, I have no idea why i am feeling so sad all the time. Everything i think of even happy memories makes me feel so sad. I think it has something to do with my perfectionism and being too self reliant i deal with everything on my own and bottle everything inside. I have struggled since I was about 16 years old. Each but gets worse as the years pass. I never spoke to my parents or anyone about the constant pain I was feeling. And now my body doesn't know how to handle it anymore. I am on medication and seeing a therapist. Medication seems to help the best.  I also encourage that if anyone else does not know what to do or if u feel like you are crazy or abnormal you are not. And you are not alone. Talking to someone has been the best thing. Don't bottle up and hide from the world. Seeing a doctor and my medication is the one thing seeing me through this episode.

Hey everyone,
My name is Bob and I think I suffer from depression. This is my first post because seriously, I have no idea what I am doing. I cant seem to focus on my own happiness and it cuts my wound deeper when I see others move on and easily manage themselves (especially an ex partner). I'm afraid I cant be strong enough, because everything is just going from bad to worse. I have forgotten how to be happy and I wish I could find it again. I know what I am probably saying is silly but I don't want to fall in love ever again. the pain feels so heavy and I feel really lonely. Sometimes I wish I could pop my brain out of my head and wash it. and disconnect any attachments to the heart. I'm currently studying and its just distracting my life. If anyone knows a method that helps them that could possibly help me, I would really appreciate it. ill even buy you a coffee or something. However, knowing I'm not the only one feeling this gives me a bit of courage to do something you know? 
Anyways I hope everyone is on the road to recovery and I'd be more than happy to help anyone else out there.
Bob

I'm in my 50's & have suffered from depression since childhood. My illness has seriously  impacted on my ability to manage my affairs,particularly financially. I have lived in rental accommodation  since arriving in arriving  in Melbourne  over 10 years ago. In April, the job I had held for over 10 years was made redundant. 8 of my colleagues were also  made redundant. I was very angry about being forced to leave  the organisation in this as it was very clear that the nature of my role & its value to the organisation had not been  properly assessed or understood. I have had several months of casual & contract work since April.  I sufficient funds (just) to purchase a very modest apartment, but have not been able to proceed due to my uncertain situation. I was recently hospitalised for depression & discharged just over a week ago. I felt considerably better while on hospital but have relapsed since my discharge.   I live alone & am desperately lonely.  I am in desperate  need of a support group &  mentor to assist my decision-making

I've visited this forum from time to time when I'm feeling down but this is the first time it's felt so bad that I thought maybe I should post something. I'm 28, male, Software Engineer by trade and living alone in an apartment in East Melbourne and never had a girlfriend in my life and it's completely destroying me at the moment having nobody in my life for companionship. I've been sitting here for 10 minutes trying to think how to even start to explain my problems but I think I'll just recap briefly up to this point.
I feel like I was a normal kid up until about the age of 14 or 15 when suddenly I just stopped wanting to go out, I'd avoid my friends requests to hang out with made up excuses and the times I couldn't escape going out I'd be filled with anxiety and unable to enjoy myself. Then at age 16 my father died of lung cancer which was devastating for both me, my mother and my sister so from that point on I didn't have any male role models in my life. The following year my grandfather died (mother's side) so as you can imagine my mother was not in a great place mentally herself, after I graduated year 12 I started playing 'World of Warcraft' and doing virtually nothing else.
'World of Warcraft' was my life for about 6 or 7 years and it was not a healthy habit in the slightest, my anxiety issues worsened along with depression until it got to a breaking point where my mother sent me to see a psychiatrist for a year because I vomited from anxiety of something as basic as going to get my haircut. I slowly worked through my anxiety issues and eventually was able to leave the house again without turning into a train wreck, then came my mothers new boyfriend. Things seemed fine at first but then he'd just snap at me some days and call me things like ""worthless"", ""lazy"" and ""not a real man"" (because I didn't like drinking or going to pubs) so this did wonders for my already low self esteem, my mother would defend me but in the end she'd still keep him around. 
To quickly sum up the next few years I ended up going to Uni and walking straight out of Uni into a job, I moved out of home and now I sit alone in an apartment every night wishing I could just find a woman I can relate to or connect with. Every year I lose hope that I'll ever find that someone and I'm starting to seriously question if I'll even make it to 30, I took Tuesday off as an example because I couldn't get myself out of bed.
Can anyone tell me why I'm failing at life so badly?

Dear Forum, 
Desperately hoping that someone here might have an idea of where to point me to ...
 I've kinda suffered with anxiety and mild depression for a number of years, but I recently started a new job 6 months ago, and 3 months into is I had a stroke and was hospitalized + off work for a total of 6 weeks and a bit. 
I went back to work too early I think and this has ended up with me having a total mental meltdown and admitted to clinic.  My GP seems to agree but it looks like it could be a real grey area. 
I'm expecting to be in the clinic for quite a while and off work for a minimum of 3 months according to my psychiatrist.
 Money is real tight as I didnt get paid for the first 6 weeks I was off due to almost no personal leave accrued. 
I have so many questions, but the entire thought of having to battle ""the system"" is just sending me into a complete flat spin even with the nice meds that they have got me on - I just dont know where to turn. 
 
i) I have 3 super funds, all have some kind of income protection as far as I can gather
ii) Would the current mental episode me a seperate event to the stroke? IE would I have to make 2 claims and a second 6 week waiting period now for the mental health?
iii) How would the kinda referee process work, because I know that they will all be trying to make each other pay, so have no ideas even which one i shoulkd contact first? maybe the fund I have had the longest?
iv) Any ideas how I can get help to ""cope"" with all of this process? I'm in a expensive private clinic and no one here seems to have a clue. Even the psychiatrist said ""maybe you should just call your super fund and see what they say"" -- OK, so I'm not going to get any help on that from the clinic. You would have thought that kind of support would be really high on the agenda. Amazing really
v) If you are off work for 6 weeks, anyone know if they backdate it to the first day you stopped getting paid?
Its driving me even more nuts that I already am with sick worry. 
If anyone can help me out you would be doing me and my family a huge huge service. 
Thanks :)
Fuzzy

I have been in a really bad headspace lately and I've finally come to the realization that I need help. I asked my husband to take the morning off work to watch our youngest daughter so I can go to the doctor. The thoughts I have been having I just hate myself even more for even thinking them. I have been feeling like a complete and utter failure in everything that I've been doing. I'm restless, exhausted and miserable. I know I need help and I just don't know what else to do. I've never been big on opening up to anyone so making my doctor see that I'm depressed is going to be very hard for me but I can't hide it anymore.

First time trying anything like this, ive tried psychs, they didnt help cause i would hide to much, and i have the mentality, if you cant spot it, you dont deserve to know, stupid, i know.
 
Pretty much i got depression a year or two ago, i dont know, i wouldn't acknowledge it, cause i was always happy an optimistic, nothing could bring me down, then i got sick with glandular fever, and it all started going down hill, i lost my health, i lost my job from that, and it eventually lead to me loosing my fiancee, took about another 6 months after all that to acknowledge i had anything wrong, i was down , didnt want to do anything, but a friend eventually got through to me, currently trying diffrent medications, and nothing seams to work, when i feel like things might be starting to get better, i just get kicked back to the ground and it feels like im starting all over again, the worst thing is i dont have my family as support, 'just do something blah blah blah, they might think it helps but it dosnt. i just constantly feel like shit and it just feels like everything is always getting worse, i just want to genuienly smile, and get excited for something again, anything.

How do you cope with being told you have depression for life. You will have times where the depression will be managable but it will not stay that way.  You will have bouts of depression, it will always be like this.
I felt like someone had slapped me.  I have been told this before but it sank in yesterday.  Both my psychiatrist and my psychologist have said I have depression for life but I always thought I would beat it.  Isn't that why I am in therapy.
I feel like all hope is lost, I do my best well actually I try really hard to put into practice what my therapist say to do, and i was told yesterday I have worked extremely hard with the psychologist this year but that felt like a waste of time.
I am not ready to throw in the towel but it makes it hard when you are told you will be up and down for the rest of your life.  Extremely hard.

I feel like I genuinely have the shittest life ever. I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder- which means I have schizophrenia and severe depression at the same time, post traumatic stress disorder and body dysmorphic disorder. I look around at everyone else with their easy lives and hear them complain about the most trivial things. I'm 27 and live at home with my parents. I love them but my dad has an abusive past with my sister and I and he stills yells at me in a very vicious manner. My mum is highly judgemental and easily holds grudges with me and is obsessed with cleanliness and order. I am in love with my male best friend but he only loves me as a friend. I am extremely paranoid and suspicious of others and can't relax when I'm around other people. I have been severely depressed for three years and it never ever goes away. I had a significant delusion that I was deformed and the ugliest person in the world that lasted for an exhausting and paralysing 10 years. I believed my looks was causing all the bad things happening in the world and that people were offended and angered by my appearance. I turned away job opportunities, love interests, study opportunities and social events because I believed God was telling me to. I even stopped talking and eating for a few years due to messages from 'God'. The funny thing is I am so strong and work full-time at a bank, go gym every morning, am a really good friend and relative. This doesn't suit the life I've lived and how horrible I feel every second of the day. People like me usually end up being drug addicts, in jail or unemployed. I don't want to be a part of a society in which I don't fit in. Everyone around me has had it so easy. Losing their minds over breakups, not being skinny enough, not having the latest gadgets. Welcome to my life.

To start, assume ive done at least a moderate amount of research. Also while i know i have bouts of depression that add or possibly cause these ""events"" it is the events themselves i want to know about. They can happen anytime but always start in the morning and can persist, happening once to twice an hour for the rest of the day. There is NO specific trigger. They can start mid laugh or cry. Tired or awake. Happy or sad. It starts by a wave of feelings very out of place but feel familiar. Like recall of an event that never happened. Kinda sad kinda anxious kinda lovelorn. Indescribable really. Then my heartrate increases and i sweat. I feel short of breath. All the while those ""feelings"" wash over me. The entire even lasts less than a minute. Not all the time but usually after the first they reoccur throughout the day getting slightly worse then better before dissappearing before bed. Ive done my research. These are NoT panic attacks or mini heart attacks or anxiety. There is NO specific trigger. I hope someone has a good idea or has similar expiriences so i can get some answers. Thank you.

Hello to whoever is reading this, i hope you are well.
So yesterday I had two appointments, one for Centrelink to get a job capacity assessment done and one at my Job Provider. The Centrelink one went well, she said she would write up the report and I would most likely get referred to a Disability support Job Provider. I then went to the Job Provider and found out I was not seeing the girl I usually saw. This other lady asked what I was doing... studying certificate II animal studies and volunteer at the animal shelter, which my psychologist suggested for me and helped me be able to go. She went on to say that for the ""work for the dole"" I had to study a Certificate III or higher so what wasnt good enough and then the animal shelter volunteering was not an approved activity so I would have to do something else. Well of course my anxiety shot through the roof and I burst into tears in front of her. I struggled to get the words out that I went to Centrelink that morning and to look up for my report. She got on the phone to someone saying she had a client in front of her who was very tender and falling to pieces... which of course made me feel even more shit.... and then she finally found the report and saw ""severe anxiety/depression. extreme emotions, tearfulness, freezes when anxious and struggles to talk..""
etc. She said Oh I dont feel so bad now I mean I can be mean but not today. Anyway she wrote up the referral for the Disability support Job Provider which I have an appointment for on Friday. I just hope these people will actually help me and not just push me to the side and stress me out. 
Anyway now I'm just feeling quite down about everything and the future. I know I have a family who loves me and a caring boyfriend but still the black dog keeps pulling me down making me feel all alone and whats the point because I'll never get better from this, its just going to be a constant struggle.
thanks for reading.

Hello fellowship, I am new on here so i appreciate your patience in advance.
I was diagnosed with post natal depression at 18, and from time to time I have felt I recovered, medicated and un medicated.
What I now understand is the black dog is still there, it never goes away for me.
I have many issues at present and am reaching out to see if others are having similar experiences, and how they cope with life.
My issues at present are a list as long as your arm, from relationship, going for a big promotion at work, to my father who's in a nursing home and is sad all the time(he cries on the phone most times I talk to him), to my children whom I hardly see, my sons GF hates me so I can't even call him,  a partner who is controlling and not supportive(although he would tell you otherwise), I have major surgery coming up, the house I rent is up for sale as of today, a have employees who push my buttons, I feel alone, I have a constant sensation of drowning, I suffer with fibromyalgia, my mother does not speak to me nor does my aunt, I only have my dad and my children. I have friends, but I feel like I'm a burden to them and am scared to ask for help, I feel I always help them(which is ok). I've received treatment in the past which worked short term, but the black dog still comes back. I'm struggling to cope. 😢  I've had huge weight gain, 30kg, which is something else that causes me irrational thoughts.
If anyone has any suggestions on how I feel better about myself, I would love to hear from you.
Even to just be a friend, who can understand. 
Thanks so much for reading my post.

Hi my name is Annabelle
This is my first time on here. I'm sitting up in bed typing this as I have looked up 100s of tactics online to get to sleep with the way I'm feeling but no luck. 
I am a naturally outgoing, confident person socially. I dedicated my life to fitness last year joined a gym where it was very tight not community and felt a had a purpose in life. Before this time I had depression (episodes of it throughout the year). Once I found a purpose nothing could stop me. I was in my last year of uni and wanted to become a therapist once I graduated. I worked as a disability carer and felt like the world was my oyster. I had friends around me, I was happy and positive and ready for anything.
 This year rolled around. I started becoming obsessive over my body. Lost a guy I was Marley in love with you never really loved me back. Started tormenting myself about my weight gain. Couldn't get a graduate job and keep receiving the same comments for my interviews. Still work as a carer and feel overqualified and useless.
My social circle has diminished into two close friends. I dread the weekend as I don't have anyone to do anything with. I sleep till midday on the weekends and when I don't have work I will sleep most of the day through. 
I have tried getting new trainers, applying for more jobs, seeing a psychologist, changing my medications, trying to figure out how to meet people, reaching out to old friends (who have moved on and have their own friends and are happy).
 I'm sad because I feel like no one wants or cares about me. I don't know how to meet people except for saving up and traveling (which I am doing).
Sorry for the rant but I just wanted to see if anyone else has these issues. 
I look like a social person yet spend my weekends all alone.
 I feel useless, no one cares I have nothing to show for everyone is traveling and enjoying their life while I'm in a rut.
i want to enjoy my life and it's so hard to look up and be positive about it all.
iv started binging on food and doing drugs here and there to elevate my mood bust in the end I'm all alone.

Some people are triggered to depression through guilt.         event --> guilt --> depression and remorse
What do you feel guilty about but still seem to do or wish you hadn't done?

Hey guys, 
 I am 28 years old and feel like I am stuck in a rut, and it is really worrying me. 
I have depression and anxiety, and it has been getting worse over the last few weeks, and I feel like I have hit my limit. 
I feel very forgotten about among my friends. I reached out to a friend (which I am not good at) and told her that I needed some help, and yet I haven't heard back from her in over  a week. 
I keep putting on weight because when I am depressed I eat crappy food, almost as a punishment to myself. I don't even like it, I just feel like that's all I deserve (does anyone else struggle with this...Would LOVE some help with managing this). 
I am quite in debt and whilst overtime is available in my job (which would get rid of my debt very quickly) I don't like my job as I feel very invisible and unappreciated. I get anxious just thinking about going to work. So instead of working overtime and getting money, I often don't work because I am too anxious to get there. 
The other day my car was broken into, by having the window smashed, and I feel like that has tipped me over the edge. 
I know constantly feel anxious, my arms and legs feel really heavy/weighted down and my mind is so incredibly foggy. I have never experienced it to this degree before. I have trouble driving, holding conversations and working, all because my mind feels so clouded over. 
 
I have a really supportive family, but I still feel like I am just suffocating and everything is becoming blurry. 
Any and all advice is welcome ... I really cannot bear to feel like this anymore. I am living my life through a constant haze.

Hi  I have been married 15.5 years and been diagnosed with depression & anxiety for 5 years.i took anti depressants for the 1st 3 years and have been trying to kick them for the last 2 yearsi use a CPAP for sleep apnea it has taken me 5 years and therapy ( with and without my wife) to finally pluck up the courage to talk to my wife and tell how this illness affects me , I find it hard to open up and do not like to anyone. After several hard conversations I told my wife I need her to show me affection kiss and hugs and to ask me if I'm ok when we are alone and we can talk ( she asks me in front of people) and just to listen and I would aim to tell her the truth about how I really feel even tho saying it out loud makes me sound perfetic ...The 1st day I sat down and started telling he how I felt it was good she listen and made a couple of comments.. After a week and a couple of conversation still no affection and the listing stopped it turn more into tit for tat conversations, this sent me into a 4 day down period , when this issues came to ahead its turns out that my wife says she can't show me affection as she has been so hurt by me the last 5 years she can't suddenly start showing affection and she also wants to voice how this illness affects her ( which I get but I can't just deal with that right now) she wants to stay together and work through it, but she needs normality to show me affectionnow I'm in a very dark place, I thought I would say what I needed and she would help and listen but now I have all these things I have to fix and its overloaded me I have not been able to talk to her for 3 days ( and when we have its been angry words) I'm not suicidal yet but I'm starting to spiral down I just don't cope with multiple problems and when someone has an issue with me I feel I have to fix it , self help book, stop drinking  im thinking of leaving but I don't want to lose my kids or my wife but I'm to angry to think straight , I put my heart on my sleeve and it feels as though it been stamped on. has anyone has a similar situation? MR

I have taken many online depression tests and all came back with results stating I havesevere depression.
I read about depression, the symptoms, the feelings, everything, and I am in shock at how closely it describes everything about me.
I know I have had depression for many years and yet I am still in denial.
I could go on forever, but I want to keep this short.

So i've been talking to someone i wronged while being depressed and its been hard to hear the truths that they wanted to cut me off and how my actions hurt them. how can i recover from this criticism that depression makes cut even deeper. i know they are right but i'm also sorry for myself because I didn't ask for depression either. its not fun being me and i don't get a break from being with me either. i don't think people with happy lives, filled with happy families, the love of a partner, the joy of a new child can know how lonely depression is.  how hard it is to keep your chin up when you are empty, lonely and so sad inside. finding some strength to make it through every day on the hope of a better tomorrow. I feel like an unrecoverable distance now sits between us and wishing won't make it go away.  Just another in a long list of losts in a life that i don't want but have to endure.  I'm getting help but it doesn't turn on a dime. i'm taking my meds and trying to forgive myself but right now, i just want to cry and give myself a hug and say its ok. tomorrow will be better, you just need to make it through the night.

I normally am not the most level headed person anyway but lately I feel like I get really angry and defensive over nothing. Things that never used to bother me now bother me greatly. I am always snappy or snarky with my friends and those around me. They have started saying ""oh no don't bring out angry Katherine"" when they see me getting annoyed. They would have never said that before because I wouldn't have been annoyed in the first place.
 Whenever I'm angry I can feel the tears welling up as well. Normally after I get really angry I go off and have a big cry alone. When I cry I feel like the world is ending.
 I don't even want to be around my friends and family because I think I'm not a nice person to be around and I want to save them the pain of being in my company. 
 I think thesee feelings have been caused by a very stressful time at work and some major life changes.
 I just want to know if anyone else ever feels like this or if they have any tips on how to deal with these feelings. I want to know if the feelings can go away or if I'm stuck feeling like a crazy person forever.
 Thanks heaps

I just want to vent here, because I know you will all understand, as opposed to whining to family and friends who are probably sick of hearing it.
As I said in another post, I had an epiphany the other week, and decided I wanted to be a mental health worker. I haven't worked for ten years, or studied for 20. I planned to do an online course, to be able to cater around my children and my mental health needs. So I planned to do something easy to start, and found an introductory mental health and AOD course online via TAFE. So I enrolles, paid, gets to start date - no confirmation email. I chase them up, and the course was cancelled because I was the only one enrolled. So then I had to fill in a bunch of forms to get my money back. They said they would offer it again in February (although the same scenario could happen again). I was soooo motivated, I decide instead to do Cert 4 in Mental Health via OTEN. I get ready to enrol, only to find the course is being revised. So I speak to the consultant, who says it will be available in February, or there is a diploma course starting November which they've removed the pre-requisites from. So I decide I'll do the diploma. I do more research into it, and as eager as I was, decided it might be too much at once, and I will wait till February for the Cert 4. So this let me down as I really want to start studying now. So then I decide while waiting, I will source out organisations that I could possibly do work placement with. I am in a regional area, so while there are some places, there are not a lot. Out of all the ones I've contacted, I've had two replies, both of who can't take work placement. I haven't heard from anyone else. I don't want to start a course that is costing me over $3000 that I won't be able to complete, because minimum 80 hours work placement is compulsory. Then I email OTEN to see if they could help with ideas for work placement, and they tell me they don't know if they are even offering that course in February, even though my consultant said he'd received confirmation. So now I'm feeling really down and stressed because I want this so much, and you all know how hard it can be to actually really want something and be excited about it. I'm stressed as I bought myself a laptop on sale and even some folders and notebooks in preparation for the course. I'm obsessively checking my emails and feeling let down when there is none from the organisations. I've just about lost my enthusiasm and motivation now.

I have been depressed now for 3years and its not getting any better, I fall back into the same patterns, my relationship has fallen apart and I have lost my sons to my partner. My relationship was very toxic I played the working single mother role for a long time and sat back and watched my partner constantly live a single life go out and party, he was never home. He would constantly come in and out of my life, destroying me every single time i built myself back up. This has been on going for the past 3 years. I lost my job aswell from depression and for the past 3 years i have not been able to hold a job down. I start work and then i am instantly affraid, my body feels like it goes into deffence mode and drains all of my energy. The next day i cant bring myself to go back and i quit even knowing that i am going to go without food for a week because i have no money. I am homeless, alone, without my children and no support. I am at rock bottom and i cant see the light at the end of the tunnel.​

Hi everyone, bit hard for me to discuss this and haven't told anyone but thought I would start here.
i don't if it's depression, anxiety or loneliness but I'm 37 next week with a wife and two great kids but for some reason I'm so unhappy. I don't seem have friends, friends that call or I call, friends that I can count on and can't seem to make friends. I often think friends at my age don't exist, only acquaintances.
im on the verge of quitting my job because I hate it and I don't know what to do next as a career and often stay up till 1 to 2 am to try and sleep. Don't know what category I fit in but feel like the world hates me and I hate it.
sometimes I think I'm being over the top, but how can I feel so alone yet I'm surrounded by my wife and kids. Is that enough? I sometimes think talking to someone but feel embarrassed as I don't think my problems are no where near as bad as others but I don't know where to start.
thanks

Hi everyone, 
I joined the online forum a few days ago and posted in the anxiety section. I'm just trying a new medicine these last 4 days and finding my anxiety is less but now I'm feeling very depressed and down. Maybe because of the weather, or cause my mate (who is always up for a good yarn) had an off day, or cause I'm not really comfortable with my GP, not sure the reason why I'm so down. Normally i suffer from anxiety mostly with a bit of depression, now its quite a lot of depression. I did meet my support worker today and we had a good chat for an hour and a half but the rest of the day I just felt really down. My family does all the unhelpful things like avoiding me when i need to feel people around me and say things like ""keep busy"" which doesnt help.
 
I guess other people have or are going through something similar and I know it can take several weeks for a medication to work also but would be interesting to hear if others are going through this and what strategies they use (I have some already, the weather really fouled up everything today but that's another story).

As soon as I think about it, everything seizes up and I can't find the words and I just end up crying until I can calm myself back down again, stuff it all away behind the mask that I live behind and get back on with the everyday stuff. I can usually pretend nothing is wrong until something happens to crack my facade. Today it is a sore back. Other days it's emotional stuff. I never actually swing into severe depression, it's just an underlying low mood feeling that runs just below the surface. I think it's called dysthymia but I've never been to a doctor about it. I know I should do something about this state of being, but I am scared of change, and I don't have the strength of character to make the effort. It feels like too hard work. It's so much easier just to bury myself in a book or watch a show than to actually think about things. But I know I'm not doing myself any favours and my kids and husband need me to be better.

Not sure if there is anyone in the same boat as me but here goes my story. I am 30yo gay male moved here from interstate in January this year. I tried socializing and staying active which was great. But then I had alopecia and lost confidence and just felt so sad about myself.I took some time off from work and went traveling and felt great. But few days ago depression came back and I am back to square one. I just cant handle this anymore, it feels so exhausting and draining. I'd really appreciate if people would share their side of the story or give me any suggestions. I just want to feel happy and normal. Cheers

Seeing psych every week and back to the doc to change medication tomorrow. Even on a higher dose this one isn't working. Unfortunately those deepest fears are true, people you think are close don't really care if you shut down and give up your personality, that spark that makes you who you are, as long as you don't appear upset. They'd rather you wear the mask than be who you are, worts and all even with depression. It's like that quote from Robin Williams, All it takes is a beautiful fake smile to hide an injured soul and they will never notice how broken you really are. I have four people who actually care but is that enough to build a life on. I don't think it's enough to try getting through these bad times. Cried in the morning, held it together at work, cried all the way home and some more once I got there. My trigger at the moment is seeing someone I may have wronged when this latest depression hit but I'm saddened that although my actions were from being unwell their actions are made from the position of being stable, a 'normal' person. Like most depressed people inwardly fearing there is nothing about you to like/love/care today I've had it confirmed that they are choosing to avoid me. While I understand that, I don't like it and I thought I meant more to them as a friend. I can't seem to let this go and accept that just because I cared, doesn't mean they did or had to. My psych has told me I avoid emotion which is understandable after a long stretch of being chronically depressed and while being well for a bit I tried to open a little and let some people in but I wish I hadn't. Let your guard down, give them a chance to hurt you and they will. The worst is the lack of sleep, knowing you'll have a long night ahead, the emptiness and feeling trapped in a life that you have to keep living. If I had emotion removed I could make it. My folks would be ok, I'd physically be here, I'd be able to survive cause I wouldn't feel and the person who is the real me would finally get to rest. I'm not suicidal, I don't have that option. I've battled this disease for almost 30 years and can be proud how hard I've fought. Only those with major depression know just how hard. It feels like asking someone to go one more round of excruciating pain for what, another flat line period of time until the next depression. I'm so sad, I'm so broken and its a long time till tomorrow night till my Doc might be able to give me a different pill that helps.

Have been feeling much better lately.
then today, just woke up and feel anxious and depressed for no reason.
I just want someone to tell me it'll be ok (and mean it). The thought of this happening for the rest of my life is unbearable.

Hello everyone I recently started a journal about living with my depression and anxiety. I was a little ashamed of it, and considered deleting it, but a friend of mine who is a psychiatrist suggested sharing it here. I was going to paste the whole post here but it's too long and I'm not able to so only the opening is below. I really hope that I can work through my own problems while helping others to understand that they are not alone, so I'm happy for anyone to share this content with friends who might be suffering depression but don't want to be involved in the forum personally. ----Hello, World.I decided to start this blog, because today it took me 8 hours and 19 minutes from the time I woke up to drag myself out of the house and go for a walk. 8 hours. And 19 minutes.Last night, I’d jokingly said to my partner that my intentions today were to go for a run, but who knew how that was going to go! In the morning, the joke became self-mocking reality as I dragged myself out of bed with my feet seemingly encased in invisible concrete blocks.A weak voice flitted through my head stating that I should go for a walk straight away so the rest of my day would get a productivity boost, and maybe I could even go for two today since I had time! Instead I found myself seated in front of my computer, hating myself a little more as every minute passed, and with every ounce of hatred the effort required grew and grew until simply putting on clothes and walking outside seemed like an impossible task.“Life is OK, I guess”I’m sure, if you’re reading this, you’ve had days like this too. And maybe, like me, you don’t feel entitled to even feel this way.I just want to state, candidly, that I have nothing to complain about. From outward appearances, I am a well-educated, reasonably successful, middle-class first-world citizen. I have a full time management-level job, went to a good high school, have a tertiary education, a roof over my head, a nice car, and enough food to get a little bit fat. I have good friends, and family and a partner who love me.To the outside eye,  I have nothing much to complain about... and don’t seem to exhibit any symptoms of being depressed. Anxiety is probably a little more obvious... But the fact that I have nothing to complain about just makes me all the more self critical. I don’t deserve to be unhappy.

Dear friends, I've been around this forum for over 2 yrs now & I've noticed a thought pattern similar to each person experiencing depression. I'm going to generalize so please don't take these symptoms as common to all of us. Nor am I medically trained. Just thoughts from me as a forum regular.I've noticed many of us--Have high self expectations &/or perfectionism-often feel like a failure with low self esteem, lack of confidence-highly sensitive & fear criticism-struggle with diagnosis & treatment options whilst feeling ""weak"" as a person for having this illness-often isolate ourselves as we feel Noone could understand-experience anxiety as a precursor or as part of their depression-fear other people's reactions at a time we are highly vulnerable-blame ourselves for not being able to ""get on with it""- set ourselves unrealistic high self expectations about what we ""should do"" despite our illness requiring us to slow down & let go of some pressures or triggers-feel unable to talk openly to those close to us-feel alone & isolated- have personal stigma ie struggle to accept depression as an illness-fear things will never improve-need a sense of hope & the ability to limit thinking to short term as we often fear & generalize about things that may never happen-can lack insight when very low & experiencing suicidal thoughts. It's not our lives we want to destroy but rather the pain & thoughts we are experiencing-struggle with doing things that would usually be simple tasks-feel the fight/flight response heightened-want to be supported but feel too vulnerable so stay isolated. May fear going out or doing daily tasks-wear a ""mask"" when around others-generally feel exhausted, lacking hope & battles to get through each day.One other common thread amongst the stories on here is that many if not most people have experienced some forms of a traumatic, upsetting or certain life situation that could be seen as a precursor to depression. I'm sure there's other common symtoms the ones above are just straight from my thoughts without any research etc- thoughts I feel common on the forum. So if you relate to any your not alone.Lve Mares

I became depressed around a month ago. Working night shift and getting as little as 4 hours sleep in 3 days bought my repressed subconscious thoughts from years ago to the surface. The love of my life who left me, left me feeling gutted. It doesn't matter that she ticked most of the traits of a sociopath, I adored her, l always will. This coupled with being now years later middle aged and realizing that l have very little and have wasted years. 
Not addressing asocial behavior years ago has it's cost. The depression is ridable, it's not the first time, I know not to throw in your job. The freight train in the face for what I have wasted is stunning. Youth, time to develop, experience life, really enjoy life and stack bricks financially for comfort in older age.. wasted.
It's been an interesting month. All these emotions awakened. Where I was cutting out drinking, I have been drinking heavily just to get to the next day, thats ok, whatever it takes. When I thought I was finally coming out the other side, I wasn't. I started researching how to gas myself in my car. 
 Now I don't know if this roller coaster is slowing or not but I know when it does I have to change things. Falling back into a semi depressed comfort zone is toxic. Depression can be  a wake up call, almost a rebirth, thats great except we retain our negative thoughts, our subconscious to haunt our dreams and impede our future. 
 One help I found is the Internet, there are guides for everything including videos, articles for say positive thinking. I've started, it feels like a foreign language but if even a little sinks in thats good. I no longer want to feel like a reactionary victim. I hope someone gets some worth out of my post.

I'm lost. I found myself googling the phrase ""what to do when you don't know what to do"" and arrived on a forum post here. 
 Nothing seems to be great at present and I am finding myself spending every waking moment thinking about well everything. I can't seem to get my mind to stop thinking. It's an odd feeling, thinking about what to have for lunch and end up asking myself why I haven't gone anywhere in life. Wondering to myself what's holding me back. Feeling worthless and ashamed. 
I have had bouts of depression in the past that have usually been triggered by an event of some kind. This feels different I'm not sad, I'm not angry... I just don't know. My partner often asks me what's wrong, why are you in such a bad mood and that is my answer "" I don't know"". I can't describe how I feel. Writing this is the closest I've come to being able to pen my emotions.
Nothing in my life is worth being depressed over. I live a very privileged life. TrAvel a lot, do very little work, enjoy all of the finer things yet here I am.
i don't know what I'm looking for here. I just thought I'd would try to say how I am feeling.
kind regards

I am so tired of the roller coaster that is depression and I am sure I am not alone in this.
I have been working off and on with a psychiatrist for 20+ and at the begining of the year I agreed to work with a psychologist as well. My shrink and i felt I was stuck and no matter what we did nothing would shift it.
So I have been seeing this psychologist every fortnight and touching base with my shrink every other fortinght. We all felt I was making progress with the different apporach that the psychologist has taken.  I spent 10 days last month interstate staying with a cousin and had a terrific time came back about a week ago and have sunk to new lows.
Why what went wrong.
My shrink said people often are down after a holiday but I am more than down, back to old thought patterns, feel teary and lost.  Dissappointed that I have gone back down agian.  Yes I have a lot on my plate but that doesn't explain it.  I had a lot on my plate before when I was feeling better.
Does it ever end.  The psychologist says the depression will be with me for life and I just have to learn to manage it. That doesn't make me feel very hopefull for a better frame of mind either.

I wrote a goodbye to a friend today knowing I'd never give it to them.I couldn't alter the actions of those last days or explain the thought patterns that seemed valid at the time.That cruelly caused me to react with emotion.I’m grateful I was able to keep my emotions contained for the entire last day in their presence, even when faced with the smiles of their child.  A glimmer of hope that in such innocence, surely there was truth.But I managed to push that away and resist the urge to hold their beautiful child lest my dark shadow block their light. I don’t blame them for the distance that now exists between us.I let the illusion go freely that we were friends or that I was important in their life.I was not strong enough to contain my emotions or reactions at the time and wishing won’t allow me to erase those days.They will define me.I will be remembered for them.I have learnt the lesson not to voice my inner thoughts or outwardly display my inner emotion other than on this forum.I have found it particularly difficult this time around and am deeply disappointed in myself and I now know I may not make it back to the person I was trying to be before.I feel the pull of my old ways of thinking and choose to bury that side of myself as deeply as possible and return to detachment.I survived for a long time that way, having to fight for each day.Depression is always near if not actively stripping from me any joy I could know. So for now I’ll slip back on my mask and play the part that allows those around me to be at ease, ignorant of my daily torment.I will avoid shows of kindness that break down my walls and allow tears to flow; an echo of the hope that I can no longerentertain.I don’t want to feel remorse, guilt, confused or hurt.I will take every word, expression or actionat face value ensuring my interactions are limited to polite indifference.Expecting no more I will be able to smile if I pass you in a hallway, or come across you in the street.If I hear your name I will think on thisfarewell until all feeling remains unfelt.I’ve spent these long and lonely years trying to protect myself from hurt knowing of the demons I keep inside.I have felt too much sadness these past weeks.I have cried too many tears and been frozen in fear from knowing no other way to endure, to be better, to find peace. So I also say goodbye to those parts of me that are too broken to repair, but mercifully they sink deeper each day and will soon be out of my reach. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I'm supposed to be looking after my elderly grandmother for a week from this Thursday, but my depression is very bad at the moment and I feel like I can't even look after myself, let alone have someone else relying on me. Getting out of bed, having a shower or getting dressed are hard enough at the moment. I don't know what I should do or how I'm going to cope. I've already had two panic attacks just thinking about it coming up.

Hi. I am 35 yrs old. Immigrant from Pakistan.  since i was 10 years old i was bullied in school, by classmates, teachers and neighbours. As growing up in pakistan, people over do not know even the word ""Bully"". but bullying was not the only thing that contributed to my depression, i guess i inherited it, but bullying enhanced my already depressed nature. I never knew that depression is an illness, till i arrived to australia 10 years ago. Now knowing that Depression is an illness, made it a bit easy to face it. But in Australia the thing that refrained me of seeking psychologist or psychiatrist advice was the stigma attached to depression. I do not seek it, because anywhere you apply for job you come across with this question in the applying form, ""Are you suffering from depression?"". Now an immigrant from a third world country with a family to support you will never take this risk of seeking the advice and then not been able to work to support your family. As depressed person the last thing you would want, is your family suffer because of you. So i take it all on me. never sought any professional advice, and living with it. Thanks

HelloI am a singer/song writer, with a song I have written over 16 years ago that you may be interested in using to highlight or help raise awareness about depression.It was a song I have written to help me externalise the demons I have to battle with.It is one of many such songs I have written to help me cope with my depression. I don't believe I have any serious depression, just your average type that one may easily, (or not),  find a road out of.But my two teenage daughters are struggling, with medication, to find a way forward from their unhappiness.My brother has had severe depression and has to take a constant cocktail of drugs to keep himself in a happy state.And so the list goes on.It is a song that talks about the horrible things that go through my mind, what I believe causes the horrible downward spiral, and what I believe one must do to find a way out.Yours sincerely,Tyke Talty

So I went to my GP to get a script for something to help me sleep and left with a referral to see a psych and a script for anti depressants. 
It wasn't even my regular GP. I don't understand how that happened and how she could see what I apparently couldn't and says I'm back in the middle of severe depression. 
I feel  like an absolute failure. I've had the medication before. I went to counselling before. Intellectually I know how to make myself better. So why am I here again? What is the point in going through all this treatment again if it's just going to sneak on me again when I don't even know. I just feel even more depressed for recognising I'm depressed. Hate this life.

Hi all,
Do any of you with depression and anxiety get upset if others touch your personal possessions?
For example, I don't like my Dad washing my car, or anyone using my computer, as I get worried that they will ""wreck"" them.
I have had this issue my whole life, and it is a family joke. Apparently my grandmother was the same with her possessions too. And now that I know a lot more about depression, I know my Nan suffered it too although it was never diagnosed with her.
Would love to hear if anyone else has this problem? How do you handle it?
It is not normal to not want people to touch everything we own, especially a favourite coffee mug.
Is it because we want control over something as our minds are out of control a lot?
Thanks for reading,
Kellie

Hi. I have bipolar with severe depression. I've had moments of psychosis years ago. Not sure what I'm experiencing now...
I see shadows or something on the corner of my eyes - daily. Sometimes hear my name or something being called out. But live alone. Sometimes feel like something is touching me or crawling but nothing there. I get sleep paralysis occasionally. I get paranoid. I make myself believe things that I don't believe are true...feelings and beliefs. 
Been having this for a while but it's getting worse. Have been more depressed lately with spikes of mania.
Any advice or does anyone associate? Thanks in advance

I have always understood bipolar to be where you have a period of high and then a period of low.
What if in the one day you can be high mood then later on low mood or vise versa, is that bipolar or does it have to be days/weeks of high and days/weeks of low?

Hi all , I am new to this whole thing of depression . I am a 37 years old  mum of two beautiful kids . Married and have a settled life . It looks like I have been pushing myself too hard and being taken for granted . I had a conflict with my husband and then collapsed after that . I could not go back to my old me . My problem is that I feel emotionally attached and depending on my GP . He is an old friend as well , he is younger than me and not married. I understand that these are false emotion and that it is not gonna go anywhere due to back ground restrictions as well . I don't want to sacrifice my marriage and life too , but these feelings are killing me .  I feel like a teenager again . Is this something common to happen and if so how can I deal with it ? Thanks

Hi guys I'm a 31 year old male from Melbourne Australia who has had a range of events happen that has lead me to this forum ...I have always believed I had struggled with depression and anxiety but I never seemed helped, I would deal with it by using alcohol or having people around me to take my mind off it, I have always had health anxiety due to being unwell and always think the worse..  I want to touch on a few experiences in the past 4-5years that has lead me to this point of depression that I have no idea how to handle, let me just say that as a child and in my teens I seen a lot and had a lot of family turmoil that I'm sure still is unresolved and lends hand to how I feel.. anyway in 2012- I lost my long time girlfriend to the jehovah witnesses and it was a lot to handle, I have had so many bad relationships and this one I thought was "" the one"" I understand break ups but this was way out of left field, I feel like I was completely lied to and I don't even know the women I was sleeping next to, she left for the witnesses and never returned or even returns my phone calls or texts it's like she never existed 2013- I wake up with a array of neurological issues out of seemingly what felt like no where, muscle tremors, jolts, twitches, weakness and are whole host of other things. I was rushed to hospital and for the next year was going through diagnosing testing for ALS a non curable disease that will kill you in four years, I still am ongoing with these symptoms today without a diagnosis but it am pretty much bed ridden most days, the dr's are currently sending me for other tests that are not very nice to have if they are seen as positive so my anxiety is huge and I don't know If all these new symptoms are anxiety physical manifestations on top.. 2014- I had one friend who was with me through all this he came into the hospital visits and what not and was there all the time, we had been friends for 15 years, closer than family and out of the blue he disappeared with a women he met and I have seen him maybe 2-3 times since, support totally gone. 
6 months ago dad died of heart attack, out of no where, I'm broken and have guilt over it.
 i am pacing a lot, I'm alone, can't concentrate, I feel like I need to check myself into a support centre if they even exist? I feel like I lost everyone close to me and my identity and my future health is so uncertain and I'm alone dealing with all this, I don't know if I can.. I'm not suicidal but lost.

I have joined this place to get some answers about my situation. I am a family man of the early 40s. I have a 9 to 5 job. I have been dealing with depression for quite some time. I have been to a number of psychologists. All those sessions were like a band aid solution.  I ended by spending up to a couple of hundreds of dollars.  
My question is, is it possible that someone can be in the comfort zone of sadness.  For example, when I am driving back home, I have opted to listen to happy music, but I mostly choose sad music. I have become pessimistic and very cynical. I have severed ties with my relatives and with some friends. The reason being, they just cannot understand what I am going through. Most of them thinks I have the power to change myself and since I am not changing, perhaps I am making a scene out of it to grab sympathy. Is this possible that I may like the “sad” part because I have dwelt in this for long? 

Lastly – why can’t I be happy like others?

I have suffered from anxiety and depression for most of my adult life, certainly since my late teens and I am now nearly 60 years old. In this time I have been on and off medication 5 times, never for long periods but most recently I've been taking an antidepressant for the last 6 years. Despite what I thought were ""good"" Drs and psychologists over the years who treated my depression, it has only been in the last couple of months that I have grasped the full implication of the complexity of my condition.
I somehow was always expecting a ""cure"" for what ailed me and often berated myself for falling back into old patterns, back sliding into depression and somehow never made the connection that my symptoms are my depression, not neccessarily as a result of my depression.
My most difficult symptom is lethargy and finding that spark to get going. Once I'm functioning for the day, I am generally ok to keep going. Everything is such an effort, I often think ""What is the point?"" When I have been tired beyond belief and unable to get moving, staying in bed or on the couch or in the house certainly doesn't make me feel any better.
Does anyone else else suffer in this way and are there strategies you have found helpful?
I think finally I have accepted that I have depression, it can't be cured but I can manage it so that it's impact is lessened whereby I can enjoy some level of positive functioning.
Looking forward to some useful tips and insights.
Trish M.

I came to BB because reading an article about a woman with depression made me realise she was describing me to a T, but I never even considered depression. Even writing this I'm not sure, that's why I'm here, I need someone else to tell me ""You're crazy, what you're feeling is normal"" or to tell me ""You're crazy, what you're feeling is not normal.""
 So, the things that lead me here:
- For about this whole year (maybe longer?), I've felt numb. I don't feel happy, I don't feel sad, I don't feel anything most of the time. Reason I know this: I got engaged this year, felt almost nothing over it (even though i love my fiance). I got an amazing opportunity that allowed me to do volunteer work through my job, and I felt nothing, and came back and told the experience as if it happened to someone else. I went to America for 5 weeks and had (in a rational mind) some of the best experiences possible while there, but I feel no joy looking back and felt no excitement while I was there. My grandmother died 2 months ago, and I didn't feel anything even though we were close when I was growing up.
- I have no motivation to do anything. My work suffers because I don't care if I meet KPIs. I find out about things to do, but don't have the energy to do it. This weekend was a struggle just to get myself to go to the movies. I have things around the house that need doing, but I just can't get up and do them. I dropped out of uni this year for the same reason. I don't do anything with my fiance because my head just isn't there. There are days when I don't even have the motivation to shower, and then 2-3 days have pass before I realise.
- Lack of focus. I dropped out of uni as I couldn't even do the readings. At work, I lose focus in the middle of a conversation or task and struggle to concentrate.
- As a result, I often spend a lot of my weekends in bed. Lately I don't get up till lunch time and even if I'm up at a decent hour, I'm back in bed for a 3 hour nap by 1pm. Nights are spent on the couch mindlessly scrolling through social media.
-I have no desire for sex And it rarely happens. When there is physical intimacy, my arousal only lasts about 10minutes before it dies.
- I often have a short fuse over the smallest things. About 6 weeks ago there was a point where I got so angry, my fiance told me that I actually scared him.
 If someone else told me they were like this, I wouldn't second guess the fact that they should see a doctor, so why am I second guessing myself?

I find I'm becoming increasingly reclusive as | get older.  Whilst I know that people with depression are discouraged from isolating themselves socially, I just find life is easier for me this way.   I mainly only associate with fellow sufferers because nobody else understands and they say stupid stuff like, ""just think positive"" or ""but you have a lovely house/son/husband/life etc"", and all the usual stuff we all hear.   And as I approach the outskirts of 50, I just can't be bothered trying to explain myself to people who don't understand and never will.  Is it really that bad to protect myself from these well meaning but totally clueless people?   I mean, even people in my own family haven't got a clue what my life is like!   I recently told my brother about my life long battle and he has stopped talking to me!!!!  Luckily I have a very supportive husband, as he has PTSD and totally understands what this disease is really like.   Does anyone else push people away?  And, is it really that bad to be semi-reclusive, if that's where I feel safest?   I don't mind my own company to be honest and I have 5 lovely pets who love me regardless of my mood.  So what if I live like a hermit!!!    Shouldn't we all do what makes us feel most comfortable?

I've been training at work as if I am joining their department so I can do time-in-motion studies and process efficiency studies.
Tuesday night I didn't sleep well I was going on the phones Wednesday. Wednesday morning arrives and I feel like I'm coming down with the flu. No energy and a bit anxious. I got half way to work on the train and messaged my boss (who is really really supportive) that I couldn't make it.
I got home drank 3 glasses of sports drink as I thought I might be dehydrated (one of the meds I take makes it easy to dehydrate).
For the last 3 days I've felt hopeless, uninspired, still bored with life and generally horrible. 
I've had depression for 20 years, probably longer. The root cause has been my father leaving when I was 4. There are some other family traits that contribute and also genetic predisposition. I see a psychiatrist every week and have done for the past 4 years I feel like progress has slowed and I spend the time staring out the window in his office. Expensive view.
I was dating a guy for about 2 months, he seemed to be just perfect! Even said he loves me. Then I got anxiety about the relationship and that had me in bed for a week. Then I got depression and that had me in bed for another week. The guy was good about it and understood - he said- as he had suffered depression as well - he even wrote and published a book about it. Anyway, he decides that he doesn't want to continue pursuing a relationship because it's not fun. He just wants it to be fun. Ride our motorbikes, and watch telly and go out and all the fun things. I guess that I have an illness isn't fun for him.
That was 9 weeks ago and it's still affecting me - I guess that it reminds me unconsciously that I musn't be good enough because my father left as well.
I don't understand what I think was an Anxiety attack over going on the phones at work as I have had multiple roles from phone support to CEO in my career.
So I'm in bed typing at the world because I have very few friends I can emotionally blurt at.
I should be out motorbike riding, or in Sydney visiting my family who have gathered or at the beach. I can't even bring myself to go to Spotlight to get some fabric as I like sewing as well.
I'm bored with life and what I have to hold on to is becoming less and less.

Hi guys,  I've never posted on here before but I have found myself feeling absolutely miserable lately and empty inside. I'm at a loss as to how to overcome these feelings of emptiness and feeling lost in life.
I don't know if I have depresssion my Dr has suggested anti depressants. I have had a lot of stuff happen over the last few months- I injured my knee and can't work and am awaiting surgery.  I can't play sport because of it and am usually very active. 
I've had to move house and I find myself hating my new place.  And I've also had issues with a guy who is constantly hot and cold towards me. Whenever I go to him for help he is cold yet if he comes to me on his terms it's a different story. He has helped me out financially and stuff but says he doesnt want a relationship with me.
So I guess the past month or so I have found myself so miserable and feeling down. Even when around friends I feel teary and crap. I feel so alone and do lost and empty.
Sorry for the long post. Just wondering if anyone has any tips as to how to het through feeling this way

So I've had a tough week with my black dog nipping at my heels or lying on my chest weighing it down so I can't breath.  At work I lead a close team and knowing I'm struggling right now thought I'd explained as best you can to people with happy lives why I may seem withdrawn, quick to tears and not my 'usual' bubbly self - you know to let them feel at ease so they don't think its them or they've done something wrong. Had a really bad morning and there I am in a car with a work mate trying to hold back tears, put some kind of expression on my face and find the energy to speak at all.  After getting back to the office this same work mate who is moving to another department seems to be thinking its their leaving that is causing me to be withdrawn, asking whats happened in the last couple of days is seeking answers from other people and telling them that I'm giving them the cold shoulder. Funny since here I was totally embarrassed, humiliated for crying and feeling like a needy, high maintenance drama queen and thought I'd let them know its not them its just a tough time for me right now and I'm struggling but hope this isn't defining me. I'm trying to remember that people without depression have no idea what its like and I can't expect them to understand that once in the grip of depression it doesn't just go away overnight. I've spent the trip home this afternoon in the car both angry and crying wishing there was some way for non-depressed people to get the smallest insight into what's going on inside me right now - without judgement or criticism. The quick and repeated thoughts of self loathing with evidence my sick brain finds everywhere, the despair and panic that it isn't going to end, the lump in my throat, the ache in my chest, the feeling like something is squeezing my lungs from the inside and above all that all my decreased energy is being spent on trying to put one foot in front of the other, put some kind of expression on my face while desperately trying not to cry in public and stopping myself from running away from work as fast as possible and never ever going back there. I'm seeing my psychologist every couple of days but even there were I have felt such relief I don't want to talk, I don't want to try. I'm tired of trying to hide my depression so everyone else feels ok when all I want is someone to be strong for me and say its ok - i know this isn't the real you and I won't hold this against you.

I've spent this whole year getting back on my feet and enjoying a slow paced romance. In the last few months I've gotten a new job, a car and grown even closer to my friend/lover. 
 I suffer from depression and anxiety, I do not receive medical attention and I'm not currently getting any therapy... I've said to myself many times to do so, but like most tasks it seems so hard to do.
Mostly things have been getting better and it has been great to connect with someone I feel really understand and respects me...
My friend/lover started with one bad day that seemed like a week. After a couple days of no contact which isn't normal, I reached out and asked how I could help... He asked me to forget about him. That he was depressed and hated himself. That he was gonna get help, but that asking me to forget him was harder than he could ever explain...
I offered to give him space but revised to simply forget about him.
I know that I have no control in this situation, but it has triggered every negative feeling in my while body. I'm a mother, a usually strong person, but I just feel so repeatedly rejected. This hurts even more because I've been so guarded and careful in this relationship and it was beautiful and felt very equally reciprocated... I don't know where to organize anything.
I feel a little better than crash, right back destroyed... I pray and pray... This can't be happening

Hi everyone. 
I'm new to this.  I just rang the 1300 number and they were very helpful. Unfortunately had to cut the phone call short as my flatmate came home.. :-/
Ive been emotional in the last couple of days. The last few years have been a blur. I think things came crashing down yesterday and today. 
I don't know if its the ""monthlys"", family stress, work stress or the fact that my ex won't share custody with my dog.  I think it's a combination of the above and that I do shift work and haven't had proper sleep in 4days! :( 
Work- there's  a little bully... I've been transferred to a different workplace but same company. 
Family- obligation to send money to overseas family.. helping out my sibling with his own demons.  My father was abusive.
I miss my dog. He's a beautiful furchild. Boundless love. Lots if cuddles... :)
Sorry I'm ranting... aimlessly.  Hard to type on my phone :( 
 I cried all day after work. I worked 5am till 1300. Sobs. Tears. A ray of sunshine one day.
Is there a higher power.. a ""god"". 
Sometimes I feel so lost.. so alone. Yet I feel guilty... cos I'm an adult and should know how to handle my emotions.  
I need a new job. :( I need my dog.  :)

Hey everyone. This is strange, and I'm sure this is the third time in my life I have attempted to post something on here. Don't get me wrong, it's not deleted by the monitoring staff - rather it is deleted my myself as I usually come to the conclusion that my problems are insignificant and no one wants to hear about it.. so I end up deleting what my heart just poured out. 
I have been sitting here, starting out the window for the past hour. Just in silence, watching the world go by without me. I need help. 
I am 26 years old and from Sydney. I am living in a tiny apartment with my partner of four years. I have suffered with depression since high school. I became heavily into drugs shortly after leaving as I felt for the first time I felt happy on them - but the come down made me suicidal. I was able to quit after purging my life of my friends who were also heavily in this scene, but since then though I have also been lonely. I went to university and developed severe anxiety - I dropped 10kg in 3 months and had a BMI if 16. This continued over the next 5 years and I sacrificed everything because the fear of getting below my expectations of 'HD' was debilitating. My depression continued underneath this, although I felt I didn't have time to have these feelings.. than I needed to push on and focus. Many anxiety attacks followed. 
 Now, I'm working in an unstable profession (not much I can do about this), in a horrible workplace (no much I can do about this) and have limited friends (I pushed them all away over the past 5 years). I saw a therapist who was helpful, although I am unable to see her within my working hours. 
I feel as though I am wasting away. I have no purpose, I have no desire, I have no passion. I feel as though there is nothing for me to do or live for except the happiness of others. Things that used to make me happy seem just to skim across my face in a smile but don't touch my heart. I have tried so many times to reach out to people - I get responses such as  'oh.. that sucks.. anyway how's work?' or 'there's a lot of people in the world that are worse off than you. Be grateful.' My partner listens, but doesn't really know what to say or what to do. 
I'm just desperate in my moment of clarity for someone to understand, to connect to someone. I want help, and I don't know what to do. I'm tried of being this way. I'm tired of being alone all the time (mentally and physically). I hope this place will help. Ideas?
 
Thanks for reading.

Hi, 
I am new to the forums however not new to depression and anxiety. I have suffered for about 16 years but probably been at my worst this past year. 
I do what I can to keep on track and am aware of the signs when I'm heading for the lows. Exercise, meditation, reasonable eating, medication ...unfortunately due to a chronic illness, some of that medication makes it difficult to stay on track. I've have fallen in a heap but don't feel like explaining to anyone..mostly due to the fear of being perceived as weak. Even as I typed that I know it's unreasonable and unfair to make that judgment of others.  My family are loving but have enough on their plates without worrying about me. My husband, well he goes fishing to avoid dealing with crying. My two girls keep me going. I know it will pass and it's one foot in front of the other. I'm hoping the forums will make the teeth grinding a bit more bearable during my low.

Hi, I'm a mum to two gorgeous boys 4(almost 5) and 2 and I have depression. I have my good and bad days. It can be so hard to cope with everyday things. Having depression makes me not have as much patience as I use to have I used to be so calm and happy. Now I'm on edge all the time and find it hard to relax. Every few months I reach my limit and break down into tears then I pick myself up again. 
I just wish I didn't have depression so I could be a happy fun mum.
anyone else have a similar story?

Hey all.
So I find life hard most of the time since everything seems to have a negative effect on me. I work 5 days a week and my work mates just don't make me feel welcome. They make smart remarks and laugh at my stupidity. Don't get me wrong, most of the people at work are fantastic and friendly. 
My ""friends"" do pretty much the same. I have a handful of genuine friends that support me, but just feels like I have to make all the effort. I am 21 and have had depression for a while now. But just feels like it gets worse and worse over time. I don't want to have to take pills or anything like that. I just would like help with finding a solution to ignore the remarks and stay happy. I know people say just don't take it to heart.. But that is easier said then done. 

I have some problems with myself also. I am overweight, I sweat a lot also. From my armpits and hands mostly. It's a weakness of mine that keeps me from going out often. The only thing that really makes me feel happy is video gaming with my online friends, and going to music concerts to see my favourite bands. But obviously that is not healthy for me. 

Anyway, I hope there is some advice or someone going through a similar situation that I can connect with and talk to.
Thanks for reading

Why does this overwhelming depression come over me out of the blue? I'm travelling along nicely... yes I'm on medication and have regular sessions with my psychologist.I get so fed up with feeling this way I want to cry. Yes this may be therapeutic  but the medication dulls this area and I am not able to cry. I've been on hols  so out of routine-have I answered my own question? I just want this pain to stop I can't share this with anyone so decided to join BB online forum I find it very hard to connect with anyone when in this frame of mind.

I am feeling pretty depressed in the 2nd week of the school holidays looking after 3 children 2x3 year old and 1x6 year old plus looking after my 87 year old mother in law which thank god goes back saturday. my depression comes and goes but its always still the same just a feeling of utter dispear all the time. Im 42 years old. a stay at home dad and all ambition and passion for life has left me. Doing anything these days is hard. Ive actually had depression since I was young but it would come and go though plus I was young so I always felt some kind of hope. Now I feel like Ive already got 1 foot in the grave. I dont want happy pills. I dont want to talk to my wife about it shes no help at all. Im eager to get out into the workforce again but I need some kind of energy. My self confidence is shot.

Hi,
 My first post! I haven't seeked help before but maybe asking if anyone else experiences social phobia might make me feel less alone. 
i find it hard getting out of bed each day but having to shop or even get fuel for my car is frightening. I stay home more than I go out. Work has suffered and Im 27 with no social life. Gained 20kg in first 12 months of depression, which doesn't help either. 
 i feel like the phobia of seeing people or talking face to face, won't ever leave! Anyone have any tips?

hi,
I have recently been experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression that are. Making it hard for me to function as normal. I have seen my doctor and she has scheduled an appointment tomorrow for me to probably be prescribed medication. 
I feely really uneasy about this. I know that I need help and I started seeing a psychologist 3 months ago when I first realised I was struggling. I thought it was issues related to deaths in my family but other things have come out of the therapy and I now feel like I am spiralling out of control. I am having trouble sleeping because my heart won't stop pounding, I feel in a constant state of fear or really low. I am finding eating difficult. I have been off work for over a week and have managed to say it was due to asthma and infection but I don't know how much longer I can hide the truth. I am worried I won't be able to work if I can't control this. I feel to ashamed to admit what is going on as it is a relatively new job. If I try to go in I am worried I will have a break down at the slightest thing because I am so jumpy, on edge and exhausted.
 i just don't know what to do :(
 would love some advice

I've had depression for about ten years now and I am on maintenance doses of antidepressants under a specialist. I am someone who is generally highly active with work and exercise. Every few months I still have relapses in my depression and for no real apparent reason. I know it is an illness and their doesn't have to be a trigger, but it is really hard to deal with.  I usually notice it coming on when my dreaming becomes really vivid and I can't get into a deep sleep and I get the early morning waking cycle back. I was wondering whether anyone else experiences the same thing and what are their way of dealing with this?

I don't know how many times I have wondered what's the point? I have recently been diagnosed with depression anxiety and ocd but I can't remember a time that I've been truly happy.
i feel like my self worth has hit an all time low. I find myself constantly doubting every decision I've ever made. I am unable to hold a steady relationship because I self sabotage and question their motives. I often wonder why I'm here and why someone would be put on this earth to feel this bad...
i know I'm not the only person to have depression and to feel like this. I want to be happy. I look at my beautiful nephew and the smiles he gives me and I wanna be the person he sees that isn't broken. 
Thankyou for reading about me and making it to the end of my rambles. I don't know what I was trying to accomplish by writing this down. I will forever be amazed at how many tears the human body can produce...

Hi everyone, it is so nice to find this forum. I have been through a really tough few years and didn't want my friends to experience me so low and what I believed 'self consumed.' I used to have many friends and now that my old self has returned I don't have any friends. Worse still, I am trying to reconnect but they don't seem interested. I am 42 now and miss my friends. This alone makes me feel like I am going back into a depression. I am so desperate for friends and lonely but I feel like people think something is wrong with me. I can't communicate like I used to. I tried a yoga group but even found that clicky and I felt excluded. Has anyone experienced this? Thankyou for listening. X

I don't know what to say. I've hit rock bottom. I don't know what to do. I'm gay. I live in a country I feel hates me...at least the government. I can't marry my partner. I've had to quit a job because at staff meetings they talked about homosexuality as a psychological disorder. My next job was worse. At the Christmas part I was called a fag. When I tried to talked to my boss about it the next day, he shrugged it off and says they were letting their hair down. So I quit that profession. I'm at home now. I write in hopes to be published, but the pay isn't regular. My partner is working his butt off to support us both. I'm trying. I'm failing. My family have abandoned me. My friends have abandoned me. I am trying. I just don't know who I am anymore. Why was I born? Why am I here?

I was just walking my dog, and as usual my head is over at the dark side, it used to only visit this side,  but now it appears it is spending more and more time over there. I thought how good would it be if we could all meet on this side. No more loneliness, people to talk to with the same dark thoughts, hey we could even have a dark party. Just maybe we could see some light together.......

Lost a friend today. Over Facebook of all places. I'm beginning to think Facebook and depression don't mix. 
I suffer from depression. Sometimes I'm irrational. I'm paranoid. I'm fearful. I'm angry. I'm scared. I feel like the world is against me. I lash out against even the best of friends. I'm tired. I'm lonely. It's a cycle. A constant battle. I'm trying. 
Sometimes I get it in my head that people are talking behind my back or I recognise some of their complaints in their statuses as how I act. So I think they are referring to me. So I'll confront them impulsively.
 
She said some pretty hurtful truths and criticisms. She recognised that I immediate jump to conclusions and have low self esteem and paranoia. I was accused of draining the joy from her life. That not everything was about me or that everyone is out to get me.
 
I can't help it though and her reaction only confirms to me that maybe I am a terrible friend and a terrible person.

 I have suffered from depression for the last 15 years, to the point of me losing control and trying to commit suicide.  As I have slowly rebuilt myself, and learned more about this great lie. Depression is a great lie because it based on lies that we tell ourselves.
 
I am fat, I am worthless, I have no friends, my family hates me,   I am not worth loving. These are just some of the great lies that we tell ourselves, and we believe these lies because our emotions are running our head not the logical side of us.  All of these things and more are going on in our minds . 
What does  ""Change your truth."" mean?  You see we each hold our own truth, what may be true for one person may not be true for another person.  With depression the key to winning this war, even the small battles with it, which turn into great victories if we allow, is to change our own truth about ourselves.  You see all those lies that I mentioned before, a lot of them have a grain of truth in it, that is why we start to believe all of these negative emotions that we have. It gets so bad that we overwhelm ourselves, and can not see the honest truth. 
 
Logic is the key to fighting depression and here is how Change Your Truth, comes in to effect. What we need to do is take, one of the negative thoughts about ourselves, lets say you keep seeing yourself as fat because of the weight you have put on...the truth of the matter is sure you may have put on 5 or 6 pounds, but when you look into the mirror you do not see these 5 or 6 pounds what you see when you look at yourself is this false image of a person that looks like a blimp.  Yet the reality is that you are not a blimp but our minds do not let us see the truth.So what do we do? 
 
We Change our Truth, this is a hard thing to do, but once you start with ONE negative thought, and truly look at it with logic, not with emotions, you find that grain of truth and you CHANGE it...so you have gained a little weight, get up and go for a walk, go outside and watch your kids or pets play and get a little active. I am not talking about running a marathon, even if its just going down the front steps and walking to the end of your drive away and back, do that every day for a week, then next week, go beyond your drive way and go a little farther each week.
 
This way you change YOUR truth as you will see that the weight is coming off.  This is how you change YOUR Truth about yourself! It is not easy but you can do it!

Hi everyone
ok so I know depression and anxiety skews your thoughts. I know other people suffer. I know I'm not alone, but then why do I still feel so lonely?
is it because depression is so unique to each individual? Perhaps my depression is not the same as yours. Or is that the anxiety talking?
Lately I have been really wondering what the meaning of this all is. Why do we get up each morning, go to work, eat, sleep repeat? Like guinea pigs on a wheel. I envy people who don't have these thoughts. I look at people walking by me on the street, at work, and think ""lucky you, that you don't have these thoughts, that you don't feel like I do.""
And if there's no meaning, then what's the purpose? And if there's no purpose, then what's the point? And if I am thinking this way, then God what is wrong with me?! How could I be so selfish as to even have that thought cross my mind.
i know this post sounds a lot more like a string of rhetorical questions, but hoping somebody can relate.

This weekend was the first for me to be fully alone. Children were away and the house was very empty and quiet.
I tried to keep myself busy, but you find yourself slipping back to thinking in the negative. Tears were shed at random moments. The sting of a partner gone all to prevelant.
I then think to myself, well this is your lot in life, need to start preparing for a life alone. I truly feel that one should not have to be alone. Unfortunately with my circumstances that is a reality I am now facing. 
So what do you do when friends don't call back or you are limited in what you can join? BB is a great help, people listen and care, but the lack of physical contact can start to wear you down. I have a fear of if something happened to me - who would know? 
I know I am the only person who can change this - trying to find the inner strength to do this is the challenge. 
I wonder????

Struggle to get out of bed.
Lately my depression and Anxiety has hitten rock bottom and I can bearly find the effort to get out of bed,even if it is just for a few moments to go to the loo or plug my phone in. 
I no longer feel my medication is working and it is still hard for me to go and get the help I need. 
I now am living in another state and I thought once I move things will start to get better but in fact they have got worse. Although I live with the fact that living here is the only way that I will get the help I need without family shouting in my ear with the stigma we grew up with that I don't need antidepressants and I have nothing to be depressed about. But I know it is real to me and I do have nothing to be depressed about. But I do live with depression a condition that does not discriminate. 
I know I need help and in need it now... as I can not tolerate the unhelpful thoughts that go through my head at night they are like torture and I have never been so scared in my life.
but every time I go to get help I chicken out. I was going to go to a support group the other night  but I got to front door and turned around I was going to make an appointment to go to a GP today but well at least I thought about it. 
I guess being out of the house for more then two hours is just too much for me at the moment.... Although I do feel like staying in bed all day and know if I do go out of the house for more then two hours is exhausting I make sure I do try to make the effort every day to go out for an hour or two as I have found even just a little bit of sunshine helps my mood...
thanks for listening I guess my goal for the next week is to find a good GP in this city that bulks bills and understands mental health issues..

I've had mental issues back last year when everything got so so overwhelming. My partner was/is still currently working overseas and I was what felt like in a deep black hole. I felt like I was loosing my sanity. Short story is that whilst seriously considering finishing everything and thankfully having the CAT team come out and guide me through the most overwhelming negative attitude I could ever imagine I managed to find my way through. My partner in that period came back for several days and left again. I'm put on medication which was quite confronting dealing with not being able to think and just fuzzing through every day for a number of months. Sure the thoughts went away but there seemed like no thoughts going through my mind. I finished up weaning my way off it with a number of side effects mid year.Fast forward a few months and I've just come back from a trip to see my Partner overseas and my mind starts to go into a downward spin again. I fought and fought these massively negative, hopeless feelings yet again. I fell into not leaving home instead of going to the gym and I started making more mistakes at work (been there 8 years). Things just started going bad to worse, hardly eating, not wanting to go out and last week finished up with the flu and had the week off to recover. Over the weekend I nosedived again, deeper into the abyss. That dirty disgusting black hole game up for another bite of me.  I tried to act normal but felt absolutely gutted that this was now coming back. I didn't want to tell my partner as he has enough to deal with overseas. Today I went into work and sat at my desk and started crying. I'm a man of 48 years and don't cry very easily at all. I went over and said to my senior that I needed to leave and was not fit to be in at work and would need some time away. I said that I'd call my Team Leader once I got home.I called my doctors and have been told I can't get into see him until tomorrow. I've rang my Team Leader back and tried to explain the situation and asked if I can have some time off. I even said I would take annual or Long Service Leave. Her response was, well how long do you think you want off? I'm just dumbfounded at this. She said we'll see what your doctor says tomorrow. My partner was, ok well I'll have to try and get a transfer back to the city we live in, it can't continue like this. It was dismissive in both counts and I feel more depressed that no one seems to give a stuff about this black hole I'm in.

Basically I cannot find enjoyment with anything anymore. I recently moved back from Melbourne where I was a furniture maker and in the coffee industry and was dealing and maintaining my depression and anxiety which I had been diagnosed with in 2012 with tablets. But I went through numerous tablets and basically came to the conclusion the numbness I felt from the tablets was inhibiting my creativity and was worse than how I was feeling. so I took myself off them and for 6 months I was very up and down but I was creative again and had drive. Until I ultimately crashed and became very irrational and basically couldn't handle 'being here anymore'.
 So I moved back in with my parents to seek help through medication and be in a relaxing environment but all I am feeling is nothing again, this is my 5 shot at a different medication and I feel numb, the idea of exercise to help combat the negative feelings is so hard when I truly don't enjoy anything. Running/shooting hoops/surfing has become almost painfully unenjoyable.
I don't have a lot of friends and my girlfriend is my biggest supporter but basically I just feel alone, I've tried turning off social media as it makes me feel more and more isolated. Also all I ever want to do it sleep, every afternoon I lay down and snooze or in the morning before work I wake up and I just cannot get up. I feel like I have no reason too
im struggling with my coping because there's this feeling that I can only describe as a big thick wall that's just so full of negativity and blackness that is stopping this little slither of myself trying to fight back to get better and it's just this unbreakable force.

Hi,
I have recently been diagnosed with Depression and anxiety. I believe that I have been suffering badly from these illnesses for about 3 years , however the more i learn about Depression and anxiety i believe that this has been around my whole life. 
I was adopted at 4 months of age and I feel a lot of my issues relate to being adopted,  abandoned and never feeling i fitt in with my adoptive family. I would like to speak with anyone who has a similar experience or even adoptive or birth parents to get their perspective.  
Thanks.

Hi all,
Been trying so hard to keep my inner strength intact and then I realise i have been putting a mask on my emotions that i feel like i am coming apart at the seams. I am fighting the hardest battle in my life. Myself. Coming right back to this dont fit in to this world again feeling. My real battle is that i know i have most of the answers to my own problems but get so lost then i get oozing waves of deppressed emotions so strong that causes  panic attacks and feelings of uselessness. Everthing is such an effort and i am feel like i am winging even when i am seeking help and support. I am unemployed Horticulturist and reached a point in my life being 50 years old that time is flying by and yet i cringe every day i waste away with sabotaging thought processes and realising i am not very employable due to unreliability due to not coping eventhough i have tried cbt and councellors. How do you guys hold down a job when you're moods fluctuate  that it impacts your performance reguraly? Does anybody actually understand me here? I read the newspaper today and upon reading the latest cases of terrible domestic violence i cried like a baby. Whats my problem i said to myself but i am still deppressed to the core. Hope to chat to somebody who understands me.Mick

Sick of everything at the moment.
I got fired from a job in real estate 2 months ago (for not gelling with the team and not being dynamic enough).
I am most likely going to get fired from a job I have been in for a month tomorrow as I am not quick enough (as a waiter in a cafe).
A girl I like seems to not like me back (never had a girlfriend and am 31 years old, keep getting rejected)
I have started performing my songs live at open mic sessions and I suck, I can't even do the thing I love the most well.
I don't know what to do with myself. I am a big failure at everything I try.
Sick of rejections and failures everywhere.
I feel like I was a mistake being born into this world.
My medication seems to not be working lately. Feeling so low.

Here I go - my first post.  I've been on other community forums before, quite a bit in fact, but I feel quite vulnerable here for some reason.  It feels awkward.  Anyway I am struggling so I will attempt to tell my story in the hope of getting some support.
I am a 60 year old woman.  I live alone with my 2 old doggies and work part time.  I had a chronic illness, which I have now conquered and cleared, but I have residual fatigue which limits my ability to work.  I am generally quite well, pretty fit, and on the surface I appear comfortable.  
Inside, however, I am feeling extremely isolated and this is causing anxiety and depression.  I have quite a good job but no job security so I'm never certain when it will end so I am always on the lookout for something else.  But because I am limited to part time work I find the opportunities are limited and when I do apply for jobs I don't even get an interview.  I live in a nice little house that I rent but again I have had no security here as the landlord didn't renew my lease.  I have a difficult relationship with him because he treats me like I'm an idiot so now I am trying to move and this is causing me a lot of anxiety.
Those are the two main sort of big-ticket items, but really it is my whole life that is getting to me.  I'm just so unhappy.  I have very few friends and pretty much nobody to talk to.  I take my dogs to the dog park every day and there used to be a really good group there who I got quite close to, but over time the dogs passed away and the group dissolved and now my dogs & I walk by ourselves. 
My family all lives overseas.  For a few years we were all in touch regularly with an active email loop.  But now in the age of mobile devices the emails are all shorter and they often don't reply at all. They have each other and I have often tried to convey to them that I would appreciate more contact but I don't get anywhere with that.  A recent trip to visit them was excruciatingly frustrating for me and I cried myself to sleep each night while I was there.
I am seeing a counselor, just started last week.  I will continue that, with another appointment next week.  He is lovely but I feel my issues are quite deep and will take some time to peel away the layers.  I'm struggling in the meantime and not coping well.  I get anxious and panicky and start crying and can't stop.  Even meditation isn't helping and I am trying to address my social isolation but so far it all feels too hard.
Thanks for your help.

Things in my life are just getting harder and harder at the moment. I recently lost my job and things have gone down hill since. I have always put on a smile and tried to make people any people that I meet smile but deep down I feel as if I am slowly rotting from the inside its getting harder and harder to put a smile on when all I want to do is break down. I moved away from my family 2 years ago with my girlfriend and I have recently fallen out with my father which has only added more stress and anxiety in my life I live 3 hours away from my family which is starting to take its toll. My girlfriend is the most amazing person in the world and my best friend but she has had health problems recently and the last thing she needs is me sharing my problems on top of her own. I tried to speak to my mother about the anxiety I have been feeling and all she said back to me was that everyone in our family has it (she didn't understand) I feel alone and lost and worthless with no end in sight. I need something someone to talk to because it's all getting too much.

Hi,  i am new here. I have recently sought help from my gp regarding what I believe is depression. I feel i have been struggling to fight off the depression for around 3 years. I have a beautiful family, loving wife, 4 healthy children and a well paying job, nice home ect (nothing to be depressed about)Over the past few years i feel as though everything is increasingly an effort, even on the best days i have to make a conscious effort to be happy, i struggle with confidence and constantly doubt myself at work and home, I  feel usesless and stupid. I find myself doubting my relationships with my family and friends and dont want to be around them. I am struggling to get 4hrs a night sleep, (i also work shifts) i worry about things to the point of making myself ill, i constantly feel lonely and need to be hugged touched which im sure is driving my wife away. We have just had a baby  3 months ago so she undestanably has very little time or desire for me but as hard as i try i cannot be rational about this and constantly push her for intimacy, (pushing her away and making me feel horrible) I have been unusually angree at my wife and children and loosing my temper as i have never done before. I got to a very low point after issues at work and home became too much and i left work in tears and decided to seek help. My GP agreed after talking with me that i was suffering depression and prescribed medication. I have only been talking this 2 weeks and have some better days but some worse days even to thoughts of self harm although I don't think I could ever do that to my children. My GP put me on a mental health plan and reffered me to a psychologist. At the initial consultation with the Psychologist she asked a few questions,  no where near as in depth as the GP maybe 5mins , then asked so what are you depressed about? followed by i don't think its depression or maybe mild and anxiety . Don't think you need medication just change your diet and exercise and come back in 5 weeks ?  I was like WTF ??? So that's where I am at now after finally taking the leap to get help im left feeling worse than beforehand. Im still taking the medication and hoping it has some effects soon or at the very  least gives the side effect of loss of sex drive / libido so at least i wont have to worry about that and pushing my wife away. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I have had severe anxiety and depression for the last nine months. I think it was triggered after taking a small amount of powder cocaine last summer. I knew it was a stupid thing to do, but I was feeling quite dissapointed with my life at the time. I didn't like my job, was always arguing with and resenting my girlfriend, I couldn't keep seem to keep still, not sleeping well and drinking and smoking a bit of cannabis every weekend. This went on for a few years. It wasn't great, but it was manageable and I felt ok most of the time. Then things got worse with my job and girlfriend and I just thought what is the point of being stuck in this situation I hate for the rest of my life ? I thought the cocaine might help me enjoy life and I could keep it under control. I had tried it once quite a few years ago.It did what I expected, but not for long. Shortly after taking it I felt fantastic, but then a few days later I was sitting with my girlfriend and felt a sensation in my head like the blood was draining out. Then I started feeling really dizzy and had a massive panic attack and sort of felt like I wasn't real. I tried going to bed and sleeping it off but found I couldn't sleep. These symptoms have continued ever since along with depression and anxiety of a magnitude I never thought possible. I threw away all the cocaine when these symptoms first started and haven't touched any since.I have been doing lots of walking, eating very healthily, trying to do the CA program, cutting down caffeine and nicotine, tracking my mood in a spreadsheet every day and trying to get on with normal things.  The insomnia did get better after a few months, maybe after I quit alcohol and I have improved since then in other areas as well. But I am still very depressed and have feelings of overwhelming guilt. I see the bad in everything most of the time and get intrusive thoughts that make me totally hate myself. Things look empty and meaningless and I can't really find enjoyment or pleasure in anything I do.I tried an antidepressant briefly but it made me feel really bad. I couldn't sleep and was having bizarre thoughts so I had to stop after 2 days. I am very frightened of the side effects of prescription drugs and if my problem is essentially addiction, then how can they help because anti depressants are not a silver bullet for addiction.In the evening after dinner when the sun sets is my favorite time because I usually feel a sense of relative peace and optimism descend on me.

I like a lot of people here suffer major depression and anxiety.  I cry everyday, feel ill and nervous, hate my life and do not want to be here anymore.  I've been through all the steps taking meds which are sickening and cause so many side effects it's just stupid, I have a Pschycologist, I've seen pschychiatrists, I've been in hospital, I've done writing exercises, mindful practices, exercise, healthy eating, taking vitamins and so much more I haven't written.I asked my Pschycologist one day when she was giving me advice if she'd ever been through anxiety and depression, her answer was no.  And there you have it, the people that try to help have usually never been through this debilitating mental torture and it's all just text book to them.  I have never felt any relief or felt any better after years of treatment. I work full time as a student supervisor/disability support worker, I was a team leader for 6 yrs, I go to work everyday with no passion for my job anymore and hating every minute of it.  My weekends consist of crying and dreading Monday's.   I have to work to survive but I wish I could leave, the current team leader is an opinionated, heartless cow who is the managers gay partner so staff do not have a leg to stand on. That is a conflict of interest right there but we can't do anything about it.  I have no back up plan, I'm 56 1/2 yrs old and I do not drive so I can't change services either.I have 2 daughters and 3 grandkids that live away from home.  I live by myself and I feel alone, isolated and forgotten,  even though my mum and brothers live close by, they have their own lives.  I have no one to talk to, I don't have any close friends and I've been single for 13 yrs after separating from a mentally and emotionally abusive de facto husband of 23yrs.  All I know is I hate living, I'm not suicidal though.  Everyday is torture and I know for a fact no treatments work because I've tried it all.  So all I can do is just keep living in hell everyday and wait for this nightmare to hurry and end. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I started thinking about this a few weeks back, and I wanted to get some other people's insights. I've done a bit of writing just for something to do, and I was thinking about writing a story about a person whose depression manifests itself as a physical being.
For me, I kind of pictured it as a big black lizard-thing that sits on my shoulders and digs in with its claws, and doesn't want to let go.
What about you guys?

I haven't been here for a while and have been a reader rather than much of a poster but am so exhausted pretending to be okay that I need somewhere to say that I'm really not okay.  
My partner of 8 1/2 years left me in March. I wasn't really expecting it although in hindsight I guess he couldn't deal with my depression and anxiety. I spoke to my doc when it initially happened and allowed myself a period of grief but now everyone seems to expect me to be over it and moving on and I can't. I cry constantly still. Work and everyday interactions tire me out so much I have no energy to cook or clean etc. I am losing friends as I cancel on them all the time as the thought of going out and pretending to have fun is so exhausting. 
Exercise is the only thing I enjoy but am probably moving into an obsessive addiction to that as I feel so terrible if I miss a day. 
I went on a holiday with a group of people and again the pretending to have fun tested my limits. I cried when alone every chance I got out of exhaustion.  I'm not suicidal but I cried the other day when almost got hit on a pedestrian crossing accidentally and in that split second before the driver was able to stop I had a tremendous sense of relief at the thought that ""this is it"". I was devastated when they were able to stop. 
Ive had counselling, previously taken medication.  I know all the tools. I'm not asking for tips or help as I don't think there is anything that can help. I guess I just keep pretending and hope one day it falls into my new reality.

I am 25 years old, and have a masters degree in accounting. After graduating in May 2014, I got a job in October 2014 as an estimator at a lighting distributor company. I hated it. Offices are not my thing, which is a shame because my degree almost demands I work in an office setting. I was fired in April of this year due to being caught applying for another job on a company computer. Yes, I'm aware this was very stupid, and have been reminded by everyone I've told. So please... do not refer to this as I'm aware what I did was stupid. Honestly though, I was happy that I was fired because I hated working there. It is now 5 months later and I am still jobless, largely in part by my lack of search for a job. I find it difficult to search for a job when I have no motivating factors to get one, other than to move out of my parents home. I feel empty inside all the time and lonely. But it is if my body/mind has gotten used to being lonely, so I don't even feel it anymore. I have the worst luck when it comes to women. I have had one serious relationship in my 25 years of living, and it got messed up and now she's with someone else. I am overweight. I feel like as if my heart is completely broken in half and there is no fixing it. I can't even currently imagine finding the feelings for someone. I used to get a heart sinking feeling in my chest with loneliness and now I am just numb. I can experience laughter and I wouldnt say I'm severely depressed because I actually have gotten to the point where I feel absolutely nothing. I'm not even sure how much physical pain could effect me at this point.  My parents are getting tired of me not having a job. I have applied for some jobs, and am currently applying to some more. But my dad just came into my room screaming about how he cant sleep because of what Im doing to him. ... Because what I'm doing is deliberate clearly... I know that once I get a job and move out, my parents are going to see so much less of me. Another part of my understands where they are coming from, and knows that I am lucky to have parents that are willing to let me live with them. In no way am I saying that I have it worse of than some other people, but in my opinion it's all relative.  I have seen a therapist recently, and I honestly feel like it is little to no help to me because I recognize what is wrong and I just feel too unmotivated to fix it.

Why do people keep insisting that I'm faking it? Do they realize how damaging that is to someone with depression and anxiety!!!?? No I don't show any outward signs of symptoms but that do t mean squat. I've been told I'm of the rare percentage of people who don't follow the book. That instead of fight or flight I freeze. Just because I don't show outward symptoms doesn't mean I'm faking it. You can't fake having depression or anxiety.

Hi all,
New member in need of guidance and support and basically to find my happiness again. I have a daughter who is my breath of fresh air and my reason for holding on to the my small thread of happiness. i am her hero and she has unconditional love for me which is a feeling that keeps a real smile on my face as opposed to a drawn on one. I have been on anti-depressants for a little over 4 years after experiencing my first anxiety attack. All stemming from past family history and the break up of my past relationship with my daughters mum ( who surprisingly is the driving force behind me finding myself again) She is happy and has moved on and is engaged, i am happy for her as she deserves the world. guess the problem is that i am holding on to the small amount of happiness i once experienced and finding it hard to let go and move on with a healthy lifestyle . i don't know if want to get into my past family history just now but i can advise that my childhood had multiple contributing factors as to why i am not happy. I apologise if my thread is a little confusing and cryptic... basically i feel as though i don't deserve to be on anti-depresants and in my own point pf view feel as though i am weak for seeking help to find happiness and don't want to spiral down the dark hole of chronic depression. i am no where near that stage and don't want to ever be near the edge. 
thanks for listening
 
Happy Friday :)

A few months ago I could see myself slipping back into depression, so I went to the GP to get a mental health plan. Now I am regretting ever seeking help as everything I have tried does not seem to work which frustrates me and makes me angry inside.
 I see both a psychologist and my GP every few weeks but in reality I don’t know why I bother they both must think I am a drama queen and wasting their time it is not like they listen to me anyway. And my psychologist even told me that I am choosing to walk in depression (which annoyed me because I know that it is not true)
I tried meds a few weeks ago but had a bad reaction to them and I am not allowed to try anything else until 4 to 5 weeks after my last dose.
 This is the first time I ever reached out to get medical attention for my depression and follow through with the treatment plan, but now I am regretting it as I feel it has triggered my anxiety more than anything. I faced an 18 month battle of depression on and off and won once before without any help. Even though this depressive episode has only been for the last few months some reason it feels different and kind of worse as I can no longer cry anymore but really feel like I need to cry
 I know I need help to get through this depressive episode but when I do reach out for help no one listens to me. And they say I am choosing to walk in depression. I faced this battle once before and won without any help and I know I can do it again.

Hi everyone,
I've just recently fallen into another one of what I've named ""bad patches,"" where a trigger pushes me into a month or two of lethargy, low mood and anxiety (more so than usual). It's not all day every day, because I can be distracted, but it's a general feeling of grey with days of true sadness. Last week I was really foggy in the mind and absolutely lethargic (could have been down to sleep deprivation) and when I saw a psychologist she said I was exhibiting symptoms of depression. It's never been called this before, and I'm not sure how I feel about it. 
This week I'm coming out of the fog and seem to be thinking a bit clearer, but with that has come this paralysing fear because I know that I have to face life again. It's as if I want to hide behind the sadness and lethargy so I can just stay in bed and not face up everyday. It makes me really hate myself and feel like a coward. I wanted to know if anybody else experiences this. There's this voice in my head that's telling me that I'm a fake, and that I just need to get over it and stop being weak because it clearly wasn't anything serious. The problem is that instead of listening to that voice and pulling myself out of it I just retreat further into an anxious state. I am confused about what's going on- it just seems so layered and complicated.

 First off context: I come from a family with a history of mental illness - anxiety and depression. My dad died recently and I had severe anxiety attacks after this - probably as a result. So bad that my therapist said she almost wanted to hospitalise me!  I went on meds and they made a small difference. I took a month or so off work and got myself together again through exercise and mindfulness.  Am off them now and no panic attacks. But I do have  physiological symptoms of anxiety all day...no spiralling,crippling worries and negativity just the underlying physical / mental symptoms - heart palpitations numbness mild dissociation mind racing ahead. Nothing triggers it - no reason behind it.  I can't focus and I wake very often at 3am with this insane feeling...it goes on and on. I get no sleep and I  am lost in a racing mind unable even to read, listen to music plan, the day properly or relax.
My husband can't understand me and is angry at me for not showing affection and not connecting with him.  He often says he can't cope anymore because I don't smile and show him any love and is on the verge of leaving. Fair enough.  I tend to get angry but then I blame myself. ( I come from a family where there was a lot of anger between my parents - they were cruel to each other and little love was shown and displayed between them Or to us. As a result  I'm not good at affection and openly expressing my love) I hold everything back from him around how I am feeling because I fear the conflict and what it will do to me emotionally. 
I really hate myself at the moment. I blame myself for relationship problems, I feel like a failure because of my anxiety, think im stupid and worthless with no talent at all, I hate that I can't get my act together and blame myself for all the problems we have with our children - their learning and development (youngest son is bombing in school we are not sure what's wrong with him) . Of course I blame myself for this - it's all my fault as I took some medication for a health condition when I was pregnant And it probably affected his capacity for learning.  I think I'm erratic and disorganised and volatile and selfish ...and not a good person who has nothing to offer anyone. I can't think of any good qualities I have that make me proud of who I am. 
 I hate myself even more for being so selfish when there are others on this forum who are struggling terribly with distressing experiences far worse than my stupid selfish ones

I am new to this forum, and have considered seeing a doctor to get on a mental health plan which I may still do, but as I am such an independent person I thought I would try this first.
As like most of you on here, I have my good days and my bad days. 
Previously in life I have made some pretty awful and embarrassing decisions, which I block out most of the time and a rush of guilt and shame swoops through me when I think of it too much. I am nearly fully healed of those 'bad' decisions with learning to forgive myself.. but from those hard times has brought depression and anxiety into my life, and I can relate to those feelings when I am going through something completely different scenario wise.
My most recent head space, in the last 8-10 months has been that I don't feel 'alive', I don't feel 'well' (anxiety) but I do not have anxiety attacks, I more so feel sad about myself and my life, as what I want to achieve is in reach but it's not the right time. I have been working from home the last year and a half (not for health reasons, just a gig I scored) and I have sadly put in 13 kilos of weight. Of course, this would bring anyone down naturally, by not being happy with their physical self.
I have no career ambition or goals, I have dipped my toes in a lot of different jobs and hobbies, but nothing sticks. I know I am much better off in life than a lot of people in this world, but that isn't a curable thought. I feel lost like I have nothing to work towards, I don't have physical interaction with people at work which I miss, but if I was to give up my job I would not be able to find an income remotely close to what I have now. 
I'm trying to find a thirst, a passion for life, to work hard, lose weight and have something to look forward to doing on the weekends/week nights rather than plotting through the days and getting sad and uninviting thoughts in my head.
In the past 3-4 months I have re-assessed who I spend my time with, friends wise and have had some friendships break down, but I have always been the type of person to know and love everyone and I have always felt the same back from other people. Now my time is spent with quality friends and not quantity, I feel as though that's created some sadness as that has never been the way it was for me, even though I know it is much better to have quality than quantity relationships.
 I'm hoping someone can give me some friendly advice.

 Hi all,
I hope sharing my story will help me to express something that words have always really failed to do.
I'm 61. My messed up thinking about myself and relationships led to poor choices that were destructive; choices that hurt others and which, in the end, cost me my first marriage. There is a huge disconnect between my life as a health care professional and my personal, internal life. I'm told I'm good with people; that I can talk to others easily & interact in a caring, consultative way, with good communication that contributes good outcomes for clients. Yet I have no friends. I have no one (other than my current wife) who is close to me (and even there I feel a lack of understanding). I must send out non-verbal ""stay away"" messages, because rarely do family, or people I might wish to call friends, initiate contact with me. Life can be very lonely. Perhaps I'm afraid that others will see the messed up fraud that I am and I subconsciously push them away.
For me, depression is like home
being a small, dark room with walls lined with thick cotton wool that has
pieces of broken glass embedded in it. Somewhere there is a light switch that
would go a long way to helping me find my way and avoid the pain from the
broken glass, but the darkness makes it pretty much impossible to find. At the
same time the cotton wool muffles the soundness of my thoughts and choices and also the voices of anyone offering help or direction. And all those thoughts seem to want to
get my attention at the same time. Everything is just a mumbling jumble of
painful thought, and no one seems to be able to hear when I call for help. I can sometimes break
free from that bad place for a few hours to go to work where most people
wouldn’t know anything is wrong, where you can trick yourself and others into
thinking that everything is ok, but it’s exhausting keeping up the act of being
normal; I can put on a good mask make it look like everything is OK. At the end of the day, though, you have to go back to my ""room"" – back to that place of
confusion and pain – which also doesn’t make sense because any rational
thinking person would choose to stay away. Depression isn’t rational. I'm not really able to be explain it with words!

I've seen counsellors/psychologists. My GP has me on an antidepressant which gives a little help, but life is still flat, without purpose & full of guilt. Some days I just wish I didn't have to wake up and do it all again. I just ache both inside & out.

Hey all, I'm a 44 year old male that has just hit the wall. Nothing is good enough, tired, headaches, frustrations, wondering how people feel about me and if I'm doing the right thing, looking over my shoulder consistently to find nothing there. I had to walk out of a Meeting at work the other day to cry and then 1hour later I was good again. It feels like 10% of my brain is telling me all the good stuff and then the other 90% kicks in and takes over and feeds me with all of the confusion that I have now. I suspect I have been depressed for years but it hasn't been until the last week where everything has started to multiply that has started to scare me. I have a doctors appointment this afternoon but cant get into a psychiatrist until next week. I will continue to read these forums and the information on this web site as it has been a great help to this point in time. Why does this happen to somebody like me that has a great family, job and in general a great life and really don't have anything to be stressed about. I don't understand it but here's hoping I learn to deal with it. Until next time everybody take care.

Hi everyone,
My name is Nick and I'm 27.  It's the first time I use this forum.
 I was a little hesitant at first until I recently found that it might be a little too much for just my partner to handle my issues all by herself.
 I have had depression/anxiety since 2005 but things'd gone on and off until recently.  I have seen a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist too.
At the moment, I'm struggling particularly as I really want to give up on my PhD programme in medical field.  However, I do realise it could just be my avoidance trait.  As I have had the exact same feeling when I was jobless or doing jobs which supposed to have lower stress level.  I also found it really hard to concentrate in my reading.  I choose many ways to proscastinate.  I even want to take an intermission.
As an Asian, as explained by my psychiatrist, I have vulnerabilities in seeking approval from others (this has internalised in me as my father has been telling me I'm not good enough more than half of my life).  My other issue is I always need a sense of success to keep me going, in order for me to feel that I'm worthwhile as a person.
However, this is my main problem as a PhD student.  Sometimes, you don't necessarily see the end of the tunnel.
I am so close to giving up.  Today I have had a panic attack after receiving the email from my supervisor asking if I've had returned after a whole week of ""day offs"" due to my viral infection.  I told my gf how I felt so worthless.  Then all of a sudden, it became the first time I ever cry at work (or at the sports facility)  as a man (although I always feel miserable).
I feel so helpless and I really need someone to talk to.  Just to see if any of you out there have had similar issue at work with depression/anxiety.  How did you overcome? 
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Nick

I'd been doing well coping lately. Been off meds for a bit, been able to bounce back after minor episodes. But now, my anxiety has spiked and am feeling hopeless and worthless because one of my housemates doesn't like me. Maybe I wouldn't mind if I didn't overhear her whispering about me to someone else lately. Or if she didn't leave passive aggressive messages on the house whiteboard.  
I feel trapped. My partner is great, he understands my concerns and tries to help me feel better, but he's able to just laugh off her little spiteful comments and actions. I just sit here and dwell on them, and feel scared to leave our room. We are looking to move, but it just doesn't happen fast enough for me. I still have to cope with this until we find somewhere. I feel like a stupid teenager, even though I'm 35. Don't want to go running back home only after a few months of finally being away from them, even though part of me really wants to just run away from all this.
I think therapy could help me... but it's incredibly difficult for me to choose someone just from a website or a list. The last therapist I went to was ok, but I just didn't click with him and didn't feel like it was helping so I stopped going. I really wish I could still see the woman I had at uni, but I'm not a student anymore.

Why can one day start normal you feel happy.Then all a sudden a cluster of small things that don't go to plan cause you to breakdown.Then you obsess or over think everything and somehow you make it seem like its all your fault.Today i wanted the day to be perfect and a few tiny minor issues have resulted in me hysterically crying and wanting to run away from everyone and everything.I have been diagnosed with social Anxiety and i have it given a good fight for 7years  without medication .But now i feel like it has just manifested into something so big and its starting to consume every waking hour of the day and in fact even in my sleep i grind my teeth with the stress.I'm the happy carefree mum of 2 at school that has a fulltime successful hairdressing business 2 dogs a cat a husband with his own business and i just manage it perfectly and carefree and never get mad or frustrated........yeah right!I've become a master now at covering up the real me but now i finally feel like i shouldn't that it's making things worse everyday living up to everyone else's expectations of me what they tell me i look like from the outside calm and carefree , organized instead or being true to whom i am and admitting i can't fix this on my own anymore.I need the help of medication i already see a psychologist but i know im even fake when i talk to her.I don't want to be the one on meds i want to be the one that can cope.How do i get it right in my head that i need this extra help and not fear taking medication , not fearing the very thing that could take this  sadness, frustration and fear away.

Hello all,First time here, 50 years old, been treated for depression for many years, medication since 1999, tried a few classes of drug treatment, . Seen many psychologists, social workers a few clinical psychiatrists and have a terrible history of not coping.I am on my third marriage and the writing is on the wall, I also can not hold jobs, too much pressure or weird anxiety due to bosses peer pressure, I self medicate with xxxx beer nightly approx. 6 only per night now. have gone off my meds due to been psychologically castrated, I tried to run my own small business but could not keep the customers even though I was good at my job, just found it all too hard and cringed when phone rang consequently now bankrupt. .Great now I am a loser too boot!Moved closer too the ocean to allow healing I thought but feel lost in the society and life direction. I am beginning to wonder why what and what for, I know I do not fit in social circles with successful people because I have not achieved the neighbourhood status and have become meek and disillusioned. I feel no joy and sick of the usual she will be right mate attitude. I have tried cognitive therapy and mind tricks and so on and so on and so on.My question is to those who can identify with my true  electronic open heart surgery "" inspection"" what can I do realistically when I not only feel like a failure I have become one with out a doubt, even when I choose to think differently those dark feelings still seem to rule and when I challenge them I find its all my fault, my perception my inadequacies and my wrong thinking. Doctors come and go like the ocean tides as their training placements has been met, pleading your case is an effort and a burden to relive. Is their help? Is the psychotropic drugs prescribed the answer, is their a real chemical imbalance or must I wear blinkers like a race horse so I can function in the system and society.I feel Mad as a hatter with out the magic tea...that might be me problem after all.look forward to meeting some one who I can connect with as this is really my last resort I guess! "" no that's not blackmail""Cheers, Mick

Hi,
I don't reallyknow where to begin. ....i have struggled with depression on and off for years.  At least about 15.....i have been on and off medication and am currently meant to be taking some but have to go back and get a script from my gp. 
I am usually happy to take my meds but sometimes i get sick of them. ....
For as long as i can remember i wanted to get married have children and be a stay at home mum.  After 4 years of trying we finally got pregnant with my beautiful daughter.  I finished work and have been a stay at home mum ever since.  (Just over 2 years)
 I adore my daughter and wouldn't change her for the world. 
I guess the best to describe how i feel is trapped.  I have multiple layers of guilt.  I feel guilty for not being a working mum,  i would feel guilty if i worked.  I feel bad that i don't get all the house work done and feel like i don't spend enough time with bub. 
I am exactly where i want to be but still miserable.  I feel like my husband doesn't  care or get how i feel.  Some days all i can manage is feeding my daughter and i.....

Hi all
I am new to the forums and have been reading them for a while but have been to too nervous to respond. I have 3 young adult children and a grandson who I adore. I work as a nurse in what can be a very stressfull environment. I haven't been at work for the last 2 months as I have been in hospital with a depressive phase of my bipolar. I got out of hospital yesterday and have today found out from my case manager that I have been diagnosed with borderline personality as well. 
I'm it hard to work out how I can be diagnosed with this while I am depressed. I have a great GP who is so supportive and a case manager in the community.  I have been assigned to a new psychiatrist who I'm not keen on but am willing to give him a try. 
Even with this support I feel like I am struggling all the time. I have no friends and have disowned my family. Does anyone have any suggestions
hope you all have a happy day

Hello I'm a newbie to BB but not to depression having suffered from depression/anxiety for most of my life. I have been on medication for 6 years now which has been a life saver and I think will also be a life-long commitment to staying well. I am a high achiever, I am a mummy to a gorgeous 2.5 year old boy who I love to bits and who can also drive me mad, you know how it is. I work in academia, 4 days/week. In general I manage all the general day to day of life, work, housestuff, child minding etc. I have a supportive partner etc. And yet my depression or anxiety are always just 'there'. I have had years of therapy and had traumatic  teenage years caused by a mum who herself was and still is seriously mentally ill. I now have minimal contact with her as a way of surviving. My psychiatrist says that my brain has simply wired itself to be this way eg thru trauma and genetics but I hate feeling like this. I am going through a depressive stage at the moment and I often just can't put my finger on what the trigger is. Life just seems like a constant balancing act which most of the time feels like it takes a huge effort to maintain. I was lying in bed last night feeling terrible and thought reaching out to BB would help, and reading the stories on here have been an amazing way to just think 'oh my god I'm not alone'. I am just interested in how others feel they manage the day to day, and if you are any good at recognising your triggers. I know the usual take time for yourself and so on, but then feeling guilty through mother guilt is so self-sabotaging too! We are thinking of moving overseas back to my husband's home country where I have lived before and am actually feeling ok about (well actually very up and down but am open to), but I worry about not having support like I have set up here with access to my psychiatrist, and I don't even know how it works with medication....I assume people in Ireland take antidepressants but would I have access to the same medication? Anyway just interested to read some more ideas.

Hi guys,
 

First time for everything.
 

Never thought I will have to reach out. Never thought that
I, guy who’s seen it all, has been through a lot with his head up, who has been
to hell and back, could be posting on a forum related to depression.
 


Long story short –I’m in my late 20’s, had a very good
social life, decent job with good income (bit of stress at work but hey, every
job is like that isn’t it), beautiful and gold hearted fiancé, living in a nice
apartment etc etc. I don’t think I need anything and I’ve very comfortable. Bit
of a family history with abusive alco father but I don’t think it overly
bothers me now – I have moved out so my contact with family is very limited (my
choice).
 


Over the last few weeks / months I’ve just been feeling down
a lot. Constantly tired, never want to get out of bed, can’t be stuffed doing
anything or seeing anyone. My hobbies (which consists of playing video games
and painting miniature models) no longer brings me joy (quite the opposite – it
actually pisses me off and gets me frustrated). I enjoy doing what I’m doing
for a living – I just can’t be bothered most of the times. My sex life is
semi-existent but only because of me – if it was up to her (and if I was
co-operative) we would have sex every day. My friends – long story with some of
them – I just can’t be bothered seeing because I know they will say something
that I will take personally and that will piss me off. I thought about joining
a gym and going for runs – just too tired with a lack of motivation. 
Constantly
blaming myself and thinking that I’m just a problem for some people. Would love
to tell a lot of people to F OFF but I feel like it will ruin the group we have
going on (I’m only “friends” with some of them because of the group). I
sometimes drink but not often (maybe once a fortnight) and I don’t get very drunk. I’ve
done a lot of drugs when I was younger but nothing for last few years. Quit
smoking few months ago as well.
 

I’m definitely not happy. It almost feels like I don’t want
to be happy. I don't even know what I should do to be happy - I'm not looking for it - I'm avoiding it. Did I think about necking myself few times over last days? Sure
did – I know I would never do it, I just have thoughts of it.
 

Anyone in similar situation? Should I see somebody? Should I
just eat a spoon of cement?

Hi, It said to share as that might help dealing with emotions so I'm trying it.The job I had was hell, about 10 hours of un-paid over-time a week, constant stress, constant bereating from management that what was being done with a team of 7 can't be done with a team of 1. a few months before new year I finally got an apprentice to help me out, but yeah teaching takes more time so no quick result. Anyway I put up with it because I couldn't find another job and we'd bought a home in Byford and finally adopted 2 little girls.Then in February my partner and I were in a car crash, the car was totalled but we only had a little whiplash. Damage was beyond our insurance cover since it was an old car they pay out wasn't even enough to buy a new one.And then 2 maybe 3 weeks later the GM pulls me aside and tells me that they're getting rid of me in favor of my aprentice yipee. At first I was kinda happy out of the hell hole. Then the financial problems hit home.I've been job hunting every since and send out between 20 and a 100 applications a day and receive dozens of rejections each week. Since it's been going down hill.Every idea I've had to save my familie has been shot down by banks, government, possible employers. nobody seems to want to deal with me at all.Even centerlink won't help us because my partner is not on minimum wage she earns just enough to pay our morgage but hey we need food and pay bills as well. And I got told very firmly by centerlink that they won't help us as long as we have our home. So we need to lose everything before they'll even give us a break.my car is gone, my job is gone, and every week something else seems to happen. my laptop dies, on of our girls gets sick and needs treatment, I get injured,it's constantly going on and I'm not holding on very well anymore.I'm a lesbian woman with chronic illness and chronic pain, and nobody wants to have anything to do with me,and I can't seem to be strong anymore I haven't stopped crying since I woke up today.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi everyone.
I am on 3 weeks of my meds and would like to say, it does get better. 
I have been on these meds before a few years ago so they have kicked in pretty much straight away, I am slowly becoming my old self again.
i had a mental/nervous break down a few weeks back, my whole body crashed on me, I was then diagnosed with depression and anxiety. But with the help of good doctors and my family and friends I am slowly getting back to myself.

I have just joined here.. Having a badish day but I had to share what just happened to me to me just shows how the simple things can become overwhelming when depressed.

I was reading some of the posts and when I went to the top of the page I saw 'Home >Connect with others > Online forums' the Online forum part was not clickable so the only way I could work out how to get back to the forum was hit the back button after doing this a few time I burst into tears yes no clickable link seemed to mean that much to me I am sure some will understand that here. After reading a few more posts I realised just below the button for the 'Community rules' is the clickable link back to the forums well when I realised that I started laughing so as I started writing this I was both crying and laughing as well as think damn your crazy. Sorry just had to share that depression if you have not had it you are not going to believe the things that effect you :)

Hey, I, umm, new here and really don't know what i'm doing. I'm 25 female and been having a tough time. Had a break down at work 3 or 4 years or so ago and been struggling since. For 3 years I was seeing Psychologists, Psychiatrists,GP, getting medicated and all that but no one seems to really want to listen to what I say. I keep getting fed lines like ""You're young"", ""you've got your whole life ahead of you"", ""Your pretty"". I keep feeling like i'm getting dismissed a lot. Yes i'm small, yes i'm built ""petite"", yes i'm young but that shouldn't mean i should get dismissed, does it? I've read the Psych reports on me and one Psych said I ""chose"" this and the other said I ""overreact"". Half the time they don't even give me enough time to arrange my thoughts, and how to word things properly. I don't know what I can do. I've been giving it my all, its taking a lot of strength and will out of me and i keep getting stone walled. I try and i try and i try and nothing happens... I'm finding it hard to continue on, i'm struggling to survive with all this stone walling and deaf ears around me. I'm standing on my last leg and I'm in need of help. Can anyone help me?beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

 I have been suffering from depression since I was 13, I am now 25. It hasn't always been a struggle, I have tried to manage it as best as I can. Done the meds thing, I see a psychiatrist... but it never really goes away. The dark, the negative thinking, the stress, the anxiety... it is always there waiting on the sidelines, looking for an opportunity to take over when you're vulnerable and down. I have always been a very private person, I don't reach out well to others, I don't want to burden others with my problems or let others into the jumbled thoughts that bounce around in my head. Its pretty hard trying to deal with it on your own, who do you turn to when you're having a really off day? I decided to go off my anti depressants two weeks ago because the side effects were becoming to much and I had gained alot of weight in a short amount of time, right now though my emotions are stuck on a wild roller coaster ride and I feel my mood slipping into that dark pool, that horrible darkness deep within your soul. Going through a bit of a hard time right now and trying to muster all my strength to overcome it and see the light on the other side.

I really ave no idea where to start with this so I will try to be as clear as I can. I have suffered from depression all my life, however, I have managed to function and hold down a job and a relationship. However, over the last few years my ability to cope has become less and less and I ended up getting divorced (that's another long story) and changing jobs. I am in a new relationship but I feel a constant burden. It seems that nothing I do is right and we have started to argue a lot I do not think it is my fault but I ave been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and a generalised anxiety disorder so intellectually I recognise that I am probably not being reasonable but I cannot make the emotional connection - it is like things are either blank inside or wound up so tight I could explode at any moment. I just do not know what to do and what would be reasonable behaviour and it scares the hell out of me.
I am off work at the moment as I try new medication but there is a constant tension and it seems that for whatever reason either my behaviour or something else a history has built up in my relationship which means that as soon as anything happens it is instantly attributed to my depression, with comments such as - I cannot talk to you when you are like this. I just can't tell if this is me being unreasonable or whether this has become a habit or an excuse. 
 Does anyone have any experience of how to deal with this and maybe have some form of benchmark that can help them know when they are reasonable and unreasonable - I just can't believe it is me all the time or is this something I have to get used to as one of the things that have to be dealt with whilst suffering from depression.

Ok so i have no idea where to start but I'm struggling to get back on track after an accident at work ended with me losing half my index finger. I've been fighting the depression from many years ago that's come back after it.
Whilst my recovery is going well, I'm so scared that i won't be able to do the job I love doing so well. I can't do my hobby to take my mind off it as I race remote controlled cars and it requires my index finger as a vital part to work the throttle. My mate is trying to push me to go bike riding and go to the gym, but I just can't get the motivation to keep it going. The big thing is that i feel like I've stalled in my recovery and it's not going as quickly and i want/ expect it too.
I'm just completely lost and don't feel like myself all of a sudden and I don't know what to do to get through it.

Argg! Why is everything so hard! 
Year in year out I've worked my hardest to be positive, hard working, motivated. I've worked a great job (which after 15 years I was retrenched from due to outsourcing) and did my best to see it as a blessing and an opportunity to retrain. 
So at 8 months old I put my child in daycare 2 days a week and went back to school and got my cert 4 in fitness. And what a joke that has been. I hoped it would give me the ability to work the hours my child is asleep so I could spend the days with her. But getting shifts late enough so it doesn't interfere is non existent and most people seem to want a ""cheap"" trainer. And if you work for a gym they want you to do sales. I couldn't sell to save myself, I hate sales with a passion, so it appears I've completely wasted my time. 
On top of that, I have been training people I know just to keep myself current but I feel like I'm banging my head against a brick wall. People just aren't dedicated to their goals. They spend more time making excuses than listening to what I actually have to say,  And it doesn't seem to matter what angle I take to help I've wasted my time and effort investigating new training methods. So what does that say about how effective a trainer I am?
I'd rather spend all day in my room by myself (aside from my daughter). I have read about depression including not wanting to feel alone but I rarely feel lonely and often get annoyed and anxious about having to actually spend time with people. I know this isn't healthy and push myself to have activities to do every day but it's causing me more frustration everyday. I feel so demotivated to do anything. I've lost passion for most everything. It's driving me spare. 
I want to be a good mum and a role model but I can't even keep my house in a decent state. 
Why can't I work out how to make something work. 
Ive tried writing down things I'm grateful for everyday for 6 weeks. It make zero difference.
what the heck do I do? I'm so lost.

So I've been lashing out lately (well probably for quite a while now), like in sort of a blind rage for no reason - or at least the smallest little things will trigger it.  I just can't seem to help myself.  I just feel like I want people to think for themselves and stop bothering me.  I just don't want to have to deal with people in general.  I don't return phone calls or emails. I seem to self sabotage everything and push people away.  How did this happen?  
I don't feel angry all time, mostly I just feel flat and heavy - I have been attributing it to laziness and lack of motivation.  I used to know happiness and lightness once, but I remember this feeling of disconnection and flatness from way back when I was in primary school.
My husband and partner for the last 20 years confronted me last night about my short temper and lack of patience... so I googled for the first time ""Why am I so angry?"".  One of the first pages I came across said some things that rang true: Frustration, not being able to be happy, lashing out, being withdrawn and disconnected.  Apparently, these are all symptoms of depression.  I couldn't believe it, I'm not depressed, surely not!  I'm optimistic and not a negative type of person, how can I be depressed?  I have a girlfriend who suffers from depression and I have never been able to relate to what she goes through on a daily basis. 
How can I be depressed? I'd always thought that the ""D"" word was some peoples way to get attention. To think that I was depressed was not right, surely. I don't wan't to be the attention of anyone, I just want to be left alone to do my own thing. 
 So I casually mentioned it all to my husband this morning, this ""D"" word.  He was very sweet and gave me a cuddle.  But then, when I dropped him off at work.  He said to me I should be grateful that I have a son and a husband that loves me and a roof over my head.  Things could be so much worse.  I know this, but all it did was make me feel worse, much worse.  I now feel guilty!  I cried the whole way home and most of the day.  So here I am... trying to find my way to the lightness.

my moods and depression is ruining my relationship.  All I'm doing it pushing my partner further and further away because I don't know how to deal with it all- and he has had enough of trying to help me that I just cant talk to him about it anymore because I know even though he loves and cares for me he cant deal with my problems anymore. 
Because we cant talk about it without it turning into a fight I cant convince him that my problems stem from me constantly letting him down and feeling like a useless sack of shit because of letting him down.  
I know I should walk away and let him live his life before I ruin it anymore- but I just cant make myself as I know he is the only thing keeping me slightly sane and giving me something to love and want to be better for.   
Not quite sure where to go from here other then back to the doctor tomorrow and hope this time I can get the help I need and not quit as soon as I feel slightly better.  
I just hope he will still be there as its getting less and less likely he will keep outing up with my shit!

The feeling I have today is nothing new. just existing.
normal childhood, struggled in school (adhd) dropped out to persue my swimming career. It was the one thing I could do good! Swimming and lifesaving was my life and entered a career as a professional beach life guard in early 20s. That's when it all started. Experienced a case of discrimination being the only female on the team and over a year of severe bullying. Stood up for myself but at the end all I ended up with was my confidence and belief in who I am shattered. This was the start of my ""depression"" and health issues. 
At the time I was lucky to meet my husband and marry and now have 2 kids. It has not been smooth sailing. Husband worked away at sea for 3 months at a time.(at home for 3) Many bumps along the way, always being the one to pick up the pieces. 
Loosing my dad to heart failure and dealing with it alone as my husband was at sea. Then 4 years ago I was in serious heart failure ... And my husband was away. I'm just tiered and couldn't even be gravely ill without worrying about everyone else. I survived my heart failure. I had to because I have tue beautiful boys who need me. 
Realising a relationship like the one we had could not continue, we immigrated to Australia to a shore based job in rural wa. We have been here almost 20 months and it has been hard. Although my husband now comes home every night, he is tiered and withdrawn and if I speak to him it is no more than 5 minutes a day. It's as if he is out on the ocean and not home at all! 
I have given up my home, where I had a job(swim teacher at my home pool) and everything I knew(good medical, which I now have to fly 2 hours to get to) and my family. Life was no peaches there but I had a life. 
Now in a small rural town, and nothing is working for me. I am not able to teach swimming cause my qualification is not recognized here. I have no filter when it comes articulating myself and I ruined the other love of my life which is working with children in scouts. I struggle to make friends, yet I would be your best friend. 
i just want to be me and be accepted. And loved.

Hi all,
I'm not really sure where to begin with this, I'll try to be brief. Mid twenties caucasian male. In the past 2 years I've dealt with: an abusive relationship, half of my closest friends walking out on me (I was a variable, not a cause), quitting work, failed musical projects, car accident, sleeping in a kitchen, being poor & doing odd jobs for $$, best friend (my cat) being killed.
I've fought my way through all that rubbish, set up a business, got really fit, started doing yoga, tried new music projects and moved away.
Now I'm sitting at my new house, hating everything. I moved into this lonely, forsaken place and it just hit me all of a sudden how pointless my struggle was and made me question the validity of my goals. My reality has distorted to the point where I have no aspirations anymore, the idea of interacting with others is contemptuous, and all music sounds cacophonous and mocking to my ears.
Every time I try to motivate myself a part of me pushes forward and systematically attacks my intentions and goals.
I have had depression and anxiety since I was about 7-8 years old, seen psychologists before, I'm not on meds and I don't want to be. I have enough self destructive tendencies without furthering my drug dependance. My general distrust of others inhibits me from seeing a GP, so I thought I'd vent here and see if anyone can relate.
 Thank you for your time.

Hi everyone
Let me start with my story.
2 weeks ago I started to have health anxiety due to something I thought was in my throat (nothing there) then it got worse from there, I started feeling horrible every day I could push through and do everything I needed to for myself and my 3 beautiful children, then within the last few days I couldn't do anything I mean anything I could barely walk, other then go to the toilet, I had to get my partner to take my kids to school, I had to have my sister stay with my me a few days cause all I wanted to do was sleep. 
Last night I ended up going to hospital cause I knew this wasn't me I thought there was something wrong with me they done chest X-ray and blood tests but it all came back normal so they dr referred me to mental health, which when I was talking to the dr I figured out I have depression, I have suffered depression before but nothing this bad, I adrupltly stopped taking my meds last time as I fell pregnant, they have put me on new meds the same as I was on before as they helped a lot last time, and am also on sleeping pills as I have trouble staying asleep which is making me tired during the day. 
I would love to hear back from people that have suffered depression like this before, and any tips on helping me recover, I have mental health psychologist come out to my house and see me and they are putting my dosage up within the week,.
thanks and hope to her par back from people soon

Feeling really, really down tonight.
I think one of the hardest things about depression is that often it just keeps coming back whether you like it or not. Sometimes this makes me feel like a bit of a failure, but then the rational side of me knows that it's not something to be ashamed of. However, when depression keeps coming back I find it harder and harder to talk about it with the people I care. I worry that I will end up sounding like a broken record, and that everyone will be sick of me and my moods. So I'm really glad that I've found beyond blue - I feel like I can talk about my feelings without worrying about over-burdening someone. 
Another thing that's really hard about recurrent depression is that it's just so damn exhausting. I'm so tired of trying to keep a brave face and battling on even though on the inside I'm really struggling to keep it together. I hate that every night I just end up crying alone in my bed, after pretending like everything is ok all day. My life has some really great things going on in it, but for whatever reason I just can't enjoy it as I feel so hopeless and so alone, and the future from where I'm standing looks so bleak. 
At least the one constant in life is change, and I'm hoping that things can't stay this way forever. In the mean time, I guess it's just one day at a time...

Hi i'm stuggling with feeling flat. Flat as a tyre.
 I suffer with another mental illness which go's hand in hand with depression. Due to my medication I no longer have energy and lack motivation to do anything much at all. I used to have large groups of friends which I slowly lost due to my mental illness and depression interfering. Now days I just feel flat with no interest in much at all in life without many friends. Also this flat feeling quiet often leaves me feeling as if the things I have to say are uninteresting or that I don't have much conversation. My self esteem has taken a great knock when I lost friends. Also not working atm has had me find myself without purpose.
Is there support groups I can join to build new friendships? What do I do about feeling flat? how can I improve myself esteem?

I think my anxiety and stress stems from emotional and verbal bullying. I took several tests online and am told I have depression / anxiety and possible paranoia. I also need therapy and counselling. That sucks. A few years ago I would've never thought I would be in this position, but I am.
To be honest, even though I've been hurt a lot this past year, I feel it's kinda my fault too. I don't have many friends, and can never find (and keep) a best friend. Last time I found love I left it for career (or new school, should I say). I'm starting to think this is all my fault, and it really really sucks.
Bottom line is, I'm lonely and I compensate my loneliness with imaginary scenes in my head, even though they'll never come true. Sometimes I compensate it with astrology readings, always searching for something positive, thus wasting incredible amounts of time. I need to stop. I wish my mind will shut down, like a Power Off button on the computer.
I'm a mess.
I'm a mess and I need help.

Hey bb friends,
 It's nearly 1 in the morning and I just sent myself into a stress frenzy. I had a meltdown at work this week and once I'd calmed down I realised I really wasn't happy with the 'support' from my supervisor. Everything started to look up after that except I have to go and see a doctor and get their recommendation of what to do to move forward. I am partly relieved because I've been trying to get the help I need for ages but I'm also concerned. It's also horrible because my week was going so much better after that and I was doing so much better but I barely got to enjoy it; now I'm wracked with stress and panic because I'm still in a really bad position. No matter how much I do to get ahead it's barely a dent and it's so hard to keep persisting. I feel like I'm almost exhausted and no one will have my back. The hardest part is I have to be happy for the weekend for my boyfriend's birthday. I really don't know how to dig out of it all, there's just way too much. I get sad wondering if maybe I deserve it.

Going on 13 years of suffering and now with 2 children and a husband being affected I am sadder than ever that I still haven't beaten this depression.
 I have a great life and nothing bad happens to me and I have no reason to be depressed. Antidepressants haven't worked for me and the last 3 years of therapy haven't either.
I think I'm too lazy to be better because all I do is mope around and stress out over insignificant things. I never do anything to help the situation because I hate myself too much to be nicer to myself. 
Should I just suck it up and start faking happiness so as not to burden my family any more? I wish I had a medicine that could numb me completely so I was never sad or angry.

I work in management with a difficult team and intense deadlines. I feel sick in the stomach as I pull into work.  Just turned 50 and have made constant poor choices and achieved little. I know this is very ungrateful of me but it is how I see myself. To top it off I am not sleeping. The anxiety is constant but be is at its worse after miidnight where my heart is racing and pounding.

Dear friendsThought it was time I got back online & shared what's happened & apologize for not being around to welcome relatively new members. I had hoped this year I would do a lot of healing. But life can be taken off you. My husband who's been in remission from leukemia for nearly  five years we've had devastating news that it's back & acute & aggressive.Things have to move fast. Hospitalized from this time onwards for approx 9 months of intensive chemo & bone marrow transplant. Not a good outlook but somehow do I stop my mind thinking of the terrible journey ahead. Telling the kids was so hard. I feel broken in pieces.  Try to be managing in front of him but sit up & cry all night thinking how will I get through this? He's just 40 & I hate life it's torn apart & Im alone to support everyone when I'm in pieces &  queston can an manage this journey alone.Also the civil case against the Priest who abused me is on my mind. The church have suspended him pending investigation. I haven't even written my statement so lawyers on both sides waiting on me.And how do I get through all this & give my kids as much support as possible, watch my husband deteriorate & visit him everyday not knowing if he will survive, get through a traumatic legal case about being drugged & raped as a kid and try act normal & strong & be the one who holds it all  together? I try to be humble, I try to think of all who face pain but right now I am on verge if tears always, have moments I think I know I'm only holding on for everyone else or I think I'd be suicidal. I'm tired of being told I'm strong. I have a he'll of a year in front of me & I feel like life has stopped, I'm numb yet I'm hurting deeply, I'm weak when I'm going to have to be so strong.  And I don't have any real practical support. Once people know they tend to stay away. I have no close friends & where & how am I going to get through this year. I don't  want to see my husband get sicker every day when he could die from his white cells being destroyed by chemo & infection or what if there's no donor or he doesn't respond to transplant? How do I relive the abuse & trauma I went through as a young girl by a Priest I trusted how do I get justice & can anything help give me justice? Money? That doesn't come close to redemption. My husband asked me to promise I'd keep going til I got some forms of justice.I am alone, terrified, no support.Friends-Neil, John.Geoff, GA  & all I need you.Maresbeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi Everyone,I'm very new to this forum, first post in-fact. I need to share what I've been going through and I thought this might be the place. If this is posted in the wrong place i'm sorry.I'm 34 and married to a very understanding woman whom I have three lovely kids with. I've lived with depression and anxiety since high school but have only been seeking help and received a formal diagnosis for the last 2 years or so. I started medication, reluctantly, last year with some results. I stopped feeling sad all the time, I didn't get angry at the drop of a hat and then bottle this anger up. However, something clicked in my head and went off the medication cold turkey last Christmas. It was unpleasant to say the least. I never really felt better after going off the meds but I lied to my concerned wife. I didn't want to tell her the only reason I went off the meds was because I was gaining weight. I reluctantly went back to my GP, with my wife, early this year and went back on medication....a new type...My doctor was working closely with me to help me through this. He has been really helpful. He sent me to a number of clinical psychologists and other psychologists. He believed I have bi-polar. Once again, reluctantly I went along...I stopped going to the physiologist the previous year because  I felt uncomfortable talking about things. Anyway, I went along to told that I didn't really have depression of any form at all that It was merely my personality with some anxiety and that he doesn't think medication will help. I came out of the appointment upset, angry and unsure of where to go and what to do.  I still feel that way....helpless and and hopeless sums up how I currently feel. I immediately went off my medication and havn't been near my GP since. I feel like an absolute idiot. Since going of the medication things have gone down hill yet I cant bring myself to admit this to my wife. I have a woman at work I talk to but I don't feel like I can continually talk to her as I don't want to overburden her.I needed to share this with the hope that talking to others about it might make me feel a little better.

Crying uncontrollably, trying to hide that from my husband as he gets so angry when I'm depressed. I'm continually told me & my mood wreck everything. That his life would be so much better if I wasn't in it, waiting formal dozen to work, got myself off my antidepressant at the beginning of the year but have crashed again after the ridiculously expensive & eventually ineffective ""natural"" paleo diet. I hate living like this

Hi there, I am looking for some unbiased feedback on my situation.
I am a happily married 24yo mum of 1 (mum of 2 in Jan 16). 
When I was 14 I was sexually abused by my step brother for a month whilst on a trial custody agreement with my Father and his new wife. Instead of confronting the issue, he sent me home to my mum. I have not dealth with this issue and it still effects me to this day, even though I can't verbalise how so, nor can I remember much of the incident. After 8 years of not acknowledging it, I did my own research on my state of mind and I landed on PTSD, depression and anxiety. 
I grew up with an unintentional tough love environment so I learned to cope but in my bad months/years I would be unmotivated, I would self sabotage, I would go every day with a lump in my throat feeling like I was a complete failure. I would feel sick but not actually be sick, I would be constantly irrational and inconsolable, crying at the drop of a hat some days and not even been able to utter a word on others. 
After becoming slightly independent at the age of 21 I felt more in control of my state ofmind, especially when I met and married my husband. My anxiety (not diagnosed professionally) was ever present but I was in control. But due to current circumstances I feel back at square one. This time I am worried as I have a 11 month old baby, a baby on the way and my husband to consider. I don't want to be an absent mum even though I'm present, I would never forgive myself. I know I will lose my husband if I don't make him understand or fix it. I feel myself slipping into a mood I can't shake, I know I'm slacking off on my duties but I can't bring myself to do them and whilst I want to leave the house and be pretty and motivated, I can't even bring myself to brush my hair every morning or brush my teeth once a week. My husband doesn't understand through no fault of his own but I feel so embarrassed and pathetic trying to explain it. I feel like I'm lying or exaggerating or I'm not explaining it right and I sound stupid. 
I just want to know that I'm not just a failed, unmotivated person and that maybe there is actually something wrong that I can't control or get rid of. 
My brain is so scattered I can't put two words together or stay on one train of thought. I don't know what to do.

I cry, i cry so much, i find a place to be alone and the tears come. In front of other people I hold it in, but alone I just let go. I have a great Dr, I am on medication that until recently worked fine, I see a psych, but then I only say a bit here and a bit there. I don't want them to know that I am frustrated, that I find dealing with my husband frustrating (he has dementia). I hardly sleep, 3 - 4 hours broken a night is becoming normal, I cry a lot in those dark hours, frustrated because the future we had planned is gone. I cry cause it seems so unfair. And then, the depression washes over me in great big waves, and more tears. I come on here because the anonymity allows me to open up. I get angry. I loose my temper. I find myself experiencing emotions I don't know how to deal with. My husbands dementia frustrates me, 6 months ago all was well, now he forgets, I find it hard, I know its not his fault, but, oh no, gere come the tears again. Thanks for the shoulders

I'm in the middle of a major depression which no amount or type of medication seems to be lifting. I met with my psychiatrist today, and he suggested I need to socialise more and stop isolating myself so much. I would agree with him but it feels as though everyone has turned their backs on me. I was hospitalised last year when the episode started and it feels since this became public knowledge I have lost pretty much any social contact I had. I took myself off Facebook and it honestly feels like I no longer exist. I'm at a loss as to what I need to do. I feel as though I've been dumped in the 'too hard' basket by both family and friends.

Hi everyone,
I don't often post on internet forums, always being more a post trawler. After reading through peoples stories about depression and anxiety on beyond blue and other support websites, I felt like it really validated some of the stuff I'd been feeling. It's actually very comforting to know, in a way, you're not that special. I finally felt I should add my own feelings. 
I was diagnosed with depression about 6 months ago. I have been seeing a psychologist for most of that time and have recently started on anti-depressants. I have supportive friends and family who know what I'm going through. So I have supportive networks. But onto something I've been experiencing and wanted to share.
 I feel I often can't think straight even in easy life situations. In the morning when I get ready for work I find it hard to follow a basic routine. For instance - making porridge. Involving grabbing a bowl, spoon, oats, milk and microwaving to make some porridge - easy right? But I often find myself hesitating in gathering all the different items. Like moments of complete blankness. It doesn't have any flow or ease. Everything is very slow. This feeling of fumbling through things extends to settings outside the kitchen.
Luckily for me, my work is very structured and routine (involving a lot of data entry, processes and computer work). Even still, I find myself making little absent minded mistakes and then upon reflection not knowing why I made that decision in the first place. It's like I'm not even completely there. And in workplace discussions I find my reasoning skills and even my ability to articulate myself properly is extremely hard. I find myself fumbling through the words. 
 And social situations are the hardest thing of all. It's rare for me to be able to engage people beyond the very routine conversations about the weekend or the weather. I find myself trying to think of things to say or ask. Sometimes on certain topics I can chat a bit about them but it's rarely a free flowing engaging two-way conversation. I frequently forget important pieces of information that people tell me like partners names, places they've been, interests they have. With Humour, innuendo & sarcasm I often find myself getting very confused by and often have to fake laughter at moments I think it's 'right' to laugh just to get along with people. 
 I'm wondering if anyone else can relate to this?

Hello all!its been a year since I took up some big changes to deal with avoiding that black chasm. The first six months of this year were great. I acknowledged a situation at work was not working for me and began a new job as an educator in a kinder program. I still found myself doubting my actions everyday and often ran through a checklist of questions, ""am I doing enough? Am I any good at my job? Would they tell me if I'm not doing things right or that I should be doing more?""  I'd remind myself that of course my colleagues would and I'm just being anxious and the thoughts wee just thoughts. This was a huge step forward for me as a year back these kind of thoughts weren't questions but statements that I choose to use to describe every single facet of my life past, present and future.  I guess I thought I was better. Beyond that point where I couldn't face it anymore. And I'd plan how I could easily just disappear and how I'd do it. These  scenarios became a constant daydream. They're back. I got moved, unwillingly, into another position where the educating team do not work well together. I'm supposed to help them unify. I don't think I'm emotionally strong enough to cope with it.  I don't want to talk to any of the very few friends I have about it . I don't want to be the 'Debbie downer'. But it's all started again. The questions have become statements again. I'm starting to think that everyone thinks I'm an idiot. I feel like a fraud. I should be able to control this.  How do you stay strong when it all starts to slide again?beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I feel like I'm on a Rollercoaster and just want to get off.
Some days I wake up and feel bright, optimistic and happy. Other days I wake up feeling neutral, which is fine by me. Then there are the days, like today, I am just so down, my heart is in my throat and I am panicked. Why? Why do I wake up feeling this way sometimes? 
How do I get off this rollercoaster? Is depression/anxiety something I will just have to live with for the rest of my life??

Tomorrow is one year since I decided to end my life. Obviously that didn't happen... I feel this weird mixture of really sad but also really thankful and... and something. I don't really know how to feel. I want to talk about it. I have hope now, I believe things are heading in a direction that is good. I feel thankful for that. I feel thankful for those friends who were with me when I wanted to end it. I feel embarrassed when I think of talking to my fiancee about it.. Like I could never explain it well enough. I feel like I'm not supposed to or allowed to talk about it with those close to me - what would I be trying to gain from talking to them about it anyway? Attention? I just want to not feel alone in it.. I want to say to someone 'Hey, this happened. I actually feel really sad about it today. This is what happened.. This is what happened next. Now I'm here.' and to feel heard and loved in that.Sorry.. uhh.. How have other people gotten through these kinds of days? Was it a time of reflection?

Hello my names Daniel. 
I will try to keep my story as short as possible.
I have been suffering depression/anxiety for around 10 years. When I was about 19 (5years ago) I finally went and got some help. I started on anti depressants and seeing a phycologist. When I turned 21 I don't know how but I had enough confidence in myself to leave my job as a plumber in Melbourne and leave all my friends behind and head interstate. I first worked at a couple of cattle stations in Queensland but only lasted a few months there.
I somehow ended up with a job at a remote resort in central Australia as a plumber. I ended up becoming the maintenance supervisor. I loved my job there and my life while I worked there. 
After two and a half years I left with my partner and headed to a job in kakadu. This was about a year ago and when things started to head downhill.
I started to feel sad all the time, frustrated, angry and anxious. I tried new medication but no luck.
In January this year I landed my dream job. Maintenance supervisor at a resort in the Kimberly. I lasted six weeks. I was so anxious for no reason what so ever.
I went back to Melbourne (currently still here). I'm doing plumbing again, and absolutely hate it, my friends that I had here are no longer my friends and I don't really feel like I want to be with my partner any more.
Im trying to save some money so that I can head back to the NT in the coming months but I don't know what to do for work as I hate plumbing.
I don't know why but my depression and anxiety feels so much worse now then it has ever been. I cry a lot, especially at work. I'm anxious about every little thing. I can't think strait and I don't know what to do. I have no friends here at all but I am seeing a phycologist again which I enjoy.
I just want to be normal and have a little bit of confidence.

I've known about my depression for years and have suffered on and off since I was 16ish. I am in a relationship and have friends but now I feel no one understands how I feel and they are against me and  I am pushing people away. Constantly in my head about what people are doing what they are saying and how that affects me. My girlfriend although I've spoken to her about this I fear deep down she doesn't understand and will eventually have enough and get rid. I can't seem to keep a job and the longer my unemployment runs the more anxiety I feel about being in an office environment and waking up for work every morning and being a fully functioning member of society. I'm seeing a therapist for the last few months twice a month but I don't feel it's making me feel better at all and I'm worried that it's a waste of time and that there has to be another solution out there to help me feel better. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I know the writing is scatty but I hope it makes sense.

i don't know why.... I have a good job (can be very stressful most of the time), a beautiful wife and 3 gorgeous kids. I can't wait to get home to them every day but when I do, I feel terrible. I get moody, upset and feel I snap all the time. It's like they don't understand me but yet I don't understand me. When I'm at work, I'm too busy to feel this way but seem to want to lock myself away when I get home to my beautiful family. I feel ungrateful that the main things or people who should make me happy, can't. Should I see someone about it it just toughen up and realise that I'm being silly and have no right to be unhappy considering who lucky I am to have such a great family and life.

Hi all, not even sure what is going on with me, so I thought I would put it out there and ask others for their thoughts :)  I feel flat, uninterested, sometimes a little sad, but not overwhelmingly so. Things just don't appeal to me, beautiful places are met with thoughts of ""meh"". I can laugh at a funny movie, feel sad at a misfortune of another, I just can't really be bothered with the things that used to bring me joy.  I would love to travel, but I  worry that I would spend all that money and be not amazed by the wonders around me. Also I have anxious thoughts about the most ridiculous small things and yet i don't stress about big stuff! I find it hard to be absolutely relaxed. I have had grief in my life, parents died when I was in my early twenties, husband died when I was 39, all of these happened over 10 years ago though.
i am able to put on a brave face at work, others would never know that I feel anything other than normal. I am probably known for being the kind, caring one, I have empathy for others. But I believe that my patience is wearing a bit thin (this could also be age / hormone related, turning 50 next year). 
Phew, that sounds like a whole lot of rambling doesn't it?????  Thanks for listening? Reading?

This is the first time i have thought about the possibility of being depressed but now it has finally hit me. Having a beautiful 10 minth old son and being somehow still engaged by fiancee and i are at crossroads. Things are just so bad that i dont know if they are fixable. She cant stand the sight of me yet alone us even having any intimacy. She is still suffering from Post natal depression and its very difficult on us both but she does her thing in some secrecy and i just ponder whether we will be like before. Its eating me up inside that its affecting my health. I have no motivation to go to the gym anymore or even eat on time. Everything has become a chore and is just an everyday repetitive cycle. I wake up early go to work. Come home and shower, have dinner and let her watch her tv shows. I absolutely adore soending as much time with my son and just miss the feeling of love. I dkbt know how to motivate myself and go to the gym again. I forgotten what it is to be happy again. I miss all of it. Someone please help me save myself from this destruction im in the path of i just cant handle it anymore feeling like this wondering am i good enough or am i worth it at all. It really really hurts feeling this way.

It's my first post on here; decided to sign up since I've just tumbled into the pits. I don't know what I expect to accomplish by posting here. Just venting, I guess.I'm a 30-year-old male who's sick of going nowhere and decided to return to study in an area that interested me and which might yield a more fulfilling day-to-day life (and possibly more than near-minimum wage). Just got my grades back - I've failed two of the four units in the first semester and I'm feeling angry... really angry about this. Recently, I felt that I was getting on top of my depression; I had finally found a drug that seemed to be doing the job, and I was feeling relatively positive about things. But now with this recent bad news, all the bad thoughts are forcing their way back in - the ones that tell you that you're worthless and stupid and will never amount to anything, so you might as well just kill yourself.On top of that, I'm living at home with my parents while all my friends are grown up, getting married, managing careers, buying houses, having kids, etc. etc. while I continue to be a perpetually single, underachieving, overgrown man-child. I'm not even working at the moment - not even part time. During this semester, I haven't come close to being able handle the workload and don't know how I could possibly fit employment into my schedule considering the amount of time it takes me to work through the assessment material; so instead, my savings from past employment continues to dwindle while I try to study. I feel even more worthless for this; I know many younger students can manage a balance between work and study and at my age and lack of other commitments, I should be able to as well.Anyway, I'll leave it at that for now, before I tell my life story.

i have been suffering these for at least 20 yrs and have been on medication since then they have helped but I am a worry wart and always thinking of the worst, I lost my mum/hubby within 6 mths and I suppose being on ur own doesn't help because u have to think. And u have no one to say hey it's ok. Just wondering if anyone else has the feelings which I get,head a little fuzzy and being on edge all the time.  Tittles

The past few weeks I've felt deep depression & anxiety come crashing down on me. My biggest problem is I have a lot that needs doing & I spend hours worrying & thinking about these things, telling myself I'll do it in the next hour & then keep procrastinating to the point I've achieved nothing. My circumstances are difficult-a partner with acute leukemia & 2 children who are acting out & not coping. I'm also involved in a civil case against the Church for abuse I suffered as a child. Yet despite those things I was very strong & coping with it all until 2 weeks ago. Yes I was running on adrenaline but at least I was on top of things in terms of being the main support for my family. Now I'm highly anxious & unable to get it together to do simple things. For example I've done all the washing the past few weeks yet there are 8 baskets in my room that need sorting & put away. It takes me at least an hour each morning to build up myself to even have a shower.im ashamed of this & spent most of my thoughts worrying about what I haven't been able to achieve. Does anyone have tips on how to deal with no motivation, too much worrying & no action?

Hi , new to this forum. I have been struggling with depression for close to 10 years and have a great wife and 2 teenage kids. Why i ask this, is it all in my head is I can go to bed feeling great and wake up feeling down. I usually don't sleep for more than 2-3 hours a night but am not tired in the morning. I have been to a psychologist for a couple of  6 week sessions and I walk away from my treatment feeling great. But it only seems to last for 3-6 mths and then I start having the ups and downs again with the up times getting shorter and the downs getting longer. I have been to my GP and asked if going on meds could help with this but they told me that meds are not for me. The psychologist also didn't want to prescibe meds and said that i should try different types of stress management techniques.With my ups and downs I don't feel it is fair to put my family through this all the time. I know everyone is different but is it all in my head or is this not so uncommon.

I'm wanting, needing to talk to someone about help/treatment of what I assume is depression or some other form of mental illness. It's hounded me for years but really reared its head with the birth of my first daughter 9yrs ago and has never really left.i mentioned suicidal thoughts with a maternal nurse when my second daughter was a newborn. I went through a very dark time. She walked me through a questionnaire and was worried about the results but she just handed me some pamphlets and sent me on my way. Never asking about it again.In the past two years I've had to slow down and now stop my once regular high intensity exercise due to some pretty major injuries and ever since I've had major ups and downs as the weight crept on and I lost my coping mechanism, exercise.i talked to a dr the other week but he was more concerned about my BMI (body mass index) than my mental health. Actually added increased BMI to my notes not the fact that I had also discussed how I was feeling mentally.these past experiences have left me with a major lack of trust with GPs and I'm struggling to make the first step to get help.im worried of wasting the practioners time and falling into a pile crying mess than I am in front of a professional. I'm worried of them judging me before they know my story. I'm worried about telling my story. I'm worried that I know  I'm better off than so many yet still have these issues. I'm worried about being labeled as a sook, attention seeker and waste of time.i know I can no longer drag my beloved husband through another breakdown. I know my children deserve so much better and I need to get strong for them. But taking that first step again seems nearly impossible. I did the questionnaire on the beyond blue website and it puts me at high risk. That's about as far as I've gotten.who is best to seek professional help without a GP referral? i have no idea about all the different titles. Mental health nurse sounds like a good option, approachable maybe?what was everyone's first step? Did everyone go through their GP? Those that didn't who did you see first? beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Where to start. I've known I have depression for all my adult life. It's now worse than ever. I also gamble to excess when very heavily stressed and depressed. Both go hand in hand. I don't drink. For some reason my vent is to say oh well, what does it matter and after the event feel even worse. Can't believe I blew the money the next day. Why do I vent this way? Wife of 23 years is now saying we should split. I love her and my kids with my last breath. I do everything for them. I need to get positive but it seems too high a mountain to climb. I'm feeling physical symptoms as well. Always cold and can't warm up. Multiple issues I know. Marriage in trouble. Causes Worse depression and in turn I turn to my vent which is gambling. I hate it. I do not gamble when not in bad depressed state. My depression is all consuming at times and I just want it gone for good. I want normal life and above all I want the love of my family. I need their support but my wife does not understand the illness. I'm a good person. Worked hard and provided. How can I ask for their support when I don't believe in myself to beat this affliction? I also don't like my job but I do it everyday and feel I am wasting away with no one to care. I would love a job helping people like me as I've been through it all. Feel good about myself and at the same time helping others will be perfect medicine. But here I am. Depressed and almost broke. Money can be replaced and I want my mood to be replaced too. Advice is appreciated. I've had so many things happen to me in my life and I see so many negatives in the world that get the depression into overdrive. I want to be helped and then to help.

A lot of people on here seem to echo the feelings I have a
lot of the time. Are there really answers or do most of us just need to put up
with it?

I’m married to a wonderful woman. My job is well paid but
insecure and unfulfilling, I spend most days on my own. My wife is away at the
moment and I haven’t spoken to a real person, face to face in 3 days.
I usually exercise to help with how I’m
feeling but I broke a rib recently so can’t do anything which is making things
harder.
I don’t taken medication, the only time I ever went to a Dr
they told me there was nothing wrong with me. However when I tick the boxes on
the test here it says I am scoring High. I
guess the very fact I’m even looking at this site should tell me something.

I just can’t see a way to climb out of this today.
Everything feels like it’s a crisis when I know in my heart it really isn’t.  Then I start to feel like an idiot for
thinking this way because I really have no actual problems at all.
I’ve tried to talk to my wife but she feels impotent because
what can she do? Then she starts to feel like it’s her fault (which it isn’t)
and then I feel ashamed that I’m dragging her down with me so I just smile and
say I’m fine.


Not sure what my point for writing all this is now, but here
it is nonetheless.

A confession from my life living with depression. 
I am enjoying this. I am enjoying me. I am happy. I am larger than life. I am sparkling. My wit is razor sharp. My hilarity knows no bounds. I am open. I am affectionate. I am full of love. I am so full of joy that my skin is stretched tight. Perhaps you have noticed? I am super ME. The biggest brightest version there is of ME. I am a blazing star. I am shining so I bright you can barely look at me. I draw you to me. I love this version of me. Life does not get any better than this. 
The crushing reality is... life does NOT get any better than this. I'm as good as I get. I am on a high. I am peaking. I am also a yo-yo. I swing from high to low. For me this joy is tainted with sadness as I know it is fleeting. So heartbreakingly fleeting. The only thing that follows this joyful feeling is a downward rush. I know I will free fall. There is no safety net. I have no parachute. The wind will slap at me and tear the joy from my heart and wrench tears from my eyes. I will burn out. My constant companion will make himself heard. He will not stay silent much longer. He waits patiently to pounce. He will try for his pound of flesh. He will want to fill the emptiness with darkness. He is already rubbing his hands together. We will battle. We are familiar. We fight the same fight over and over and over again, slashing and hacking and punching and clawing and screaming until one of us collapses in exhaustion and defeat. Neither knows who will win. I win more than I lose. I am hardened. I have perfected my moves. I dodge and duck and weave. I keep my guard up. I clutch my shield. I surprise him with my resilience. I am no longer predictable. I refuse to be any easy mark. I will not surrender without a fight. 
I don't let him see me tremble. I try to be brave. But he sees me. He knows me. He is me. We have been each other forever. He twists my dreams. He laughs loud and long. I hate him. Maybe. Maybe I hate him. 
So for today, I am enjoying this - my freedom and my joy. I am enjoying being so high I am dizzy and spinning and giddy.

Hello, I was diagnosed with mild depression a few months ago, if I am totally truthful I've had depression for a long time but wasn't honest with myself, my family or doctor. I've always been a strong person who puts everyone else first, troubled by childhood trauma and family issues I decided to take a career in social work, helping others to make positive changes then 2 years ago I went off sick for work related stress and anxiety, went through the battle if work cover with my employer and really messed around by various managers in my organisation that turned into bullying, this only made my recovery worse. I returned to work 12 months ago into a role I did 8 years ago and feel totally deskilled and devalued which had only made me feel more depressed. I have battled through, even took up running which has been my saviour but then the depression became worse a few months ago where I just didn't feel like getting out of bed, this happened for several days so I went to my doctor who prescribed me medication and said that I was experiencing mild depression as a result of the work situation and the way my employer had dealt with it. I feel totally hopeless and down on days like this when I can't get out of bed and go to work, even though I know I will feel better, it is easier to hide away at home. The medication is helping, the running is still there but it's my low mood that occurs without warning and simply knocks me off my feet.  Here I am lay on the couch watching daytime TV. I feel guilty as my partner worries about me, I want to be myself again, the person I was 18 months ago, however, I am starting to accept that I may not be that happy fun loving person again. Does anyone have advise or their stories to share with me about how to deal with this and your road to recovery. Are there any good groups in the Melbourne area that people meet face to face and share their experiences as depression can be isolating.

Hi all. I have been suffering anxiety and depression for a really long time. I am really trying to beat it though I always seem to find myself repeating the same patterns because anything outside of my standard routine is too hard to deal with. My life at the moment life consists of a 58 hour work week which doesn’t leave much time for anything through the week. On the weekends I catch up on house work, sleep and maybe see a movie and that’s about it.     I have recently started going to therapy again and she told me I should find a hobby and find groups of people to meet up with,though meeting in any kind of group is kind of like hell for me. On top of that I really don’t have anything that I am interested in at the moment. Most of the time I just feel pretty empty inside. I guess I have lost interest in most things over the years.I Know I need to socialize more if I want to improve, and there has to be more to life than work and bills though I am not sure where to start?Maybe I am past the point of no return?     Beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

i have had depression now for two years and a half years and i have coped with depression affecting my life all this time and jut this year it has been worse then usual. for the first four months of this year it has been really bad. my sleeping has been affected and i feel as if my body is wasting away.  some days are very good but there will be hours within those good day were the depression rears it ugly head and i cant see the end of the day coming. i feel as if i am drowning.  when i feel this way i do get out of the place where i live, but the next day i feel as if i am drowning again and it starts as soon as i open my eyes. has anyone got any ideas that might help me feel as if i am not drowning. i can go days without feeling this way but for the last few days it feels as if each day i am being forced underwater and i only get to breath every now and then. oh and has anyone told centrelink about their depression and was it recognized as a disability. i don't mean to sound as a slacker here but i cant go through the day without thinking about the possibility it might get easier if i told them that i had depression. oh well heres to a quiet night and a fast to sleep night for me. 
 see yas
let the hurtful comments begin (by the way i get very sarcastic when i am depressed) and yes i have been tested for bipolar and i dont have it.

Hi all,
Read an excellent post by Lizoria earlier this evening regarding how even those who help others with their mental health issues often struggle to talk about their own problems. The thread is here.
In her words, "" Saying this here, recording it in little bits and bytes on the face of the internet, makes me really realise how unhelpful keeping a 'brave face' is. But it is also very liberating to just let people in the world know that I'm not as tough as I like to think I am, and that it's ok""
I'm feeling pretty shoddy at the moment, its almost 4am here in Perth and I'm feeling a bit down, but thanks to the help I've received on this website I know it will pass. Once the feeling goes I can get back to helping as well.
So thankyou all who listen and contribute, you are doing a great job and should you ever need help we are here for you too, just as much as we are here for everyone else.
Ben

I hadn't posted in a month or so but I am not going well so here I am.  I am alive but most definitely not well. Since it has been a while, I'll try put everything that has happened in a short a description as possible. I am off crutches but still in a knee brace from the  post surgical fall i had a month ago.I have been suffering fatigue and other symptoms which i am not sure of the cause of but it has been going on for three weeks now. I have had an MRI and am waiting for the results.I am hoping they find something but i am terrified if what that something could be. I have a doctors appointment Sunday.My partner has a dislocated shoulder with little sign of recovery. They are investigating surgery. It is severely impacting her mental health and she has had to defer uni.I am 4 weeks behind in uni. I have been to five lectures, out of a possible 30. I have not studied at all at home due to all of the factors above, hospital visits to my girlfriend, driving to the ed with her at the wee hours of the morning. I need to do three units to get paid, but I am worried that i won't be able to catch up. Failing could be the trigger for another year long breakdown.My relationship with my partner is strong, but she has her own problems and we are working out how to care for each other and ourselves. We recently moved from a share house with far too many boys and a passive aggressive landlady to a homes west unit of our own. I am writing surrounded by furniture and boxes. This accommodation is more stable and long term, plus far more private which is what we both need.A close family friend passed on the 13th. Her death has affected my sister most greatly, but I miss her too. I was unable to attend the funeral because I was too sick to go. I will pay my respects another day. Her death was sudden and unexpected and everyone is sill a little shell shocked.Some mornings I wake up and instead of not being able to get out of bed because of physical illness, i can't motivate myself to move. I feel depression licking at my heels, slowly sucking me further under. Having been there before I can recognise it, but don't know how to fight it. i am in a bad head space. I know that. I have booked respite for a week, starting Sunday. i feel like I am abandoning my partner just after we moved in but i am stressing so much that I need the break. I need help.  GA

Dear depression,
You may have won the battle but you have not won the war. I forget what a sneaky A-hole you can be!!!I know you are stalking me and I take delight in knowing your confusion today when trying to find me. I am not where you presumed me to be. Were you surprised when you checked the bedroom? Expecting to find me curled up crying with the curtains drawn so you could climb in beside me and whisper you evil sweet nothings in my ear. No dear constant companion, I refuse to do that today. It may surprise you to learn that whilst you skulk around the corner I have been out walking with the dog (oh I sense how you loathe that puppy that chases you away). My garden is watered, the courtyard swept, the poop patrol done all without your constant dark neediness. I have taken and posted my photo for today, yes yes you abhor the pleasure I get from being creative.I can hear you, I can almost smell you, I feel you whining and grasping but I won't be playing with you today.Today you will lurk and I will give you no power.Until we play again, yours truly, Me

So I’m new to this.
I’m a little stuck and I don’t know what to do. I’m having
a lot of trouble trying to put it into words because I didn’t actually realise
that other people don’t experience this until a few years ago. I’m always some
level of sad, depressed, anxious, tense or wired or numb.

A few years ago I finally worked up the courage to go the
doctor and was set up with a mental health plan and to see a counsellor, but it
was a disaster and I haven’t managed to work up the same energy to try again. She
seemed to have already developed an opinion on what was wrong with me and I
felt she was trying to steer my thoughts in that direction. She seemed annoyed
that I didn’t consider myself to have suffered any trauma at any point to have
triggered this? I really don’t
think she was paying attention. Very frustrating. The thought of trying again is utterly exhausting.
I can’t make or maintain new friendships/relationships and I end up very
lonely, but other times I can’t bear the thought of being around anyone. I’ve
been using an unhealthy and not ideal coping method for a very long time.

I feel like it’s very obvious that something isn’t right – I’ve
never been in a relationship, I haven’t made new friends since I left school
(10 years ago) I never go anywhere, I don’t drive etc. I hate having my photo
taken and sometimes I just can’t hide my discomfort at simple things, like ordering
a drink. My family tease me about it sometimes, so they do notice.

I keep thinking that no one asks me what’s up because to them, it’s
unsurprising that a person like me can’t find anyone who wants to be around
them. It feels very much like there’s something awful about me that my family
are too polite to point out.

Sometimes I can’t bear to look at my face and I have to turn all the lights off
to shower so I don’t have to look at any part of me. I didn’t know it was a
thing that people could like or enjoy being themselves because I’ve never
experienced that. I don’t like people to hug or compliment me, because I always
feel it’s disingenuous. Sometimes the world feels full of ulterior motives and
other times it feels like there’s nothing there at all and I have no idea what
to do with that.
I don’t want to be like this for the rest of my life but I have no idea how to
fix it. I don’t know how to say all the things that are wrong because I’m not
convinced that it’s unrelated to how worthwhile a person I am. Would love some advice from this great forum.

My depression is contributing to the breakdown of my relationship with my partner. I try so hard to explain what I am going through to him but he never seems to understand and tells me I am fine and that there is nothing wrong with me. Why do I feel like there is more going on with me? There is a distinct line between managing on a daily basis with your emotions having highs and lows, and dealing with depression, separation, trauma, loss and grief? Or am I the only one? I feel like I am alone on the subject of depression within my family and friends.

So I've finally come to the realisation that the type of depression I suffer from is chronic and will be part of me for life.
 how do you accept that you will never enjoy life, never feel loved, never be fulfilled and still find the strength to get up every day?? How do I keep going when I'm beyond help

It`s ironic. many, many years ago I loved a young girl. She became the mother of my first born and immediately told me to leave. She was only sixteen and I 22. I married soon after another girl and remained married for 28 years having three children with her. We had a good relationship for many years although it was my first love I always pined for. My wife suffered depression as she knew where my heart was amongst other issues. My reply to her for years was get over it depressions is all BS. About 6 years ago I suffered serious depression and ended up in hospital for a couple of weeks over Christmas. I feel so guilty now for being so harsh about  her depression. Until I went through it I could not understand just how debilitating it is.
Three years ago almost to the day I met up with my first love again. Tears flowed, love reignited.  We both took the step and left our long term partners, and now live together in northern Qld. I love her dearly passionately and with my whole heart. We have lots of issues to deal with. We both grew up in entirely different situations and had entirely different marriages. My love has no understanding of depression and how to deal with me when I am depressed. My issue is I am so insecure it is ridiculous (when I am well) however so depressing when I am not well. My depression is killing my relationship something so precious to me. I appear to cycle with the highs and lows, first it was six weekly now it seems to be weekly and I cant remember the last weekend I enjoyed and had fun.... I don't want to lose this lady but if something doesn't change and soon I am almost destined to destroy what I have wanted for so long because I cannot control my depression.

My partner walked out in me seven months ago and I feel like I'm not coping. I have 3 children ages 2,7 and 12. My oldest two are from a previous marriage. My ex is living in another town so doesn't see his son much. I feel like everything is too much and I can't sleep at night. I used to love life but now I don't feel happy anymore. I know I should snap out of it and I try to stay strong for the kids but I find each day a struggle. I did go to see a doctor but he wouldn't give me antidepressants as he said it just seemed like it was situational.

I hide my depression from everyone and it's exhausting.  The irony is I work for a mental health organisation who are focussed on breaking down stigma and encouraging people to talk about mental health.
So why can't I talk to the people around me, who are likely to be more understanding than anyone?
Appearing strong, brave, confident and ready for anything seems to be such a core part of how I want to portray myself.  I remember reaching out to my mum a few years ago when things were very bad, just before I started taking medication for the first time.  When I told her how weak and hopeless I felt she responded, with utter surprise, 'but you're the strongest person I know!'
Unfortunately this desire to show people that I'm doing ok has been a real barrier to getting help.  I will make an appointment with my doctor with the intention of getting a referral to a counsellor.  But when we're sitting face to face in that little pastel blue room and he says 'so how are you?' I say 'I'm fine!' and start to tell him about how well I'm doing and how I'm trying to do all of this really positive stuff to help myself. I don't need anybody! I've got this sorted!
When I have gone to see a counsellor in the past, I've done much the same.  After the first few sessions of unburdening, I feel the need to show them that they are helping me and that I'm trying hard, so I just start to say 'yeah, things are good, I think this is working really well, I'm feeling so much better'.  The problem is, we've never really got to the heart of my problems.  I think I just want them to approve of me and my progress and then I disengage.
Saying this here, recording it in little bits and bytes on the face of the internet, makes me really realise how unhelpful keeping a 'brave face' is.   But it is also very liberating to just let people in the world know that I'm not as tough as I like to think I am, and that it's ok. 
So thanks for listening to me, even though I don't know you, it's nice to know that there are people out there who know I'm just as frail and sensitive as everyone else.

If you have never suffered from depression I don't expect you to understand it, you can't. That is not meant as a put down, it's just fact. It's like I cannot understand what it's like to be gay or black etc. What I can do, is accept that these things that I don't understand are a part of the world I live in and support those that struggle with  their issues. Depression can be frightening to those that have never had it. Having the blues and feeling down is something that we all go through and in no way can be compared to clinical depression. Depression is hard to describe, but one way it can be expressed is like a Black Dog. There can be times when that dog will attack, overwhelm, have you down on the ground ripping at your heart and your throat until you reach a point that you want to succumb. It is physical pain. Then, when you receive help, medication, support, you fight back, you tame the dog, teach it to sit quietly and calmly. Understand though, that the black dog never dies, it is always there, ready to spring at you again and attack if it is not kept under control. This is the fear that depression sufferers feel every single day, that it might attack again, and at various times it does. It is a skill you need to learn to recognise when the black dog is stirring, ready to attack. This may sound ridiculous and fanciful if you haven't been down there, but it is only my description of it. Be there when you can and listen, don't try to offer answers, just support. Also recognise please, that if a depression sufferer is upset, angry, sad, that these emotions are not necessarily caused by the depression, sometimes we have valid reasons for these feelings, as does everyone else. Don't look at us and think 'oh it's the depression' I suffer from depression, yes, but I am not defined by it. beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi,
This is my first use of a forum so here we go...
I am in the middle of trying to understand what is going on with me. For the last 6months in particular i have been feeling pretty low. Many would say that i 'tick the box' for depression. I have very low motivation, i have lost my enthusiasm for things i used to love, i have no sex drive, i have put on a significant amount of weight and i no longer feel like the fun, creative and spontaneous person i once was. At least once a week  i tell myself that i am going to change or try harder but i never do and these moments always pass.
I have a beautiful partner of three years. She is my best friend and there is no one i feel more comfortable with. We are very different in personalities, life experiences and backgrounds. She knows too well that i haven't been 'right' for a while and she is taking much of this 'blame' on herself. However, i think that i am projecting this guilt or blame on her. Superficially i think i blame and resent her. That my being in a relationship with someone that is so different from me has lead me to becoming a person that is now withdrawn and 'spiritually' lost. Where i would have once jumped off a cliff into a pool of water, she wouldn't even consider it. Right now, i'm bringing her down. I hate what i am doing to her and to myself.
I feel lazy, lost and and disconnected. Am i depressed or am i just going through a faze... I'm also not sure that if i knew the answer to this that i would feel any better.

I went and saw my GP and he had set me up under the Mental Health plan to have some therapy sessions. However I have neglected to go as I applied for this international program and you have to disclose if you have mental health issues. I have been wanting to do this internationally program for years and finally got through the first step (found out I got through a few days after seeing the GP) and it's literally the only thing that keeps me going these days.
But if I go back and get those therapy sessions, it will go in my medical record. I don't want to ruin my chances of getting into the program, but I know my mental health is declining and rapidy and I'm scared. Either way, I'm going to lose on one of them.

Hi there,
I am a 35 yo guy who moved to Australia 10 years ago.
I feel I wasn't and I am not a fit for this country. I appreciate all that Australia has given me, but there is more in life than money and a safe country.
I just feel life in Australia is very boring, monotonous, everything is the same, people are always busy and the conversations are always superficial.
I don't feel motivated to do anything, people are always watching TV and busy.
Do you feel this way?
I do appreciate your comments, I want to know about your experiences, I think there is a lot of depression in Australia.
Thank you

Hi everyone,this is my first post on here.
I've been struggling with depression on and off since 2002,and have recently realised i'm sinking back into that black hole again. I've worked so hard to beat it in the past,i feel annoyed at myself that im here yet again. I know this thinking actually makes the depression worse,but tell my brain that.
I think the fact that nothing major has really set it off this time is what's upsetting me so much...in the past it's been big things where i totally understood where the depression was coming from (murder of a family member,death of a parent with whom i had a difficult relationship,being stalked,and work issues because of my anxiety and depression over the other stuff),so just suddenly realising im there again with nothing to put me there has been kind of a rude shock for me.
Anyone have any advice for how to avoid falling in this hole over and over? I'd really like to beat it for good this time. Thanks.

Recently I learned that some of the experiences I have had been dissociative episodes. In a way it is a relief to know why I have done things.  At the same times it scares me.  I do a lot of writing and with help know a lot of my triggers and situations to stay away from.  There is thought, this feeling of not being able to trust myself. I know how to do the self talk and questioning the negative thoughts. To practice everyday will help make easier in the long run. 
Yet I still do not trust my own body and min. 
Has any one else experienced this and tips on learning to trust yourself?

Its been a while since I've felt like even though I'm supposedly surrounded by so many people that I'm actually really alone. I don't feel like anyone deserves to be burdened with my feelings or problems, and I honestly feel bad for having to imagine myself being a burden to anyone. When I think of who I can talk to I don't feel like I have the right to express how I feel because I feel it so often it feels unfair. Ive had a lot of ups and downs with my family and friends, mostly because a lot of them love to talk down about each other so much it's almost like a sport. I've tried to just keep quiet and go about my own life because I am so over having to hear about so many things being said about me, or hearing I said something to someone that is so fabricated it makes me wanna scream. It seems no matter how much I try and go about my own life people constantly just want to remind me that nothing can remain good. That you can't trust everyone, and that everyone is temporary. I can't stand to wake up anymore, and the thought if going home to my ""mother"" scares the living daylights out of me because I never know what to expect that I've done wrong this time.  I don't feel like I have much purpose anymore, or that anyone actually wants to spend as much time with me as I do with them and it eats away at my heart and makes me so so sad.  I just want to feel like I have a real purpose and that there are people out there who actually do care and don't have son e hidden agenda or are just going to leave me behind. Any words of positivity would be so incredibly appreciated right now. I don't know where else to turn to. :(beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all
 I'm new to BB and have been experiencing some significant lows in motivation over the last few months.  My question is simple, what can I do to get motivated again?
i have suffered from anxiety and depression for over ten years, am currently taking meds and have been for the last four years after many failed attempts.  Obviously winter doesn't help but I'm low on energy, would happily sleep all day and am really angry and Irritated.  I don't want to do anything.  Exercise is an enemy of mine, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, at the moment I'm a sloth.
I know my signals and this could lead to a big downward spiral.  
Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks.

I'm 30, a uni grad with reasonable experience, a love of what I did & a wealth of skills in other industries..
 What's the problem? Depression - from at least 15 years old. Pair that with being bullied from Primary School & an ever recurring alcohol habit from 18 years old. The drive to even *TRY* is lacking; I feel I have no fuel to fire that motivation I had 10 years ago to do a myriad of activities. This gloomy outlook impacts my relationship, my workmates, my friends.. yet I feel I am alone in this and they have no idea  even when I attempt to explain ""why I'm always a negative, grumpy so and so"". I have an encyclopaedia of regrets and feel these will always sit on my shoulders, weighing down my prospects of rehabilitation.. 
I should be happy - long term relationship, steady (albeit boring & unrewarding job unrelated to my studies) work, supportive social/familial circle.. but the persistent gloom returns. I've lost interest in my creative & physical pursuits; instead imbibing, sometimes excessively 6/7 nights a week and feeling that I have failed in virtually everything I have tried. 
 
I feel I need a kick up the backside but am honestly worried of simply falling into the same old pit time & time again.. Thinking it's time to visit my Doc again & see what he reckons.. 
Sounds like a rant, reads like the start of a story.. Cheers

I think my head is clearer, but I am quite forgetful, regularly tired, and do things that I shouldn't, like visit dating sites and talking to other women around the world.i have just about used all the free counselling thru Medicare I can get, I have no income but do not qualify for any assistance til end of August. i hope by sharing here, I can come to be more comfortable with my situation.any help or suggestions appreciated.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I'm coming out of a major depressive episode, due to a series of stressful events beyond my control with work,family,life in general.Been trying so hard to avoid negativity of others at work and either ignore/ let snide comments slide not to be over-sensitive.
But today at work,it was a wierd day anyway.Then I was sent to cover someone for what I was told would be an hour.  Teacher A,whose class I was working in was annoyed ( though not with me),as she wanted me to do small group work. I told her I'd be back in an hour .
Firstly, I got sent to the wrong room, felt like an idiot becuase the class was empty. Rang back to check for the right room number (being a typical depressive?GAD asumed I'd got it wrong)only to find out that it was the person who'd sent me there had got it wrong. 
Feeling very wrong-footed already, went into a class I'd never been to before, to  have that teacher really snap at me in a very terse patronising tone, about something very minor, in front of a parent and  students. Even when I explained why I'd made the error, she continued to make a big deal out of it.
Then the staff member I was relieving didn't come back for 1 3/4 hours, so I felt guilty about that. It was outside my control, but I felt bad, went to apologise to the teacher whose class I'd left, but couldn't find her. 
By now, it was the end of the day.I went back the office I share with a workmate, who I usually download to. But she was in an intense conversation with someone, that they quite obviously didn't want me to hear. 
So grabbed my stuff, went home and am left feeling really down and with that choked throat , want to cry , but can't feeling.My Queensland father in law had a great saying, (  no offence intended to anyone, it's about the sentiment expressed not the subject) that perfectly fits my mood ""Some days, you could far kick a nun down the stairs""
Why is it some verbal arrows pierce your 'mental armour' ,hurt so much, shatter your self esteem and carefully reconstructed confidence??
If this was anyone else I'd be saying ,""Don't worry about it , it's her problem not yours"". Why, can't I believe that myself,
Does the self-loathing,feeling of inadequacy,over-sensitivity ever get better? Is it always going to be one step forward, two back? I'm just so over the endlessness of ' emotional triggers' at the moment.
Am dreading going  to work tomorrow, possibly running into that particular teacheragain, plus having to explain to the teacher whose class I'd left.

Do you think people from the 17th century, 18th century, during the world wars, were more prone to depression than people today? Did they have a greater desire to survive? Surely their social pressures and environment made it more difficult for them. I'm asking because I feel like I am so lucky in my life but I can't appreciate it.

Hey everyone
I am reluctant to go into details of my situation but am hoping to hear feedback from people who have beaten depression on how they went about it? What sort of advice did counsellors give? I'm sure if psychologists all do the same study there must be some standard list or process they collectively advise to clients? 
 
Hope to hear from someone
thanks, Josh

Hi All, I am a 46 yr old male. I am married and have 2 children. 14 yr old boy and 16yr old Girl. I think I have been suffering fro Depression and Anxiety of over 15 yrs, probably more. I am on Anti depressants from my GP and have had some counselling. Not sure what I am feeling anymore, just Numb. I worry about everything. Finances, work, family, everything. I have no energy anymore to do anything as I work 6 days a week and still am getting no where. I was involved in an armed robbery a few yrs ago at a servo I worked at, and I think since then I have got worse. I have lost all my confidence in everything I do, mainly work. Being made redundant twice has not helped my confidence. I am working now with a great bunch of people and have done for 7 months now, but the money is not great, hence why I have to work 2 jobs, to keep my family afloat. I am now getting to the stage where I do not care about anything and any one, and all I do is worry and get paranoid about things. Already seen two councillors that MY GP referred me to. The first one I did not like, and the second I could not make the appointments due to my work commitments. My GP will probably not refer me to anyone else because of it. I have no respect from my Kids, and not sure how the wife feels about me.  Not sure where to turn. Any advise guys.

Today is day 3 of no sleep, I called in sick at work for the third time this week. I spent 5 hours listening to bob dylan songs writing parts from his lyrics over & over, the parts that made me feel like someone understood. Today I feel a manic side of depression. I kept thinking of quitting my job. Of moving towns. Of change. But it doesn't matter really. The black dog chases you down no matter where you are. Does anyone feel like depression makes you watch your life waste away. You stay indoors. Stay quiet. Hope for a nice moment?

Hi all
I woke up on the wrong side of the bed today. As I was getting ready for work, a feeling of sadness came over me which unfortunately didn't go away all day. I spent most of the day being unproductive and generally keeping to myself. I don't know why I have these (what seem like random) bad days. Then when I have them, I panic about them lasting longer than a day and me falling back into depression.
Any advice/words would be greatly appreciated.

Since my early teens I have felt different, left out, ostracised, rejected, square peg in a round hole. People always used to ask why I never smiled, why did it look like I had the weight of the world on my shoulders.
I was incredibly introverted and lacked confidence although being very good at sport was a saving grace. Being mildly competitive, I loved the skill aspects of AFL and cricket but never got into the team bonding and mateship that much; it never interested or motivated me. As a shy teenager, I struggled meeting girls. Between that and some pretty hard rejections, I had an incredibly lonely decade and turned to alcohol.
For the last 36 years or so, I've felt hollow. My wife and I joke about me being all dead inside. I tell her that I'm a broken human being. It's crazy how you can feel gloomy for so long and think that's normal. It's like living with a glaucoma that hazes everything you see, think and feel and disappears anything that used to be enjoyable. I feels like I have to make myself do everything; I have no motivation that other seems to have in keeping a house tidy, playing with the kids, gardening or fixing things, travel etc
I'm married with 2 boys. For most of my marriage, I've been going through the motions. I generally don't feel anything for my wife so I have to make it up and think what I should be feeling in different situations. She can see through my charade and is incredibly hurt by it.
About the only thing I get enjoyment from is my writing. I started writing long fiction a few years ago. My wife has a great job and works full-time while I look after the boys and the house, so I have plenty of time to write.
I have tried to leave my marriage twice (we have 2 boys). I met someone else (a writer) who summoned feelings from me that I never thought I would feel again: flushes of warmth and joy right through my chest. I tried to leave but came back both times; I couldn't deal with the guilt and loss. I guess I'd rather live with a life of regret rather than a life of remorse. I can't stop thinking about what it would be like to spend a life together with my *special friend* and all the positive feelings that it seems to promise. I do wonder whether it would fade back to gray after a while though, like everything else has over the last 46 years. I'm resigned to a life without happiness or joy but it will be liveable.

Hi I'm new to this forum
 
i am currently a 33 year old male that's been single for 8 years, all my friends are getting married to beautiful women and I seem to can't even get a second date let alone a beautiful one.
 my depression just gets worse and worse, to top it off my best mate just separated from his wife and has now been seeing a very beautiful girl.
 
i just don't know why I don't have the same luck as my friends in this life. I seem to always struggle in everything compared to all my friends.
 
8 years has been such a long time, the jealousy towards my mates and the hurt I have is making my life unbearable.
 
i just don't know what to do anymore

Wasn't planning on typing further posts here but there's nobody else. I am in a hole and it sucks. Sunday was a good day for me. First good day in so long I can't remember. I was actually having a laugh with a friend I hadn't seen in months and I felt good. Monday arrived and I was anxious and teary. Tuesday similar though not as bad. Today I feel both good and bad and I can't explain that, I really can't. Does anyone know what I mean?
Am off work until next week so it's not agoraphobia or work stress, just depression I guess with anxiety for no reason. I am bipolar. Work haven't really kept in touch, which is kind've a relief really. I did call in of course. One message from an manager asking me to call again was returned by me 4 times but couldn't get through. After a couple of hours of trying I instead left HR a voice message and an email, which was acknowledged so I assume no news is good news. I will call again tomorrow though to be responsible. I can't afford to be unemployed.
 I'm well aware this job is not a good fit. It is an area I've had a great deal of past experience but I guess it has evolved and changed a lot over 20+ years. I am applying for other more suitable roles as well as entry roles in a different industry. I'm mainly seeking part time to be sensible as I'm not quite right. If that all works out (really soon), then I feel like I can save myself. 
I have cancelled my psychology appointment on Friday as I haven't the funds to go.  I'm not paid when not at work. On a good note, I think the new medication is settling. It still sedates me but seems less than before. I can think better and not drift and nod off. Hopefully my weird up and down emotional mood is about the settling in of medication. Being back at work will be the big tell... Well the horrible CBD peak hour commute probably will be too.  Ahh, I just feel so out of control and lost. 
I've discovered a new mental health group, Mind that is somewhat more local to me than the 2.5 hour commute and there is potential of no cost psychology of some description. Unlike the Government standard issue, they were actually lovely on the phone and seemed keen to help. I just need to take the right steps to get the ball rolling. This could be very good. I was floored that they sounded approachable and I got through in 2 minutes. It's stuff like this that lends hope.

Hi there,            I guess on some level I've always known that ive had depression. But have never admitted it to myself because I've always felt that admitting it would mean that I'd let it consume everything. But I think perhaps it's slowly crept up on me anyway. I fill out my day very well. I excersise, i run, work, socialise way to much in order to keep myself from coming home and letting myself realise my reality. Essentially im pretty happy in doing these things. But at the end of everyday I realise my harsh reality of not being who I thought I was going to be. Everything I work for falls apart and that I have no confidence, such low self esteem and negativity about myself that I spend hours every night condemplating my life. I refuse to sleep because I feel like I'm wasting precious time when i should be working on how to get my life together. I fidgit constantly and can never shake the feeling of being lost. Lost with work because it's a dead end job and i hate it. confused about my sexuality that i have accidentally formed a double life on. The straight me vs the gay me. I tell myself i identify as being a lesbian but I think that perhaps I just got over being told that i was my entire life that perhaps i just went along with it. Growing up I wasn't allowed to be sad or cry or show much emotion at all. I thought once I moved out and went to uni it would all sort itself out. It never did tho. I guess I feel trapped in a life full of making everyone else happy and caring for everyone else that I forgot that i maybe needed the help. I have no support because im everyone else's rock and because I don't know how to ask for help. My world appears very normal but im honestly struggling with myself and can't overcome helplessness :/ beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi,
I'm new to this forum.  I thought I would share my feelings and day-to-day struggles with others.
I'm a mom of 3 children and am happily married.  I have a good life and nothing to complain about. All my life I havd battled depression. I've gotten really good at hiding it as I'm worried that people will not like me or think I'm to much work. 
And if I'm honest I don't think I have anything special to offer the world. I don't excel at anything and I've never had a talent. But to the outside world I project something different and confidence.
My self-worth is so low and I worry people will not like me. Today my fear came true. A friend had picked up my depression and knocked me down for it. I felt my mental health was bullied.
I am just wondering if anyone else lives in secret with their depression? And what about your self-worth? I am hoping by listening to others will help me relate and help me change the way I feel about myself.
Thanks for listening.

Putting it short,
I'm a Mum of 4, I have a little boy in my care all the time and 3 girls that are with there dad, Most people would read that and think why hasn't the mum got her girls, Well ive been in battle with my ex for 6 years, it has gone back to court again, I gave up as he is a liar and controls everything.
 
 
 
 Every single day I wake up and my chest achs, I need someone to talk to but everyone seems to busy or simply don't understand, Ive tried to salvage what is left with my sons dad but he just can't understand why I'm like this, why am I so upset, we don't have a friendship and we don't get along, I feel like every day all I see is the negatives, growing up has not been easy, and it seems like its not getting any better. Ive come here in hope to meet people I can talk too or vent with, I have major depression and it is the one thing I would change if I could. I want life to be happy, and enjoy my days, instead I seem caught up in the dark circle with no one to share my thoughts with without being told I'm just a negative person, and never happy.

I was diagnosed many years ago and have been medicated for severe clinical depression and anxiety attacks.  Have been going ok for quite a while now even through losing my husband and raising six kids on my own.  It will be four years in September.  I moved interstate 10 months ago and all was good but just lately I have been feeling really down and not sleeping, but most importantly I find myself separating from my children.  I love them so much but can't seem to handle their needing me.  Don't get me wrong I plaster a smile on my face and do what needs to be done, but I'm feeling empty and false.  I know this will pass but right now I just need someone to know how I'm feeling.  I'm feeling desperately alone and lost.

Hi everyone,
I've had anxiety trouble my whole life and I've had depression before and come through it but now it's back too. This year I was really sick for months and it screwed up my hormones. It was right on the start of the uni semester which I was enrolled in two weeks behind everyone else due to an admin delay. I've been behind in that the whole way and I missed too much time at work and struggled to come back. I'm trying so hard to get my health back and my life on track but it feels like I'm getting nowhere. The depression is starting to erode my motivation so I can't see the point in even getting up in the morning. 
Before I fell down I felt so strong; I'd done so much to build myself up and work through my anxiety. Now I feel like a shadow of my former self and I can't think well enough to get myself out of my hole. My health is so poor but I'm anxious about food and it makes me panic so it's a huge effort to fix. I really suffer in the cold of winter as well because I have such terrible circulation. I'm so short on hours at work and in study that I don't have time to see someone for help. I know I have a lot of good things in my life and a lot to look forward to but I just can't seem to find the step I need to make my breakthrough this time. Each little thing that goes 'wrong' feels like a mountain I can't get past and though I'm still doing some good things I'm really down on myself over the bad things and getting really upset about my uni exam performance. 
If life would give me a chance to catch up that'd be great but it doesn't wait. So I keep doing what I can and try to stay open to the next day. Writing helps so I really appreciate being able to talk on here.

I'm really at a loss of what to do. I'm sick of feeling depressed. I feel so undervalued, unappreciated, unmotivated and unloved. I have family who are very busy and who try to help as much as they can, but I feel as though I'm a nuisance to them. Nothing in my life seems to be going the way it should. I'm a single mum who works full time. I feel burnt out and need a change of scenery. I can't move due to my son's father. I'm a mess. How can I make myself feel confident again?

I'm an international student studying in South Australia. I have repeated and with from one uni. And now, I'm gonna fail this one soon. I'm in an IT course and not very good in programming. Have seek but advice given was limited. I think my depression is relapsing. Made no real friends here since my arrival almost 1 and half years back. I got so frustrated with my course work that I stopped going to campus since last week. 
The only person that is keeping me sane is my elderly mother whom I called weekly on the phone. I have a history of unable to form relations at any level. Am seriously at a loss and broke down earlier. My issues are much more deep rooted that I do not know how to clean it. I need help, thanks for reading. Adios.

I know its probably been done before but just interested with the advent of movies like The Matrix series and now with the amazing technology in Virtual Reality.
 Does anyone else feel like they are walking around in some artificially generated scenario and just wish that they could find a way out?  Escape the pain and suffering for the real life we are meant to have, pain and symptom free.

Hi all, I have never done this before... I am more a face to face person but right now this suits. I am a counsellor and I think I am struggling with depression & anxiety. I am 27, female and loosing interest in all I have... this appears to be seasonal and usually beings around april and hits home hard at winter. I almost ended my almost 9 year relationship last night...I want to quit my job, move overseas and start a new life - all my attachments done feel good enough - nothing feels good enough. How do i go from Nov last year feeling so in love, happy, content, calm - to now craving feelings in any way i can get them? I am a very emotional personal, I like feeling things - but now I feel numb, and its hard to stand. Its so hard because logically, as someone who spend 6 years studying to be a counsellor i know what's happening - but it doesn't mean i can stop it, or feel less alone in this place. I have cried on and off for small reasons, i feel ive been sick or run down most of the year, i want a completely different life and find my ususal interest boring and stupid, i feel nothing. Everything is a chore. Im bearly sleeping then struggling in the morning, my diet is horrible, i have no drive for anything. When i told my fiancé this - he was so upset, i could see he was crushed - i told him a want a different life, away and i need change - i felt nothing while he was sad...i feel i cried because i knew i should feel sad...but i felt numb, and dying to run. What the hell is wrong with me? Do others feel this sense of numberness and need for change when they have depression? I am so scared i am going to throw away everything ive worked hard for, everything i love, just to feel a rush...it scares me... I know i want to be alive, im not suicidal. I am just flat, numb and lost... Please let me know if anyone has shared similar experiences?

I'm normally a highly motivated person. Just last week I was buzzing around, getting things done, excited about life.  Now the fog has come back and turned off the motivation switch! It took me an hour to will myself out of bed. It took me another two hours to get dressed. I tried making a list, but it's just overwhelming - I can't prioritise so I end up doing nothing. Hopefully by the end of the weekend I can motivate myself to have a shower! How do you manage this problem?

Hi there,
This is my first post here.  This week's been tough, I have woken up and cried every morning.  I have come to terms with the fact that I have mild depression and anxiety and it's been very confronting to admit that.
I don't have a story as such, I come from a good family/friends/fiancé - however feel anxious and depressed.  For many years, I told myself I don't have any 'thing' to be sad about and brushed the feelings aside again and again.  I told myself to move on / focus on the positives and other clichés.  But late last week I couldn't do this any longer. With the help of a close friend who said 'mate you've got the black dog and you need some help'... I went to see my GP, got a mental health plan and got some time with a Psychologist. 
I'm embarrassed that I feel this way 'for no good reason'
I'm also a bit scared of needing medication to help me get better.  I can't keep crying everyday.
I'm also worried about recovering/adjusting to medication while continuing working.
Thank you for reading.

Hi,
I am new here. I'm 32 and have suffered from depression and GAD since I was a late teen. I pride myself on being strong and try my best to never let others see just how despairing I am. I guess it's a survival mechanism. The thing is, I'm having to work extra hard at acting at the moment and I feel like I'm having a breakdown. 
Everything just seems to be going wrong and usually when life knocks me down, I get up fighting but right now, I don't feel as if I can get back up. 
I can feel myself pushing away the people I love because it's just too hard for me to explain what's happening inside my head. 
Yes, I am seeing a psychiatrist. Yes, in the past I've tried CBT. Yes, those closest to me do know that I suffer a mental illness. But, I don't feel like anything is helping me right now. 
My fiancé lost his job 4 months ago. I've been weaning off a prescribed medication since March that has been a demon on my shoulder for 8 years, which means I haven't been able to work. (Another story all together). We've had to move back in with my parents. My Mum is an alcoholic. No, we don't have any other reasonable options for accommodation whilst out of work. We're running out of money. We spent years saving for a house deposit and it's all dwindling away. Supposed to be getting married next year - already postponed once because of money or lack of. No, I don't want to give up my dream of a wedding day and just get married at a registrar's office. I've had numerous health scares which fortunately turned out ok. Both mine and my fiance's cars were stolen (Another long story). Both found stripped and burnt. Mine was insured, his was not. 
I am currently a full time carer for my mum and my dog - they've both had new knees put in. But I don't receive centrelink (for Mum) because of a multitude of reasons - too long of a story to explain. 
I have so much pressure and stress going on inside my head. I'm exhausted. I'm despairing. I feel alone in a room full of people. 
I once heard this quote about depression - ""A human being can survive almost anything, as long as she sees the end in sight. But depression is so insidious and it compounds daily, that it's impossible to see the end. The fog is like a cage without a key.""
There's so much more to my story, but not enough words, energy or time to explain..How can I pull myself up out of this rut? I know I need to pick myself up again, but don't know how? I've tried positive affirmations. Any advice? Thank you.

want to feel good, I
DON’T KNOW HOW?
my brain keeps falling back into
negative thoughts, I have had depression for as long as I can remember, I think
it started in primary school and has continued throughout my life.
My depression like many others started from bullying. 
Many of the people
that hurt me are completely oblivious to the fact that they are causing pain. I
went through my Facebook and deleted anyone who
makes me feel like a lesser version of myself. I like to call these people fair
weather friends, they are the ones that are there for you when everything is
fine and dandi, but as soon as something better comes along they drop you like
a hot potato.
If you’re not the coolest or hottest person in the room
no one wants to know you. The number of times “friends” have asked me to come
out and then said hi and completely ignored me for the rest of the evening is
countless, and to be honest terribly disheartening.
I'm kind hearted and find it easy to open my heart to new people. 
This is
often my downfall, people take advantage of this and it makes me feel terrible.
Throughout my schooling I was the target of school bullies and heartless jokes,
(I know everyone says they were bullied but this was the start of my
self-loathing), 
My weight and looks have always been a negatively addressed, fuelled by other peoples nasty comments.
I feel that holding onto all the negativity is stopping me from becoming the
best version of myself, these people
were cruel to make themselves feel better and even though I know this it still
hurts me. 
Some days I look in the mirror and I feel like a waste of space I let
all this negativity get on top of me and it feels like I am drowning.
These negative thoughts that creep into my head whilst I am trying to get to
sleep at night have kept me up for nights on end, when they were happening
there was tears and anger and feelings of helplessness. 
I’m not a
confrontational person and I don’t think fast on my feet so most of the time I
am left with regret of things I should have said or done, which I’m sure would
have made things better at the time but them again the few times I have stuck
up for myself I am left feeling negative because I have lowered myself to this
level.

My last hope was that maybe a strong women or man whose had to overcome many
things might have an opinion on this topic and maybe just maybe could contact
me, in the hope that my quest for inner happiness and release is not all in
vain.

hi,
 so many things floating around in my head and Im not sure where to start or even what to say. I was 'diagnosed' with PTSD 5yrs ago. I say 'diagnosed' because even though I am sure thats what it is I could no longer afford to see the psychologist for a variety of reasons so didn't really investigate it.
 I am married, albeit unhappily, and have 3 wonderful children, d-22,s-17,d-15, whom I live each day for. I know deep inside that I need to try and access something, anything that can help me ride these crises, but I continue to ride each day out until it passes. The smallest of things, today it was rejection, rejection confirming that I am not an attractive person, that I am fat and not worthy of anything, that I am stupid and a drama queen. i suppose they are right, I am
my entire story would take up the allotted 2500 words and its messy and probably not the right place for it. I am also not proud of some of the paths i have taken so by not acknowledging them seems to make them go away, if only for the briefest of times.
 Today, I've been on the brink of tears for most of the day but tell myself to shrug to off and get on with things. sitting here typing this I am holding back the tears, the kids are home and this is not their problem they don't need it, can't show any weakness. The husband is here, can't let him see I'm struggling cos he doesn't understand nor does he show he cares, this is all his fault. well maybe not all, but i feel a majority of it is
so what do I do, where do I turn. I have no friends, he made sure of that. I can't be seen to 'waste' money on a psychologist because its a waste and doesn't work anyway, according to him. so i spend most days sitting on the iPad playing an online game and interacting  with my 'friends' who don't judge or care but are there and treat me with respect.
even getting to the supermarket is a challenge, mainly because i can't be bothered. I've gained weight and don't even care, well i sort of do, but its easier not to
 HELP..I'm lost and don't know where to turn

I am self diagnosed aspergers or somewhere on autism spectrum I am not as high functioning as aspies but I also have diagnosed major depression and severe anxiety that complicates it and have had it for about 28 years the depression and anxiety and the bad panic attacks started as a teenager. Noone picked up the autism in childhood they knew something was wrong but didnt really know what because I could read write and talk and had high IQ they never thought of it I guess. They tested me for epilepsy because I would trance out in class and not be responsive or communicate properly they thought it was seizures.As I am now 33 I have had a lifelong battle with poverty, housing and accessing medical and dental assistance. I cannot drive and I  live in rural NSW on a 2 acre small hobby farm with my mother. My life has been here for 8 years and I have a great love of animals they have been my only friends and only family that gives a stuff about me at all is my mother but she is also not well mental health problems also possibly mildly autistic but not diagnosed and she has a range of health problems. We have 2 acres but our house is very small and mum hoards stuff theres not much room not really any kitchen our taps dont all work and our front door is jammed so bad I broke or damaged my wrist before easter I am only guessing it is broken because it initially hurt and I can see the bone sticking up under my skin in my wrist with a big gap where the joint was. I have reduced mobility in my hand and wrist and I never got to a doctor. Theres no transport my mum drives but getting her to take me anywhere can take a long time and she dosnt always want to leave the house. I also had a filling fall out of my front tooth and havnt been able to see a dentist its got to where I dont really care about it and manage to ignore a lot of the pain. I am not very verbal anymore over the years I have become less verbally able to communicate and I canot talk on the phone very well and this makes my anxiety a lot worse and I end up having a panic attack if the phone even rings. I it was up to me I would have it unplugged. I dont use mobile phones at all and just using the computer is hard so this is taking a lot of effort to come on here.

I've been recently starting to see someone again who I have been friends with for years and who has seen me before everything went down hill. Now that I have a mental health problem, he just doesn't understand anything I say when it comes to how I'm feeling or if my thoughts get the better of me or just down to depression. How can I explain to him how I'm feeling in a way that someone with no experience being around someone with mental health issues. Its becoming really heard for me because all I want to do is talk to him without a mini argument of it and at the moment I'm feeling like I'm walking on eggshells just to pretend I'm happy not just around him but around others as well.
How can I explain to him in a way he may start to understand not fully but just a little so I don't get triggered?

So, I have been very recently diagnosed with depression,  though I haven't been myself for quite some time. My wife has noticed a change in me, but she had never approached me to talk. I am usually fairly quiet, and not a big talker when it comes to my feeings anyway. We have been through a hellish two years of family court proceedings regarding her two children, which has put a lot of strain on our marriage. I have always tried to be the rock she needs. But now that I have a name to call this horrible, lonely condition, she has retreated and is treating me like I have a contagious disease. During my worst depressive episodes, she runs. It's like she is in denial. She has admitted that it's hard for her to stop and help me,  when the four children take up so much of her time. She is clearly not coping, but I find it difficult to be so concerned about her when I can't see through my own gloom. I am so alone in my marriage. 
Can anyone relate?

Hi people. I'm having a rough time and thought I should attempt to seek help while I'm not in denial. I've spent my life looking after people with mental health issues, personally, I was even studying to make it my career. My partner had several suicide attempts before an amazing two years where he rebuilt and became the strongest person i know. Unfortunately I find myself lost because I don't need to take care of him anymore (not a conscious activity on my behalf) I have slowly lost my way over the last 18 months I guess, although I'm not sure I was ever particularly stable, never in a happy place, more numb. I know what I should do in my situation, from life experience with my partner and my psychologist training I started, I need help because everyone has bad times etc. however my brain and the rest of me seem to be ignoring each other. I rate 34 on a k10, consider self harm or passing thoughts about not being around (nothing acted on). I plaster a fake facade to get through work but the energy it takes is extraordinary, and when my obligations are met I fall in a heap and am unable to even cook tea most of the time. My house is a disgusting mess, I don't pay enough attention to my wonderful son, and although my partner and I have always been best friends, I wonder when he will finally leave me because I don't fully satisfy marital issues (although he says of course I do and he'd never leave). I stopped studying because it was easier to work (minimum wage type) and because I feel too exhausted to deal with other people's problems but my exhaustion is no better. I can't take time off because I work for family who can't manage without me. Little voice in my head says I did that deliberately albeit unconsciously. My self worth has never been great but is equal to the kitty litter tray right now, and the only time I feel better is lying in bed with my cat for company because he doesn't need me to act a certain way. My partner tries to be supportive but I feel disconnected from him because he has his life together. I don't want to take medication because I feel that makes others see that I'm an unfit parent and I worry about my son being taken away from me. I don't know how to see a counsellor because I'm not sure I'm strong enough to take any more home truths about how screwed up i am. Rationally I know things need to change and I need to change them but realistically I'm so tired. And feel so useless and lost. And sad. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hey peeps
first time post.
i got anxiety from being different im quiet and don't like attention even positive.i was outgoing over driven with things that I would do eg.if I had some sort of vision I would make it happen full stop.in my mind I can do anything.im a builder/carpenter and also have built race cars.skate surf weekly.have been sponcerd in the past.
I was hit by a lot of judgment to the point where I would get anxious.people(workers) would watch me work because of the pace and the enthusiasm I had.i watched them try to as they say get in people's heads(mindgames)I seen groups of people target people on these work sites.after putting up with this for years it slowly broke my confidence and I would get anxious at work.to the point where anxiety had set in solid.i left that job any was hit with the same thing at another job(new)I went in with a unsettled mind tense serious.i quit that job as the bullying got very bad.
anxiety made me slowly stop doing what I like.because being judged had been woven into my thought pattern.then came depression i have been fighting this by myself for 8 months it's been the hardest thing I've ever done.my partner is not very supportive.i tryed explaining but there was no getting threw.i also lost my licence so I was home bound all summer 6 months was very hard.ive never taken meds and never stopped fighting it.never stopped working and try my hardest to stay active.its been very hard but I'm getting threw it.i told childhood friends and they also didn't understand telling surrounding friends(saying I'm loosing it)I also tried to tell a friend I work with and it was spread threw my new job.witch made me feel betrayed.and even worse.coming to the end of this I'm starting not to care but I don't want to be to Mutch of a a$$hole finding the happy medium.keep fighting it I've found my character is taking a change but the old character was a victim.that was by far hell I'm still not full recoved.but never give up and adapt.i feel for people that have to go threw this.
get well people.love you all

I've always been lonely but lately I've been getting more and more angry, I feel abandoned by everyone, like a total outcast. I can't make friends and i can barely take care of myself it feels like such an effort just to shower everyday. I know what I have to do but it's so hard just to do it, all I do is sit around daydreaming and listening to music. Can't even be bothered to make a doctors appointment even though I need to and I'm still crying almost everyday. I often feel like hitting people or throwing things I used to be so peaceful too.

I am on this merry-go-round of up and down days, as I am sure a lot can relate with.
Today, is one of the low ones. Start with about 4 hours of very broken sleep caused by all living souls in this house including the four legged furball. Next up, my youngest had an appointment with CAMHS which actually went well, but also re - highlighted that the are definite signs of Aspergers - not a shock but still not the best news either.
I still have a lot of paranoia/anxiety in regards to my fiancée. There are starting to be signs that he us talking to other women, but he denies this. We haven't been intimate in quite awhile and we have only been together just over a year. I get countless excuses for it and he never wants to discuss it. It makes me feel very low. I have said I am trying to deal with my depression as best I can, his response was that everyone has some sort of depression. Apart from some wonderful people on BB, I really don't have anyone I can talk to. 
I guess some days are just darker than others....

I am 40, been married 8 years, I love my wife although sometimes it is challenging to get along, especially after kids. I have a full time job, two great healthy kids I adore (both boys under 5 ). I exercise regularly, I am fit, actually probably fitter than I have ever been, I drink moderately only socially, have a cigarette every now and then and try to eat well (no junk food save for the bag of chips every once in a while). I don't take drugs. I like my job although it does give me anxiety that I do not have a ongoing gig, rather a contract which runs out in 18 months.My wife is in a ""permanent "" job. 
We moved to Australia 3 years ago, for work reasons. I have a small community of friends and colleagues I like. Our household income is good. We live in a nice house. 
So this all sounds pretty good, right? So how come I cannot seem to enjoy any of it? I feel bad putting it this way, and it makes me very mad that I am such a fortunate person and I cannot find  way to enjoy it!  That has been bothering me for a while now. I have always been prone to anxiety, since I was much younger, and for a long time I dealt with it, mostly by drinking and going out. I no longer do that as the costs for me are way too high. Since having kids 5 years ago I have been dealing with some generalized level of depression and anxiety and this has had a massive impact on my life, and most of all my marriage. I have tried therapy - at least 4 times - to no avail yet. I am at intervals sad, angry, have no energy, low libido, low self esteem, no concentration etc. Also some self harm (not too serious). 
I worked very hard through my teens and early 20s to develop a strong sense of confidence and it seems that in the last 5 years this has evaporated and I am going back to a state that I thought was gone - meaning feeling insecure, incompetent, inadequate with body image issues etc..I am always tired... my marriage is falling apart as a result. I have discussed this matter with my wife and I am going to try medication for the first time (have Dr. appointment next week). 
I don't know what else to say really, except that as the title says I need to find ways to enjoy my life again before it all falls apart, we have worked very hard to be where we are and my mental health is ruining it I think.It's been a long 5 years.

The labels I have are Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety Disorder (Post Traumatic Stress). There are quite a few of us walking around with these labels imprinted on us. But what do they mean? I have spent almost three years discussing these labels and the 'feelings' in relation to them and I don't feel I am winning the battle to have myself prioritised over my condition.Yes I have a mental illness. Yes this illness interrupts my life at various times. I have not lost my intelligence - if anything I have gained far greater emotional intelligence and sharpened my intellect through the process of recovery.I'm not sure of the points I want to discuss here or what I really want to say but I am finding all the tools at my disposal to get through the days are not working of late. I have spent six weeks shaking, afraid of noise and light and myself, and I am exhausted. Naturally depression is now taking over.I am still mindfully meditating, limiting my experiences that cause triggers while finely balancing this with an appropriate amount of social interaction and discussing my current state of being with those who will listen. I am exercising most days, eating well, limiting alcohol, keeping to a sleep schedule etc etc This is what I know for sure.There are moments in every single day I feel love and happiness and contentment. I have two wonderful children who so far remain firmly focused in front of any thoughts of suicide I have. Their father is unavailable to them and my parents (who we live with) are unwilling to support us, we have no other family where we live. If I'm not around, I can't imagine where they will end up.I just find it so exhausting to live. Every morning I wake up and immediately go into deconstruction mode. Waging a battle against the part of my mind that wants to take over and unleash the hell that is my mental illness. So once I have that a little bit under control, I go into reconstruction mode. I tell myself the thoughts I need to have and discuss with myself what part of my thinking is logical or illogical. This is for say 30-45 minutes. Then I great my children and start the day. Throughout the day and evening the whole process continues.I can't take medication as I am unable to parent with the side effects. My psychiatrist says I'm trapped between a rock and hard place. We've tried 11 medications and I can't tolerate any of them. It's impossible to live, yet inconceivable to die.  I' m scared of what is going to happen to us.

Hey all,
I'm in my early 30s and i've managed to make a mess of the finances for me and my Fiancee, i've always suffered from Depression since I was young about various things (bullying, not liking going to school, feeling left out). 
When I have an idea though, I am extremely passionate and will see it through, even if it makes me mentally sick. Yet at the same time I have no appreciation for anything I have achieved and feel more of a burden on people than a benefit.
Yet, people that have met me have always said how nice and polite I am, people always seem to remember me and often speak only good things about me. I am the sort of person that would say ""thank you"" for everything, because I am extremely grateful for time that people have for me. I would do anything for anyone, i've lent money to friends, and even people I didn't know that well but had a good feeling about it. One friend ran off with some money I lent him but i'm glad they are not involved in my life in any way.
I've managed to have 22 cars in 14 years, part of this is my ability to be indecisive but part of it was also for my passion of cars and setting big projects (the fun of fixing up cars), a few of these cars I got sick of rather quickly and sold them at a great loss.
To give you an idea, I lost around 20k buying/selling the last 4 cars (each car was purchased under 10k each to give you an idea).
As of April the 1st 2015, we had owed 36k which was separated on 2 credit cards and 1 personal loan (all maxed). Me and my fiancee have been miserable working so hard and not seeing a penny of it 3-4 years into full time work. 

The exact feelings I feel right now are regret (wishing I didn't waste so much money), and utter disappointment in myself that I could get us in this situation. I still feel useless, even though I have the most supportive fiancee in the world, I wish I had saved that money for a house deposit since we are renting.
We took a chance last month and put everything I could think of on the market (sold expensive car for a cheap one etc). We managed to lower the debt from 35k down to 17k in just on one month, sounds like a big achievement but I still feel miserable and useless.
Just looking at understanding my feelings. I wish I didn't have such hate for myself even though the situation is getting better. I feel there is still sadness inside even after debts paid off.
Thanks for your time. I really honestly do appreciate it

Trying again today to get some help. Yesterday was a genuinely a shocker. Never met a Dr so awful. Dr was so inappropriate. I was looking for advice and contacts. I ended up googling the dr and found some other scathing reviews so certain now I am not being over sensitive. I won't name them of course. 
So today I'm jumping on public transport to travel a couple of hours to see my former Dr. of 10 years. The noise and crowds are not things I'm particularly up to handling right now so feels a little like running the gauntlet. On a positive; I'm doing it. 
Wish me better outcomes today.

I know that I suffer from some sort of depression and anxiety. But I can't make myself go to the doctor. I don't want to be put onto magical happy pills. I just want to be me.
 Most days I struggle to get out of bed and only do so because I have children. But there have been some days (just 2) where my son missed a day of school because I crawled out of bed after 9. Worst Mother award goes to me! 
I don't have a job, despite the fact that I've applied for many entry level positions. My inbox is full of rejection emails from those who bothered to reply to my applications. But the thing is, even if I got an interview, I'd be a nervous wreck. In past interviews I focused so much on my body language and whether I'm giving them enough eye contact or not enough, that I miss their questions and turn into a mumbling fool.
At present I am living my 'dream' life. I have a wonderful partner of 7 years and 2 of the best kids I could ever ask for. We live in a nice house on acerage with animals that would make 10 year old me jump for joy. But I don't find any enjoyment in it like I thought I would. I love animals. I volunteered at my local RSPCA thinking it would help with my social anxiety and my need to feel 'helpful'. I went for 5 weeks and stopped. I loved the work, the people were nice, it was a great experience for me. But that little voice in my head convinced me that nobody really liked me and I was more of a hinderance than helpful. And that sucks.
 
So I create mini fantasies in my head of a different life and play them out for a few days until I struggle to find an ending for them. They help in a sense. They put me in a good mood for those few days. But then it's like some sort of devil likes to put things in my path that either remind me of my past fantasy or makes me wish I had that dream life. Example: My latest fantasy was that I was a single vet living in a duplex with my elderly dog and white german shepherd. In my fantasy I would put my elderly dog in a wagon and walk the dogs to the local ice cream place. I would do this every Friday night because I was a loner. A few days later, in real life, I saw an ad for a white german shepherd who needed a single female owner due to behavioural issues. The next day on my newsfeed  I saw a post about a man who puts his elder dog in a wagon and takes him for walks. Talk about screwing with your head!

Hello, just need to talk anonomously, thanks for listening. I've been feeling depressed, having a bit of a downward spiral, not suicidal or anything, just spiralling sad, no sure what to do. I keep pulling myself out and have been good for long whiles however not doing so great lately. 
I think a large part of it has to do with I was finally getting out and connecting with likeminded people in a club I enjoyed being a part of but, a certain high ranking member seems to be insecure  and possessive of ""his"" members and me talking to people he has decided are not to be associated with has landed me in a bad place. Doesn't help he's telling other members lies about things I've never said or done either. There's no other similar clubs in my area and I really miss many of the members which I got along well with.  I could come back (although likely excluded from many events) if I decide to do some grovelling and and shut up and not have anything to do with those he doesn't like, haven't been able to bring myself to do it though. Should I? I mean it'd go against my principles and likely be pretty awkward and depressing when all the others are out at social events I won't be allowed to go to at times but at least I'd get out sometimes. 
I'm a very introverted person who has taught myself to be a ""pretend extrovert"" since  I have to deal with people all day, but to be honest, I often end up exhausted doing this. How do I deal with that? By isolating myself out of work hours so I can recharge. What does that do? It makes me more isolated and basically at work/by myself kind of circle. Little interactions with friends. Most stopped inviting me to anything years ago and fell out of touch. I have no close friends any more. No one I can really talk to. I've never had a partner, I can't let anyone that close. I feel I'll end up alone forever. Certain people seem to insist on pointing that out- ie what's wrong with you. Surely someone would have you? I feel if I were to die, the only side of me people would remember is what I did for a living. Morbid thought I know, but there's so much more to me that no one really sees anymore.

My psychologist and gp both suspected that I had bipolar. After waiting two months for a psychiatrist appointment, he has confirmed that he agrees that I have bipolar. Luckily I was in a good mood so I've held it together pretty well. But it's a big secret. I've only told one person, who has ptsd, so I knew he would be understanding. But how do I tell others? And who??? And how to deal with this diagnosis? Does anyone here have experience in this area?

...and the heaviness appeared. I went to a doctor to get a form filled, yet we spoke of my depression. Well, I spoke of it. I don't feel 30. I don't feel anything really apart from a mixture of failure, decay, instability, worthlessness, irrelevance...list goes on. I've had severe depression since I was young. Diagnosed at 15. My mother doesn't comprehend due to inability or denial. Perhaps doubt. But I am not vain. Not shallow. I'm intelligent. I'm an uncertified psychologist. I'm a mother myself. I KNOW what's wrong with my head. I have all the leads. And when I tell them, I am just another headcase to people. To my mother. More than want, I actually MUST be understood here. It's critical for my sanity. Why cannot people, including doctors, take heed of a persons vulnerability and cries for help? Are they scared? Scared to delve into the darkness with me, or others who have depression? How selfish. Isn't it? I only live for my son. He's everything to me. My little angel. Do I continue to make my mother ""get it"" and accept me? Or should I stop and therefore forfeit the minimal control I might have in life; forcing her to understand and accept her eldest has it hard thus providing some sort of relief for myself.

Ive had the worst day ever today. I didn't get to sleep till after 1pm as I was up watching a movies and drinking after my daughter went to sleep. I woke up feeling like I had no sleep and took my daughter to childcare. I thought if I came home without the responsibility of looking after my daughter that I could go back to sleep but I was wrong. Ive had really bad restless legs and couldn't calm down at all :( and been nauseated as well. Ive been so depressed all day and don't know how ill be able to calm myself down tonight. my daughter doesn't go back to childcare until Friday so not sure how ill get through the week. Im going to try a bath and see how that goes but not sure. my daughter is still awake and its often hard to get her to bed at night as she resists. Just haven't had a good day today and not sure how to get my depression under control. I take anti depressants and have borderline personality and dysthymia :( advice would help.

New here. Didn't accept that I had depression until last night.
Iv been feeling low for months and cry randomly along with constant negative thoughts, many of these thoughts are irrational and I know they sound 'crazy' if I told anyone about them.  I thought I could heal myself, I thought I could think positive thoughts and take myself out of this doom and gloom way of living but that didn't happen. The more I try to be happy the more fake I feel then I feel guilty that I'm not expressing myself to my partner. He has always been my rock and knows me inside out, so last night when he said ""I think you're depressed"" it was like hitting the nail on the head, I was! And I just needed to hear someone say those words for me to believe it. Currently in bed feeling sorry for myself (as usual) contemplating making a doctors appointment, I know I need to talk to someone and maybe even get meds but I'm scared incase the medication changes my personality (if that makes sense). 
Anyone in a the same boat as me???x

Hi all,
my name is Chris I am 25 years old from overseas but I'm living in Melbourne the past 5 years.
i have basically had server depression for over a year, which I am finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, I have totally changed my life around for the better and for the last couple of weeks I have been feeling the best I have felt in the past year. While I still have bouts of depression day to day, I am no where near how bad I was. I would like to meet up and talk with other people that have depression, that our going  tru it or that have been try it. I have tried a support group but I didn't find it to helpful and the people there didn't want to open up or talk about it. 
i just want people to know that we are not alone, and there is nothing wrong with us, I am looking to help who ever needs it and to Let people know that things will get better. I have been tru the worst year of my life and I did not think that I would ever feel any other way than depressed I tought that this was me for the rest of my life. The reason I am writing on here is because I don't have many friends here in Australia its just me and my girl here, and i got tru this with sheer will power and a fight for life. If I could help anyone out there I would or if u are looking for someone to talk to that knows how your feeing I'm here.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask this question.... has anyone ever given prescription medication to their doctor to hold for them because they didn't want it in the house and didn't have anyone else to give it to for 'safe keeping' until they felt better?  I hope that makes sense.If anyone has - did the doctor accept it/was willing to take it, what was their reaction?  I'm not sure how to phrase this - how do you go in and say 'I don't trust myself enough with this in the house' without them thinking the worst?  Will they give it back? Or should I not even ask?  beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Have finally decided to take the first step and get some help, but am not sure where to start. I have been afraid of being judged for my feelings but have decided that it has to be better than continuing with how I am feeling now. I haven't had depression or anxiety before so am unsure of what I should do. For the past few years things in my life have gradually taken its toll on my life. I now feel physically sick with worry every morning and dread the day that is about to start. I can't seem to find a positive in anything I do and I have so much to be happy for but can't seem to get myself out of this slump. I'm going to book in with my GP, with hesitation, but I need to do it. Hopefully I am on the right track and I can start improving myself for myself and everyone around me.. Thanks for listening..

So you know that feeling where you just don't want to anymore, you just don't want to... anything... anymore. You want to get off the train and just be left in the calm nothingness? where you can just float and not have to? On top of that is the overwhelming need to get away, to be nowhere, to sleep for an eternity without interruption, to turn off and shut down. The numb feeling where you aren't sad, or happy or anything in between, you don't feel depressed, your emotions seem to have shut down, your body feels almost like a shell containing the destruction that bounce around inside your head.... it's like something is broken but you don't know what or how to fix it, or even if you want to. Being so distracted most of the time that you don't hear what people are saying to you for half of a conversation until suddenly the noise clicks in and you realise someone is talking to you and have been for the last 5 mins. The lack of concentration at work or while doing things, the inability to focus on one task without being distracted by something else. All of this while trying to put on a fake ""shell"" so you seem normal to everyone else including family, like nothing is wrong.
 
What do you do with that?

Not sure if this is anxiety, depression, reverse ADHD but
need some guidance from you guys.
As background I’m male in my 30s and I have a few stresses
in my life, big mortgage, young child, another on the way, not performing well
at work and worrying about my finances.
My question is, does anyone have a crippling inability to do
anything without it being at the absolute last minute? At work, at home and in
your social life? I know I need to do something, I know what is required, I
know that it’s not that hard but I just can’t do it. I’ll have a simple phone
call to make at work, but I’ll do anything to avoid it and put it off. I’ll
defer everything to “tomorrow” and eventually say to myself it’s too late now I
just won’t bother.
 
All I do all day is cycle through facebook, news.com, other
sites, check my phone etc. I do anything but do what is required of me. Is this
depression? Anxiety etc? I don’t feel sad though, just worn out.
 

 
Its really affecting my work, as my job is a professional sales
based role. All the things I should be doing to improve I just don’t do. Not
performing well stresses me, but I just don’t do the things I know I need to do
to improve, which would reduce my stress... I need my job to pay my bills, the
potential to lose my job also stresses me lol...
 
I would go to a doctor about this but I’ll put that off too.

Hello,
I find myself on the beyond blue website instead of sleeping. My husband is asleep next to me, aware of my pain but at a loss about how to support me. I'm a primary school teacher who has recently moved from Melbourne to Sydney. I suffer from anxiety related depression.
in m early twenties I had an eating disorder. I became very painfully and severely underweight. Throughout my twenties I was distracted by life, studying, working, building a house, getting married. Now, in my early 30s I feel like life is draining my energy. Late last year I was diagnosed with depression. I was given a prescription for anti-depressants and also treatment with a psychologist. Together with the psychologist I made the decision to undergo counselling and not take the medicines (I was not happy with the speed with which they were prescribed by a GP - 10 minutes nor was I comfortable with the side effects, but that's my choice). 
I thought last year my anxiety was caused by the stress at work. I found work relatively quickly in Sydney and have worked a term at a new school. I'm yet to find a doctor or counsellor in Sydney. I'm struggling to work out if I'm simply homesick and lonely (understandable) or if it's the work environment (I am not at all suited to this school) or if it's some other reason or a combination.
I'm scared that my dark thoughts and lack of vitality will come back. I'm sliding into a hole and I'm sure I lack to skills to help myself out. I cry most days. I'm extremely anxious. I feel trapped in this job, how can I leave after only one term, yet I'm also terrified of staying and descending into depression.
i need advice on how to leave one position unexpected while still somehow get a reference that can help future employment. Sydney is expensive and I need to work to pay rent. I fear the financial birder my anxiety and depression will place on my marriage. I'm so scared, anxious and lonely. Would like someone, anyone, to reach out and understand my pain.
Thank you.

I have been an unofficial member of the M.I. club (sounds much cooler like that huh....) since I was a teenager so basically half my life, officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety just over 2 years ago, commenced treatment 5 weeks ago (been on meds just over 4 weeks and have had 1 session with a psych so far).  Just wanted to make sure everyone knew my back story before I ask my question!
I just wanted to gauge how open others have been regarding their mental illness?  Thus far I have only told my partner, my best friend, 1 trusted friend, and my brother-in law and his wife.
I just feel like I'm keeping this big secret from everyone else and wonder if it might improve my relationships if I tell them.  I don't live in the same country as my family so it's very easy just to omit details, to not mention when I am feeling all sorts of bad.  I generally get around this by not calling them unless I'm feeling half stable.  At times this means weeks or months on end without speaking to my parents.  I haven't seen my mum in years.  
I am however visiting them in a few weeks so I'm mulling over if I should tell them or not, and if so how detailed I want to be.  I also am not sure if I should/could/want to tell them about my partners recent suicide attempt.  I just wonder if part of this weight on my shoulders is relating to not letting my loved ones in on the 'true' me.  They know only a filtered version of myself and my life! IE they view my life as if through Instagram :)  and I'm sure most of you have seen those 'life in instagram VS life in reality' posts... that's what I feel like, a bit of a fraud.
I know none of you can tell me what to do and what worked for you won't necessarily work for me - but I just wanted to know what your own experiences had been regarding telling family, friends, bosses, colleagues etc.  Did you feel better?  Did it improve your relationships?  Did you feel they understood better and helped them understand why you act certain ways?  Or did it completely backfire and they treated you differently in a bad way!
Did you go out of your way to tell people?  Or did you just tell them when they asked?  Or is/was this a private battle to be fought only with your chosen few let in on the full story?
Share away please I am all ears! :)  I also intend on discussing this train of thought with my psych next week but thoughts from you guys would be much appreciated.

Hi all, my story is probably similar to some of you hear, but I need to tell it anyway, in a summarized version.I am in my late 40's and on marriage no3. I have 3 children of my own and 2 steps. The steps live with their dad and i and because of this my own children who range from 16 - 25 refuse to include me in their lives, my own parents or sibling don't want me in their lives either.I know that i need to focus on what is under my roof but because of my own family ostracizing me I can't get past the sadness and feeling of a loss of identity. I know that this sound melodramatic but you bring 3 kids in the world and now nothing to show for it, it's tough. My husband has been understanding to a point but is now considering leaving me too. Im on meds for my depression with the occasional benzodiazepines to get me thru bad days. I'm just reaching out here because i don't know where yo start.  Naturally there is soooo much more to my story but just someone who can 'take me under their wing' would be a fantastic start.I need to stop crying one day.

After many years of being manageable the depression has come back with a vengeance. To the point of tears on Sunday. Had a great talk with my partner to let her know where I am at. From that point things changed,and was feeling much better, but today can feel that mood changing. Just want this to stop.

I mean. . It's not like life is horrible. I have a home and a family.. A job... Freedom and relative peace.Sure it hasn't always looked this way.

I have been open with my husband about what depression feels like. . And that I feel there's no way out. I've said that my mind wants to steer my car off the road... I've told about feeling that the life has been sucked out of me. That it's been my whole life..right from childhood and that I'm just. So. tired. That i hate myself more than I ever thought possible... that every single day is an epic battle in my mind just to exist. I've reached out to people I thought I trusted... yet I don't think they realise. . That I just want to cease to exist. I don't really want to die. .. but I can't live like this anymore. I feel like if something happened... even if it was just hospital again - people would say ""i would have helped... I didn't know.... she seemed ok.... she told me it was bad but I thought it would pass""Why doesn't anyone actually care until it's too late? I don't want It to be this way.. but theres only so much help I can ask for.. What's left to do when you feel like you're out of options? I guess I don't expect an answer. I just want something. .. I don't even know what... maybe just to feel like I'm not the only one who feels invisible. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

In a hole dark as night i keep trying to claw my way out feels like im getting in deeper no sun shines in here i have been suffering from depression for as long as i can remember i never knew my family never knew they always treated me like a problem never a person putting me down treating me bad beating me constantly this was just my way of life, isn't this how everyone lives. My first serious relationship i loved him so much he constantly abused me mentally physically and sexually, isn't this what love is, one day he beat me so bad i ended up in hospital we both knew next time he would kill me he left me for a new life i was so lost all i did was drink do drugs and horrible behaviour laying down for whoever would lay with me all i ever wanted was someone to love me care about me treat me like a person. After years in this darkness i finally met her she made me feel like a person for the first time in my life, it took me a long time to overcome the fact that i was falling in love with a woman my family did not approve. She was the person who recognised my depression i always thought that was just the way i was, i have been on medication for 7 years now the first few years i would think I'm ok and stop my meds my behaviour would revert back to my ugly mean dark self . For the past 3 years i now know i will always need medication to keep me NORMAL  My partner has been the most supportive person along this horrible journey of mine she is so beautiful i still question why does she love me i don't deserve her how can she put up with me. Even though i take medication everyday i am in the darkest hole i have ever seen i am waiting for an operation i am in constant pain all day everyday a month ago i had to take leave from work unpaid i couldnt  cope with the pain and the stress of not being able to perform my physical duties which would then lead to depression . Everyday i am at home my partner trys to help me by keeping me busy somedays i just cant get out from underneath my blanket, crawling into a ball and crying is all i want to do. A few mishaps with our house have happened lately the stress with the landlord has pushed me off the edge this feels like the worst Ive ever been i just cant see the light before i left work my boss suggested this website for me i have been lurking watching what goes on for about a month now so um here i am, i am a secret closed up tight knock if you will inside is night i am a lock without a key i am a puzzle no one solves me beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

in a nut shell, after 2 years of an internal mind struggle and then finding the courage to admit there's a problem and trying to find help, seams like trying to get it is as hard as actually suffering it, 4 doctors, 3 psychologists and 1 councilor later and still seams like im a hot potato or feels like im just a number or a lost cause, it was hard enough to admit i have a problem, then actually going to doctors for referal to see counciling which are hard to get in and see just to be referred to some one else cause they cant help! where to turn next? i dont know, seams like sometimes it is easy to stay in my nut shell and let the world go by, i realy dont want to give up but just seams like its getting harder and harder to trust anyone.

Hi all not sure if this is the right place to post. I like to get to the poi so here goes.I don't think I am suicidal but I think about it lots,  I think about how everyone would be better without me and different ways of suicide. I have come to think its normal to think like this. And one day it will either go away or get the better of me. My life isn't bad I am employed have a loving family. Thing get tough from time to time but I don't feel I am different to anyone else in life. The main things that keep me is my mum an daughter and my fiancée I think how sad they would be without me. Sometimes though I think they would be better for me to disappear.  so is it normal is it just me. Are there others out there do I need to do something. I  just confused and want to know I am normal I guess thanks in advance toobeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hey, so I didn't really know where to turn with this and I found comfort in the anonymity that this kind of thing offers, so thought I might try and get something out of my head to see if it does anything.I guess I should start by saying for the last month and a half I have felt pretty lame. Not really enjoying stuff, just turning up and appearing normal to anyone who happens to bump into me. I started seeing a girl in the last two months, which has mostly been great, but she's moving away and last week she told me she doesn't really want a boyfriend, just a friend. I was already feeling pretty worthless by that time with other stuff outside of this (life/work/band etc.), but I think that really stuck the boot in and now I kind of feel as though my worth is at an all time low. I'm struggling to come up with excuses to keep existing, I feel like I'm destined to plot this course of life alone and quite frankly it's a journey I'm really not that keen to see out the end of, especially if this is all that's in-store for me. I had a look at stuff around suicide over the weekend, originally I thought that looking at something like that would scare me into getting better, but I was weirdly at peace with the idea, as if it were somehow justifiable. I really don't want to talk my parents about this stuff, partly because I want to spare them the worry but mostly because I'm 100% certain that they'll tell other members of my family, who then tell more people, so on and so fourth. The kicker in all of this? I'm a Mental Health worker. My job is to help people deal with the things that they are going through, yet I can' help myself? You know, I never thought it would happen to me... but I always thought on the off chance that it did, I would know how to fix it, but alas, here I am, morosely content on fading into the background I've tried to be so different from.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi, I'm new here, nice to meet
you all. I guess I'll start with my situation at the moment and what brought me here.
I started a new job last year that's relevant to my uni degree in law. I was absolutely stoked
about it at first - the working hours were good, the people seemed nice (although
a bit more extroverted than what I'm used to) and the work was easy. However
over time feelings of self-doubt and self-loathing have started creeping up on
me. I began to realise I'm in the wrong profession for my personality type, I'm
timid, sensitive and a push-over sometimes, I'm very awkward around people,
can't interpret social cues and hate making small talk. It doesn't help that my
colleagues are all extroverted go-getters who are somehow able to maintain a
sociable presence at work whilst also juggling 50 million things. Whereas, in
comparison I'm just a bumbling awkward thing who tries to join in lunch-time
small talk only to have 5 different people talk over me when I finally come up
with something to say.


My inability to fit in at work has
really taken a toll on my productivity, most of the time I'd play a conversation with a colleague over and over in my head that I miss crucial work-related
things --I have been criticised by my manager countless times about my lack of
attention to detail. To sum up, I feel incompetent, worthless and a bit of a
nobody at work. 
Also, I have constantly struggled with body image issues and it's become a lot worse this past year. I've started binge-eating to the point I'd feel so gross I'd stare at my swollen stomach in the mirror for hours and cry. Other days, I would starve myself and work out at the gym. I've intentionally pushed away my family and friends by starting trivial arguments. I use my boyfriend as an emotional punching bag and he's tired of me. I'm constantly bitter at other people's success. 
I've tried to talk about it but no one understands, they say 'there are less fortunate people than you, you have pretty much everything. Look at those kids in Africa' -which doesn't help. Today I suddenly broke down in the middle of a parking lot and couldn't stop crying, I guess I felt so ashamed of the person I've become - a terrible friend, girlfriend and daughter. 
I'm sorry about this
whole rant. I know I need help
and I'm truly grateful that I found this forum. I feel like I won't be judged
here and I really hope to hear some of your stories so I know I'm not alone in
all this.
Thank you for
reading.

I believe I have suffered from depression in varying degrees since adolescence, and also have a history of self-harm. However, the past 12 months have been particularly bad. It all come to a head in January when my partner begged me to seek help. I had a mental health assessment with my GP, and was started on a dose of anitdepressants  and referred to a psychologist.I have been to two sessions with the psychologist since then and am taking my medication as required. However, I feel as though I am getting worse...I suffer from constant negative thoughts and believe I have depression and social anxiety. Lately, I have really been questioning my mental health.Getting up and out of bed is a struggle on a daily basis. I work nights so already have a somewhat disturbed sleep pattern, but even when I have had a good nights sleep, I am lethargic and simply don't want to get up.I feel as though loved ones think I'm making it up, and I worry that my psychologist thinks I'm being petty. I feel as though I have no one to talk with and no support available.I struggle socialising with friends, as I become anxious and ruminate over what I said, or what they said, if they like me, my appearance etc.My partner and a number of close friends also experience depression and anxiety, I feel as though I am always putting on a brave face to support them. Even when I do communicate that I need help, I feel as though they make it about them.This further causes me to feel bad, as I feel selfish and rude to think that way about my friends and love ones. I feel I should support them and that demanding help myself is just self absorbed.I have briefly touched on this with my psychologist. I think she's really good and  feel hopeful after our sessions so far. I already feel an attachment to her, but now that is concerning me too. I feel like I like her too much, like I will come across as too needy. Anyway, sometimes I feel like the concern is more on formulating a plan rather than me being heard. This may be because were in the initial stages...I am always so anxious and nervous at the start of the session, I know she will ask how I have been. I want to answer truthful but am held back by my fear of coming across as faking it, pathetic, overreacting etc.I just feel meh!! and wanted to know if anyone can relate to these feelings?

I haven't posted before but felt the need to today.  I'm just so tired of the constant struggle to keep on top of this illness called depression.   I'm in my 40s and it feels as though it's getting worse with age.   I hardly ever leave the house, and I don't want to.  I don't want people to see me like this.   My husband has PTSD and although he's very supportive, I don't want to burden him with my issues.   Some days it's hard to see the point of it all.  My anti-depressants don't seem to be working very well lately. I am just so totally over it all and wish this black dog would just go away. But I know it never will, and that's the hard part.   I don't even want to talk about it with anyone as I can't see the point.   I'm not sure why I'm even writing this!

Where do I begin? Well first and foremost I am starting to feel like a lost cause, I’ll explain. I am 31 years old (32 in September) and due to family commitments I am living at home with my parents. Due to my father’s ailing health and inability to return to work I try to help out by paying the electricity, telephone and internet, as well as helping my mother with my nephew and cooking, but I am constantly being reminded by the media that I am a looser for living at home at my age.I am also overweight (think Kevin James), plus to add to the cliché and I have never had a girlfriend or serious relationship, pathetic right? It’s not that I do not want someone in my life, but I don’t feel I have anything of value to offer anyone, and if someone were to get to know me they wouldn’t like what they find, and would see me for the failure I am. I get nervous in social situations and avoid parties and all costs. So now I feel I am trapped in this cycle of self-loathing and fear of what others are thinking about me, worried about how are they judging me? When people on public transport would rather stand the whole trip rather than sit in the only spare seat next to me it feels like I am to be avoided, so I hide away from the world.I don't have close friends to talk to about this, and I don’t want to bother my parents with my problems as I know they have enough to deal with. I am even anxious writing this here as I am picturing people sitting and laughing at the fat looser, That I should take two spoons of cement and harden up as there are people worse off than me. I am starting to feel like I am standing at the edge of an abyss, and the only thing holding me back is the fact that I do not want to leave my mother alone to cope with the bills, my father’s medical needs and raising my nephew.But the same questions keep playing over in my mind. Is there any hope for me? What woman would want anything to do with a nerd with no relationship experience? and what would happen if I were gone?

I wake up and drag myself out of bed for what I don't know why.  I think I've been on a downward spiral for the last few years. I start crying at the drop of a hat. My temper just explodes. I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't want to leave to the house.  I have no immediate family to talk.  My only brother doesn't seem to care he just thinks about his own life and hasn't included me in his life for many years to him I'm just an annoyance.  Everyday things just seem to be become more of chore.  It's an effort to shower. My Mum was diagnosed with lung cancer and secondary brain tumor over 5 years ago and at time of diagnosis was give 3 months to live. She fought hard and is still alive. I gave up my job to become her fulltime carer. I am a single mum to my daughter who was diagnosed with depression a couple of years ago. I always promised my Mum I would not place her in a nursing but due to circumstances that was not possible and she was placed in care in January this year as it became too much without any family support. Everything seems to closing in. I will soon have no income to support myself or my daughter to cover the cost of rent or where my next meal will come.  It is worth going on. Sometimes I just think why bother no one will miss you anyway my life is worthless.  How can I help my daughter if I'm in this situation.  What do I do??? Where do I go??? The last doctor I saw didn't want to talk about it and said I'm stressed it's just part of life and you have to deal with it.

Hi,

this is my first post on here, it has taken me awhile to build up the strength to do it. A little about myself, I'm 24 f & I have a wonderful supportive partner of 6 years.

I have suffered from depression for as long as I have known (I have not been to the dr to be diagnosed though but this is what this post is about), I also recently found out that both my Mum & Grandma had been diagnosed with depression. However over the last probably 6 months I feel that I am getting worse and worse.

Things range from its feels like someone is flicking a switch & I just turn from being happy to being instantly annoyed about something most of the time its very minor & this feeling can last for days, I get excessively tired even after having a solid 8-10 hour sleep.
Even something as simple as my partner not being home from work by the time I get home which is through no fault of his own (delayed public transport) which he is excellent at telling me about at the time it is running late, but I don't know why, I just hold it against him for days & its like I switch off, I have no emotion, I don't want him to touch me, talk to me, I don't want to watch any tv, hardly eat, & try to push him away in the hopes that he will give up on me & bring up every little minor thing that he may have done that week in the hopes of keeping the argument going.
I want to go to the Dr desperately, because as much as I don't show my partner any emotion during these episodes, it breaks my heart when he says that when he met me my good days were probably 80/100 but now he has recognised that they are at about 50/100 (I hope this makes sense) & he breaks down in tears saying that he just wants me to get help.
Another thing to mention is that in the past 18 months I have lost about 70kg, which I thought me being overweight was aiding my depression in regards to not feeling good about myself, but since loosing the weight my moods & feeling helpless/alone/down/suicidal/no strength to go on, seems to have only gotten worse. I am scared to go to the Dr for the following reasons:
- I don't want them to put me into a clinic & don't want to have to disclose any of the information in regards to my mental health to my work
- I don't want the medication that they put me on to make me worse
- I also do not want to put on any weight due to the medication 
If anyone else had the same concerns as me before going to the DR I would love to hear.

So this is my first step in trying to get myself sorted. Today I finally admitted a lot of things to myself and said it out loud to my partner. I am on anti depressants as to begin with I was taking them for nerve damage. I'm 27 and have just found out that my fiance (we've been together for nearly 9 years, engaged for 3 1/2) is pregnant. While I am happy about this there's something behind the scenes draining me. It makes me angry and sad all at the same time, half the time without warning.  I'm currently dealing with a workers compensation claim. I injured my shoulder back in Sept last year, there was a lot of BS being thrown at me because there wasn't a diagnosis within the first month. Late Dec I find out there's a tear in the joint. This is when I noticed I had started shutting down to friends and family. I didn't enjoy most of my hobbies anymore More BS ensues with the surgeon, it took his office 3 1/2 months to book in surgery. I felt defeated during this ordeal, I couldn't do anything to make it or myself better. It's now 2 months down the track and I'm getting worse. I don't drink often, but when I have recently it's been to the point where my memory is patchy or I make myself sick. I have smoked marijuana for quite a few years, to begin with it was pain management due to an old injury. But recently it has been to become numb to my situation, it's easier to just not think about it than deal with it head on. My anger is getting harder to control and I have no idea how to deal with the extreme low/sadness I feel at the same time. I'm still shutting people and hobbies out, even my partner sometimes.I don't want to burden them with my crap (this is how I see it) as everyone has their problems. But right now I'm drowning, my head is only just above the water. I know my situation isn't that bad compared to most, but it truly is hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel whilst it keeps sucking you back into the darkness.I have had a few suicidal thoughts, but now I have to get it together for my fiance and my future child. I still feel worthless, most people don't know about these issues as I'm the sort of guy to put on a brave face to try and help them.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

i have had depression for many years and am taking antidepressants to help it. too much pressure on myself by other people brought it on. Plus my life with my husband and kids varies all the time. In the good times it is ok but in the bad times i am very depressed,have anxiety,stress and get upset easily. during the past year and half it has been hard as my husband was unemployed and our finances were tough. I would like any suggestions on how to cope and help myself in my down times.

Hi Everyone.
Thank you for sharing your stories. But thank you mostly to those of you who understand and support others.
 
this is my first post (copied from the intro thread) yesterday. 
 
Hi,Ive joined the forums today because Im just not coping with my life. I struggle just to get out of bed in the morning/ I lay awake wishing i wasnt here. I have read a few stories on this thread and I thank everyone for sharing. In a situation where you feel so alone its amazing to find so many of us struggle along.
I have struggled all my life with self esteem and self belief issues. I always find I just dont fit in or am just not good enough. I was only diagnosed with depression after having my children that I got so desperate i just cried in the doctors office. I was on medication for a few years but didnt like the reliance of it and have been off them for some time but i know i need them again. 
I just want to cry all the time. I have struggled to find a job in my town for so long now that I just cant do it anymore. I have applied for 100s of jobs and had some interviews but just dont cross the line. I feel beaten and failed. I am now avoiding social situations because i just dont want to have the job conversation anymore. Why is it so easy for some. Why cant someone help me... I have tried everything but it still to no avail. I want to runaway from this place and start somewhere else. I am well educated (i have a degree and diploma) but cant even get a 'Woolies""type job and I dont know why. Im a good honest person but I now dont even believe that.
This misery is affecting everything. i am snarky and bitter and get cranky at my kids too easy. I hate it. I am scared my kids see me fail and I hate it.I just dont know what to do anymore.
Thanx for reading.

I can barely even figure out where to begin, on the outside it seems as though I have my life together, on the inside I'm breaking.
I work 2 jobs and study at tafe full time, I also am a mum to a beautiful 18month old and have a partner that I've been with for 12 years, I'm 31 years old .
Seems as though I should be living the dream, I think wow, there are so many others probably doing the same thing and worrying about the same thing, why does my issue matter and affect me the way it does?!?!
i work long hours and am trying to better myself for my child so I can get a steady job instead of night shift, why the hell is it so hard for my partner to do the frickin dishes or at least tell me I'm still beautiful when I'm still wearing my pyjamas at 3 in the afternoon???
and that's just the tip of the iceberg, I've put so much stress on myself to pass this course and I'm only in the 2nd semester!!! 
i just....I can't even explain everything that's there, I've written it down, I've spoken to my partner, family and friends and still can't get past this feeling of hopelessness and wanting to run away but stay close at the same time, it's breaking me from the inside!

Hi all,
 I recently shared an intimate moment with a person that I've known for quite a while. We both agreed that we wish we were 30 rather than mid 20's because there are still things that we wish to do while ""unattached"". I like her a lot and she likes me a lot. What really gets me is that I've been feeling those darn chemicals over the last few days that make me long for this persons company, even though I've survived long enough happily being friends. It's quite emotionally taxing.
I feel like I am half the person that I normally am, and that she completes the whole. Which is totally different to how I felt as recently as a few weeks ago. The rational person in me thinks those feelings are related to an underlying sense of low self-esteem. Of a longing to feel appreciated by someone else, because I don't appreciate myself enough.
Can anyone relate to that, as confusing as it sounds?
Ben

Hi, I guess this is my attempt to reach out as I feel like I'm even lacking the energy to begin the process to get a referral for help. Just feeling so very alone, and isolated, sad, guilty, and scared about how dark my moods have become. I moved to Australia from the U.S. nearly three years ago with my Aussie husband and two children. We left due to financial issues and lack of a job for my husband and were thankful to have a new start here with a job for him.  To make a long story short, there are other issues but since our move we have had a lot of family hostility waiting here for us and they've let me know they never wanted us here, my Dad, back in the U.S. has passed, and I have spent months getting my son the help he needs for his autism related issues. Now our daughter is being diagnosed with autism and is not doing well. I felt exhausted before her issues became severe and now feeling like it's a huge mountain I can't climb again.....but I will as I have to for her. The few friends I had made here have taken a big step back in seeing how overwhelmed I have become and there are no offers of help or support, just silence. As a result of the stress, my husband and I are not doing well now. I feel, firstly guilt......because I know lots of people have it lots worse and who am I to complain about our lot. Also because I feel like an absolute failure as a mother and wife. Our house is in chaos, I struggle to keep the kids ready for school each day, get homework done and everything else. I have completely lost myself in that in keeping up with the kids needs, I just do not have the energy to get myself showered and looking presentable every day, I'm ashamed of it but the energy just is not there. I have gone from sadness and crying all the time to just feeling empty and flat. All I want to do is give up and disappear and if not for my kids I would. I do think what a relief it would be to end things or to just have that plan as a back up and it scares me that my moods have become so dark. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

It gets to this time of night. Surprise surprise I'm sad. I'm so sad it hurts my chest and I can't breathe and I cry myself to sleep. I don't have many friends anymore, and my depression feelings are getting more frequent. 
I just feel so alone. So very very alone and I wish I could just lie in my bed and sleep all the time. I don't want to see anyone or go to work. I don't think about dying anymore, but I sure don't want to be around here either. It doesn't help that the person I thought might have liked me... Doesn't even think about me. Nope. It makes me feel so stupid and even more lonely and for some reason I can't stop thinking about them. 
 everything I do wrong plagues my mind endlessly. I get so paranoid. Even if that person were to like me it wouldn't matter because I'd get so paranoid I'd push him away anyway. 
 everyhing I do and say is wrong, I always speak and say the dumbest things that annoy people and drive them nuts. I don't know what to do anymore. I honestly can't stand this and I just needed to vent for once because no one I know here understands. To everyone I'm just dramatic and need to get over it because people have it worse off. And they do, but I can't help it! Honest I'm trying so hard and I just can't! I can't...

Hi all,
I wanted to spread a message of hope. I have recently relapsed into anxiety (with depression). Around 3 years ago, being bullied at work with a number of stress made me have a number of panic attacks, issues with sleeping and eating and just feeling like a walking zombie. I had a melt down and it took me 3 weeks before l was better to go back to work. During this time I saw my doctor and got treatment. It was that hardest time in my life and yet te proudest because l went back to work, lodged a compliant with HR because l couldn't let him do that to others. I don't know what happened with him but that's not my issue. I continues working for 3 months and on the morning l was penning my letter to leave work, I was called into a meeting to be told my job was made redundant. I was going to leave and yet l scored a redunancy payout! 
I made the mistake of thinking l was better earlier this year and l stopped taking my tablets. Considently this, I lasted a fairly long time before my anxiety took over. Add a breakup, stressful work, neighbour issues, moving, sick grandma etc. I am back on my meds and l knownl will be fine. I say l have an anxiety disorder but when it gets out of hand, I get symptoms of depression. 
. Know that depression is just a disease and you can get better (just remember to listen to you doctor!). Tell yourself you are not a depressed person you just have depression. Be kind to yourself as this is a terrible disease and let others help you recover. Practice smiling and force yourself o laugh and be silly - eventually you won't have to :)
 please remember you are not along as this affects far too many and l hope my message has given you hope

Not sure where to start. Text book fantastic partner. 3 beautiful kids. Volunteer at the local sports club. I have the white picket fence. I thought that if I convinced myself long enough in the dream I would be fixed. Clock on clock off next day begins.
My family is not very supportive. My sister points out on a regular basis how Im not good enough at anything and my brothers drain me with all their dramas. My folks are old school. Stuck in their ways and how we should be. Die by the sword of 'what will people think'. And I must keep up the charade. See Im the fix it girl. If there is a problem I fix it. If you need something, I do it. I solve it all.
Hubby is everything you should want. He is loyal and honest and he loves me. Really loves me. And I love him. He knows somethings not right but I just cant let him in. Truth is I know he would be happier without me. I know what you will say but he would. He deserves so much more than I can give. 
I have this huge part of me that I keep hidden away and I wont allow anyone to get near it ever. Its been for so long, I dont know what its like without it. If you come close I will run and if you love me I will hurt you until you hate me. I wont let her get hurt ever again. Noone will know. I have let others in before but they always leave. They dont look at you the same way when they know.
I think, I will just keep busy. Take on more work. Focus on the kids. Fix everyone else and no-one will see. Play the white picket fence game. But im tired. I want to not be but I cant do that to my kids. So back to playing the white picket fence.
It is what it is I guess?

Hello!
I have been struggling since daylight savings has started. I really find that once winter starts coming in, my symptoms increase and I lack motivation and struggle to enjoy the things I used to. Everything is hard - finding energy to go to work is difficult, and then I have after work hobbies I partake in - and lately I havent been going. I really enjoy the activities but I just don't have the energy. 
In the past I was on medication and I chose to stop taking it, more so for anxiety as I'd worked through my depressive symptoms with a psychologist and felt that I was experiencing more anxiety than depression - but lately, the depression is really kicking in and I am starting to feel the dark cloud looming. I hate this feeling and I want to nip it in the bud before the symptoms worsen. I honestly think that daylight savings plays a huge role in this though because I recall the same thing happening last year! 
Does anyone else get affected by daylight savings?

One heck of a lot of people only see their depression as being a bad thing. Well I for one wouldn't be the enlightened person I am today if it were not for my depression. My depression actually got me out of bed one morning (after many many years of suffering) and inspired me to re-examine and understand not only my entire life --- from a premature birth, to why a mother who suffered post natal depression and couldn't care for her baby, to a little boy abused, to a primary school kid left at home on his own, to a suicidal teenager with alcohol poisoning, to a young man experiencing 5 workplace redundancies in a row, to someone with brain trauma and so confused that nothing in life mattered ---- and why these events in my life had made me the individual I was.
Through my depression I discovered that all life's experiences permanently impact the brain of the individual ... whether they be from what is called our ""nature"" experience (DNA - genetic - ethnicity, eye/hair colour, sex, height, disabilities etc) or our ""nurture"" experience (parenting/family influences, peer group influences, religion/atheist, schooling, friends, accident/injuries impacts etc). And because no one else (not even identical twins) shares the exact same ""nature/nurture"" experience (with identical twins perceiving even the exact same events through unique and very separate eyes and even a slightly different physical location), I worked out why I was different to everyone else and why they were different to me. I found the very reason why some people succeed and some fail. Those who succeed simply had a totally different ""nature/nurture"" experience to me ... and if I had had their same experience I would have succeeded in the exact same manner. They were neither better, nor more able, nor more ""superior"" to myself. They were simply lucky. Which meant that I wasn't.
Some of you might find that depressing. I don't. Why? Because through my depression I discovered who I was and why I was who I was. And surprising as this might sound ... not that many people on this planet actually know why they are who they are ---- with the classic Zen Buddhist question being ""Who are you?""
So who are you? Your name  -no! Ethnicity - no! Religion - no! Occupation - no! Qualification - no! Financial or marital status - no! Disability or abilities - no!  And yet my depression was able to answer that question for me.

My depression had for many years been heavily disguised by my success in life.I grew up in a unstable home. I left my birth country at the age of 19 to escape from my family. I had been alone ever since, keeping some contact with a few of them back home but have had no family surrounding me since.The good news is I transferred most of my loneliness to adventuring and fitness. Outwardly everyone sees me as fun, smart and successful. Unfortunately I had no success in any relationship. At the age of 36 I found myself desperately alone.Two years ago a family tragedy occurred. I went into severe depression when I realized how truly alone I was after my dysfunctional family broke up. I never got through the depression, after trying counseling amongst many other things. Now it feels like a chronic companion and I had lost all motivation in life. I am no longer fun and exciting to be around and even my friends start to go. I am in a constant state of despair. When I talk about it now, most people just ignore it or tell me how 'lucky' I am because I have money and a fruitful life. If that was truly the case why don't I feel like living anymore?How do I do this alone, with no friends, no family and no one tthat really cares?

I'm new to this so I'm not too sure how it works..I'm here because I've hit an all time low and really don't know where to turn. my partner and I broke up 6 months ago and I feel lost, alone and depressed. I thought a 6 month grieving period would suffice but the anxiety and depression is getting worse. I finished up my fifo job a month ago so now I'm just sitting around and I guess I have too much time to think. I have no family here (I moved to Australia from Ireland 8 years ago) and I don't have children so there's no great support system in place. I've been to life coaching and counciling and have good friends but nothing helps and I don't know where to turn. I've never experienced this kind of heartbreak and I don't know how to deal with it. Most days I feel like I have no reason to keep going. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Why is that when we are depressed all we want to do is be alone. And why is it that the first bit of advice or suggestion from either a friend , family member or a professional; Is to be in company of others .... ? For example ; My sister rings and says ""how are you ?"" and i say ""Im really depressed, i just want to be alone."" and she says. ""why don't you come over here""
What does one do ? Do you force yourself to be around others, because apparently that is the best thing for someone suffering with depression...
I am very confused and all i want to do is hide in my room.

This probably won't interest anyone but I felt it was the appropriate place to let some stuff go, so I'm ok if no one reads it. I am a just turned 60yo man who cares for his Mum in a very small country community in Western Victoria, gay, educated and just an ordinary sort of a bloke really, albeit one who has a depressive/anxiety condition with an increasing need for isolation. Quite the opposite to what I was once. I am unable to mix with a crowd now or even a small gathering where I make excuses to leave. I just don't understand the psychological changes that have occurred over the past 10 years or so and I find it hard to find anyone who has the slightest idea of what I am talking about. Friends and family try but I can see that they don't get how I am feeling. I use an elephant analogy whereby my depression and anxiety feels like an elephant sitting on my chest and when there is some respite, the elephant hops off and wanders into the jungle and gives me a break. He's always there though, peering at me through the trees and when he's ready, he comes back and resumes his position on my chest. I would never have thought that a psychological condition could have such a physiological impact as it does. The weight is constant. Funny that I don't look for sympathy at all as being in awareness seems to help me cope, its the lack of understanding from those near and dear that frustrates me but then again, how can they walk in your shoes. They just think I'm a fruit loop as I do at times. The other companion I have is the daily thoughts of suicide that invade my space. I've had a preoccupation with it for many years and don't know why. I'm safe while Mum still enjoys oxygen, but not so sure about it later on. There was another tragic case of youth suicide in this town last year and I was astounded at the comments I heard following his death. You know, the same ole ... ""how could he do that to his parents"", ""had everything to live for"", ""who would have know"" the same old ignorant commentary that surrounds suicide. So I decided to write to the regional newspaper explaining depression and how it can lead to suicide. I commented that it is not so much the taking of life that is the tragedy, but the inability to live it. It got published in several newspapers and it has helped this community by way of understanding a little bit. Anyway, its been good getting this off my chest and as I am running out of allowable space to write this, I will say thanks and goodbye.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi everyone, I am new to using online forums so bear with me. Recently I had what I consider a breakdown. My relationship wasn't going well as my girlfriend had become a workaholic and I resented the hours which she worked. Work was incredibly stressful (I am a high school teacher). I could not derive any pleasure from anything. 4 weeks ago it became too much and I was seriously wanting to end it all. Fortunately I didn't go through with it although it was pretty close. Now my girlfriend has left me because she cannot cope with my negativity. I am probably going to sell the house and I have nowhere to live. I was hoping to have a family but that seems highly unlikely. Everyone has been really helpful at work and my friends have been pretty understanding. I feel lost and alone. The future I had planned is gone and the only thing I care about are my two dogs. I really don't want to end up alone. I am seeking help and have a gp which is really good and I am seeing a counsellor. Does anyone know of any support groups in the inner west of Sydney? The easter break has been really tough and I cannot stop thinking about the past and the poor decisions which I have made. Any suggestions?beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

What is wrong with me, and how can I fix it?   I am 54 years young with a beautiful partner (39) and three young boys ( 8, 10 and 13). I have a great job which although very stressful, pays very well and I do enjoy my work. I love my partner and children but seem unable to express it to them. I constantly ignore them and spend time with myself instead. I worry about work and continue to work at my computer well after working hours, shutting them out completely.   It has come to the point that my partner has sought the affection of another man because she is so lonely and she wants to end our relationship. When I found out about this I still thought of myself first and  was so selfish I threatened suicide. This is the lowest point in my life; I am angry, confused, desolate but still only thinking of myself. I don't think I am really suicidal but used this as a tool to seek attention and control. Poor me, love me and stay or I will end it all, then you'll be sorry.   I am working away for three weeks at the moment so this has given us some space for ourselves without the stress of having to interact in a domestic environment. We are just starting to communicate again via text and the occasional phone call. I am trying to give my partner the space she needs to think about things and decide on our future, it is probably out of my control at this time. It is very difficult to not worry and I find it hard to not call or text to try to convince her of my desire to change and hope that she will give me the chance. Its driving me crazy.   I think I am suffering from depression and have been for several years but have ignored it. I am angry all the time and feel lonely even when surrounded by my beautiful family. Little things annoy me and I get frustrated with my inability to control my emotions.   I really don't want the last 14 years to be wasted and to lose my family. It will be so hard on all of us, both personally and financially. I don't want my partner and children's lives subject to this upheaval, how will their lives be affected by the things I have caused to happen? I still hold onto the hope I can convince my partner of my true love for her and the children and she will give me one last chance to prove I can change. Can anyone here help me with tips to try and break out of this cycle and make amends.  beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Ive suffered depression and anxiety for years, I have good days and I have horrible days but lately there all horrible nothing makes it better, it's starting to affect my job because of my constant mood swings, my friends are sick of it and I don't blame them I wouldn't want to hang out with me either, I've tried everything and nothing has helped, I've been on so many different meds and they also have done nothing! I just want to feel happy and normal I don't even know what it feels like anymore to be happy it hurts to smile. No one ever listens to me they always just say I'm seeking attention or being a drama queen, I don't know what to do anymore, I can't even get out of bed somedays all I want to do is lay under my doona and cry! I'm not asking for help or anything at all really I just want to get it off my chest and for someone to listen to me, and ask does anyone else feel like this.

Finding it hard to even say the problems I am battling let alone fighting to get through them. Had a recent medication change which has been a ride to hell. Striving to stay hopeful that the new meds should ease on the negative effects and turn to aid me in recovery from major depression. Its very difficult to recover when things you are trying to get over are still impacting to such a point that it feels the mind just isn't able to get enough traction to set up for recovery. One week or so down on new medication, hopefully the effects will turn positive sooner than later. Having to medicate way more than I wish to on stabilising meds.Best Wishes to all who are also suffering.

I haven't actually done this before so here it goes:
I can't quite pinpoint what I feel is 'wrong' with me these days, but to sum it up, I just feel like i'm losing my mind. These passed two years I have suffered from extreme anxiety for no apparent reason, panic attacks (which thankfully seemed to have past) and what I assume to be depression - although it has never been diagnosed. The strange thing is, however, that some days will be fantastic, I will feel on top of the world. It is often on those days I make silly comments/ decisions such as when I told everyone I was moving away to some exotic destination, or I was going to change my career or, I told my partner we HAD to buy a house that year or rent a new place (that week!!) - which just put un needed stress on him. 
I suffer from incredible mood swings (I always have but they have gotten worse) where I will be happy one minute, absolute down in the dumps next and finally; extremely irritable and generally frustrated. I often verbally take it out on my partner and family and whilst I know it's wrong, it's like i'm watching myself getting irritated and saying mean things but I can't stop it. I'm at the point where I wonder why they even bother with me anymore.
I think the thing that really scared me about all of this though is today, I was driving and missed the road I was meant to turn down. Without even thinking I just put the car into reverse and off I went (there was no one behind me but still...). It wasn't until I saw a car coming that my brain sort of 'snapped back' and I realised what I was doing and how stupid my actions were. I panicked and nearly hit the side rail because of it. I can recall myself doing it but I have no idea why I did..it was almost like I just became someone else for a second.
I'm just sort of at a point now where I can't keep going on like this, and putting not only my family and friends through this but myself as well. I have spoken to my doctor and she has referred me to a psychiatrist but i'm just so scared. I just want to be normal, to wake up and be happy and not dreading everyday at work or being scared that i'm going to become irritable and angry and struggle to stop myself saying things that I always regret and am remorseful for later. I'm also scared of admitting there could be a problem because I know there's probably a long road ahead if that's the case.
I guess I just needed to get all of that out.

Hello brothers and sisters, and yes we are all brothers and sisters in this fight. First off I am not nor would I want to be any kind of professional head shrink, I am just a redneck (yabo lol) that has and still is fighting this demon we call depression. First off a lot of you and a lot of other people have asked. ""Do we ever get better?"" The answer is yes with help, either through medication or simply talking through it, but and as always there is a flip side to this coin, I honeslty think that once you go through a major depression and you come out on the other side we are still in danger of back sliding.
I feel that its kind of like a recovering drug/booze/gambler in that once you go through this beast we tend to start to over think things when we feel ourselves backsliding..we start to remember all the negative things that we went through and we can accidently amplify them. Depression is a true demon simply because it takes so much from us and leaves just a shell. This shell can smile and even laugh..and the outside world only sees this so called tough shell that this demon has left behind, yet this shell of a person that we use to be is brittle and one simple poke and we crumble to pieces. 
This demon takes everything that we once were. Sounds kind of strange but the truth of the matter is that depression takes our logic from us first. You see my brothers and sisters depression runs on a lot of emotions, even the good ones feeling happy down to being sad and crying all the time. We stop thinking and let the emotions run our lives and its very hard to think straight when your emotions are all over the place. And yes you can be to happy or to energetic because you will crash and that crash is a hard one. 
But do not give up hope, do not go looking for hope for we tend to miss a lot of things that are in front of us, but never give up on hope, let it find you. The best advice I can give to you all is simply be. Let go of the past (easer said then done I know) do not worry about the future, and live in this day, this moment. Take care of today and let the future take care of itself. Oh and let yourself be depressed, do not be shamed of it. Everyone. yes everyone gets depressed from time to time, some of us just get it a bit worse then others. 
So keep your heads up, talk to your doctors and do not be ashamed of asking for help. We ALL need help from time to time and this forum is one of many places to seek help!
Be well my family!

Hey, I've been hanging round the site for quite some time before I finally got the idea to join up.
So I've been dealing with depression on and off for quite some time. It's been about 11 years worth of struggling really and the cycle only just started happening again. I used to be alright in masking it but it's now starting to be a strain on myself and the family in that I never relate myself to the family and vice versa.
I do have decent friends that I've been around with. However, they have been talking about work and other things which I've been uncomfortable around so I've left them for that. The reason is that I don't have a job and I can't really relate to their complaints thus far.
I've seen different councillors on and off but I've never really conquered depression thus far. I think that's enough to start off with and I might see how this goes.

hI everyone, I'm not sure if this is where i start but here goes. I think i have depression or a mental health issue as I have been having rollercoaster ride emotions and I'm just not the person i want to be anymore. Im 49 and something happened yesterday that made me realise what a horrible person i am and for the first time, i knew what it felt like to be hated and it was not in a good situation. Ive been trying to work out whats wrong with me without bothering anyone about it but clearly I need help because i am so tired some days and on others i don't want to be here anymore. Im full of anger and rage and chronic pain from back and neck injuries and i feel overwhelmed with life and everyday living and i say things in anger and resentment and i don't know whats wrong with me. I told someone (a relative) yesterday that i am barely hanging onto life somedays. I don't want to spoil certain occasions so ive been fighting it and my husband has no idea and would just think I'm an idiot anyway. I just want someone to understand what I'm feeling and to tell me its ok to be like i am or is it? I don't know anymore.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all, I just wanted to share how I've been feeling in the hope that I can get some advice or tips. I'm a 39 year old male and I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for which I've been seeing a psychologist, but I don't think she's really helping. I'm no expert on depression but mine pretty much feels like a constant feeling of demotivation, lack of interest and enthusiasm in everything from hobbies and interests to social outings. I'm not eating properly and I feel tired most of the time and just want to sleep or lounge around. I can barely get out of bed in the morning to work in a job that I can just put up with in a company that's been going through a restructure over the last 18 months. I'm in the middle of building a house and the uncertainty of job security is not helping. I'm being forced to apply for roles at work that I don't really want and I've started to feel worse with feelings of uselessness and hopelessness creeping in. I've recognised the majority of the way I feel is work related but I've always had a feeling of flatness anyway and a lack of goals or direction. I've spoken to friends and family but don't want to burden them too much and thought this website might be a good place to connect with others. Would appreciate any advice on how to manage this or pull myself out and get back into life again.

If I could, I would, roll up in a ball, let others just go about their lives and I would just give up.  
I am fighting each day.  I feel it in my chest. I just don't care is my mantra. My boys are keeping me on a level, but that level is not exciting or buoyant for them.  I am seeing the Dr. I have a psych appointment in 2 weeks. Have told friends I am depressed.
I hate it. I know there is no switch but if only there was. I would be flicking it to happy.
As I was working full time with depression, I used to use work to cover it up, leaving work going straight home to bed.  Now I am a full time mum, I have noticed that not having to work has shown me how bad it actually is.  And how long the episodes go on for.  This time around 8 weeks. No joy.  
If it wasn't for the boys, if I wasn't seeing the Dr I would give up.  Roll up in that ball, check into hospital and just refuse to get well.
Look I understand that is not an outlook that makes sense. It is how I am feeling.
The Dr booked me to see a Psychiatrist but they wanted 130.00 for a 30 min appointment. What the hell are they going to glean from me in 30 mins?  What a crock, so I cancelled the appointment.
I have been on anti depressants for many years, recently changing brands to see if would help the mood and the sleep - the I just want to sleep feelings.  3 weeks on with the change and still I just don't care.  Trying to sleep as much as I can.  Feeling also like I need it.
ECT - I am wondering if this is the cure for me? I am so over loosing humour, not wanting, not caring, avoiding, hating, hurting, thinking that if life is like this for the next 40 years, why oh why bother. 
I am not suicidal. I want to remember who I am, what I stand for and why it is so for me.
Where is that easy fix or remedy?

Hi, for those of you who are reading this, did anyone have the experience of recovering from depression?
I had a depression a year ago when i was in university, i made a wrong decision and studying something i don't like and i decided to change to study something that i really enjoying. However i suffer the consequences of depression because i think that i am not worthy due to my failure and wrong decision i made in the past. I began to isolate myself from other people, i thought it was a way of coping with my depression (I am depressed in front of other people and this sort of spoiling the mood of people around me ) . At the end, i realized that avoiding social interaction with other people is a terrible mistake and it only makes the situation worst.
 Now i have trouble in controlling my emotion and shy to talk to other people during the social event. I felt very awkward whenever  i  have to interact with other people. Something just feels not right and i think i have to do something to end this cycle, so here i am using my courage to post this thread. 
 Does anyone have any ideas or experiences that can share with me on how you overcome self-isolation that cause by depression ? Or any suggestion? Because i am totally lost and don't know what to do at the moment.
Thank you for your time to read this post.

i don't understand why I feel like I do! I'm on medication but still feeling so down. Crying all the time, tired and just not happy.

I have had anxiety and depression for many years. I spent some time in hospital and had shock treatment which helped a little. I got over that lot, but since, I have felt anxious on and off. I have been on the same medication since the hospital visit which was 14 years ago. Before Christmas last year I collapsed twice and was taken to hospital both times where I was eventually taken off my blood pressure medication. Since then I have suffered severely with depression and have been trying to seek professional help. Everything seems to be taking so long and I need the help right now. We had another great grandson yesterday and I can't even get motivated to go and see him let alone be happy about him being born. If only I could sleep all day and forget about everything. I don't feel like anyone understands how I feel. I'm not sure what to do, anyone?beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi, I am new here. And I am looking for advice please? I have seen so many counsellors over the years, I don't even remember all their names.
I feel like I am unlucky, it is as if I feel the world is hunting me down and I can't escape it. Depression just lurks in the corners of me mind, haunting me. 
My mother refused to leave her abusive husband, who hurt her and myself for years. I had to end the relationship with her 2 months ago and I miss her so much. I feel as if I have abandoned her, and she had a son with this abusive man who I also feel I have abandoned. 
I have a deadly auto-immune disease waiting in my body waiting to strike up again. I have so many reasons to keep my chin up but I just can't, I wonder if there is hope? 
A better future? 
Does it get better? 
Will I be able to sleep without nightmares? 
Can my mind get better? 
I just got engaged in January and I wonder if I should delay the wedding or continue to see it through? Can I put this incredible man, now fiance through this? Will he be happy and content living with a morbid wife? 
So many people don't understand depression, and I am hoping that someone out there does. If so, do you have a hope to get you through? 
How do you get through the day, what motivates you to keep going?

I work for a consulting company and still have a job. But have had nothing to do for many many months and very afraid the company might fire me any day. I tried confronting my manager to ask if I would be fired but he always keeps quiet and does not say anything (he is based on the US and does not want to talk on phone and will only answer via chat). The few Australian managers I know do not respond either. 
Have been applying for many months & do not even get an interview. I have revised my CV more than dozen times. Being in IT for 17 years I thought my skills were valuable...
Wife has been sick for 2 months now and wont get out of bed most of the day...feel sad for her since she is very active and loves the sun but is not able to go out at all. She is also over anxious and every time she speaks to me it's only a ""i'm in pain..."". Doctors as usual have a 2-3 month wait everywhere.
Kids are young and have a demanding school life. 
Wake up (though there is no desire to do so)...get kids to school...do the basic household chores (dishes/laundry/tidying)..look for work all day on internet....pick up kids...do some homework or take them to swimming etc....
Feeling let down and defeated. thought many times about ending it...if not for my kids..
I have no friends or family other than wife/kids...no one to speak to talk about anything...just keep to myself and ride the day...i tried talking to my wife about anxiety of not having work and afraid of loosing job, but she is more worried about her pain so I don't talk to her anymore about it....

I am a single mum of 3 beautiful girls but find I am very limited to being able to work atm, this has left me lonely, isolated and feeling unmotivated and just want to sleep and do nothing, as I have just moved to another area and cannot really get out I am finding strategies of meeting new ppl yet alone friends very difficult. If anyone has any suggestions or wants to be friends it would be greatly appreciated. I just want to get the spring back in my step to be the best person I can be but I'm not doing that very well

Hi,
 I have been dealing with depression for 10 years off and on but in the last year or so it has gotten worse. I feel tired a lot of the time and don't have much motivation to do anything. I am studying at university and I often find it hard to even get to class. I am on anti depressants and have seen a few psychologists about my problems but it only seems to help for a week or so before returning to how it was before. I have tried CBT and ACT and they do help but I feel like I need something else to help me get up and start living my life again. I was wondering if anyone can tell me what I should expect from my anti depressants, when it might be time to try a new one and any other tips I can try?

Hi there,  I am desperately hoping I can find someone who has suffered in the same way I do or can offer some advice. It’s a really hard thing to describe but I will try my best:I have a problem of constant negative and depressive thoughts. I have a great life, a good job, beautiful family and a great boyfriend, but can’t stop my conscious thoughts going around & around. They aren’t really centered around anything in particular, but I seem to have gotten into the habit of constantly being aware of my negative thoughts kind of thing. Like I can’t stop my mind thinking or searching for something negative. For instance if I am outside going for a peaceful walk I will think negatively, if I am at work I think negatively. As soon as a I find myself even coming close to enjoying myself, my mind ticks back to searching for something negative. I suppose the only real basis of my thoughts is “what is happiness, are you feeling happy right now? What is the point anyway?”. I used to love working out but now I struggle to even go to the gym because it allows too much time in my own head. I would rather be in bed reading or watch a movie because at least then I can find some escape….   It’s such a hard thing to describe and I don’t think I am doing a very good job at it, but it’s like I have lost the capability to just let my mind just drift off into a day dream, experience happiness on its own or ever just relax . I am always consciously fighting with my own mind. It’s sooo exhausting and most days I can’t wait to get to sleep so I can finally let my mind go. When I wake up I automatically welcome the negativity and fighting back in. Some days if I really let it get to me I get really really depressed and even suicide thoughts sneak in. I would never actually do that, but sometimes I think it would just be easier...  I have seen a psychologist who didn’t do much at all except tell me to practice mindfulness. I have been trying, and meditation seems to work when I am actually in the process of doing it, but as soon as I’m finished my usual racing negative thoughts begin again. It really is the most frustrating habit I have gotten myself into and I seriously have no idea how to allow myself to let it go. I have read up about how you should accept the thoughts and let them go n all that, but so far it just isn’t helping.I wish I could go back to before all these messed up thought patterns and be the happy careful girl I used to be :'(beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Im new here, but I just needed this out...I'm so confused but I'm finally admitting to myself today I'm depressed...I know I need to see someone but that is gonna be near impossible today and our local hospital is useless...I feel like I must be the reason my marriage of nearly 6 years is broken down....my husband doesn't appear to care and has been pushing me away (and telling me to stop pushing him away...I'm not though...at least I don't think I am)...I can be curled up on the floor crying an my husband would appear angry that I was crying and ask me ""what  are you doing?""but now we are separated....his decision....not mine.....I'm not coping well today....as I realised this morning all our mutual friends appear to be talking to him and ignoring me....I'm feeling so alone...I tried to voice this to my husband when he came to pick up our son and he just looked at me and called me stupid...I can't do anything right anyway!writing this down it seems I've been conditioned into being depressed, and I dunno how much truth there could be to that...I know my side may be bias but I need it out! I feel like I'm eating my time here and I'm just a pain to everyone i just feel like no matter what it's never gonna get better.....I'm gonna be like this forever....

I don't feel like I am getting any better, my antidepressants were changed as the ones I was taking were causing all sorts of side effects I have been on the new ones for  5 days now . My sessions with the counsellor have been hard and I leave them feeling good, however, last night I seemed to have a relapse and had suicidal thoughts and spent most of the night crying the same as I am doing now. I know Im supposed to do things however, I don't want to do anything.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Can anyone share with me their experience with disassociation? I've recently learned that that thing I do where I space out, or ""go elsewhere"" and have all these blank spots, has a name.
Is disassociation bad? Is it a symptom of something else?  What can I do?

Hi my name is kerrie. Nothing seems to go right for me I moved to another suburb 8 years ago and since then everything seems to be going wrong. I got married which ended after 2 years due to my husband's intravenous drug use and DV. I moved house then met someone else we were together for 1 1/2 years which also ended due to his alcohol addiction ; DV and controlling attitude which only ended one month ago. Now I have decided to move back closer to my family. But I lost my licence for a month so this makes everything so much harder. I just want to move with my 4 children and start a fresh life but nothing seems to go right I applied for a house last week and didn't get it my house is packed ready to go but I feel I am sinking further into depression I now have no motivation at all I just want to sleep all day I don't feel like going out or doing anything. it would just be nice if everything wasn't such a challenge and things started to go right for me for once.

Well what a pita I mow grass for a living (used to anyway) I have had to give away over half my clients as I couldn't service them. Now I can't even leave the house with extreme anxiety. I judge my days by getting out of bed and putting on my work shirt, someday's I finish getting dressed and go to work.
I have had this illness for 30 plus years,have a great medical team behind me,a fantastic wife.But with all this I still cop a beating everyday. So as I say have lost a fight today but am going to win the war. (This is just a little rant)

Hi, 
      Yet again going through depression.. 
Not sure what path to take any more.  
Yes meds is step 1 but through all this I have hurt my relationship with the most amazing man.  He is not sure where our future is now after another one of my melt downs.This makes it all so much harder to know I may not have him.
Why do I push him away when it gets hold of me. I hate it and myself right now because I may have lost the love of my life.
I just want to be well and happy. Have a great life with him.  Just overwhelmed with sadness, fear and guilt.
Will this pain ever end and find balance

Hi, I am new to this. Haven't really spoken to anyone about how I feel, just slightly mentioned to two friends quite a while ago but that's it. Don't even think they remember anymore. I haven't been diagnosed, don't really want to go to a GP. I don't want to tell someone how I feel who just listens to you because they get paid for it. Also, I don't want to tell anyone I am close with to not make them feel bad. I have moved to Australia a few years ago as I thought I might be happier here or at least I would be ok with being by myself as I didn't know anyone here. I found friends but moved again because of a new job so I am by myself again. I don't have problems meeting or talking to people but currently I don't want to meet anyone anyways. I feel so lonely, especially not having a partner - have been single for a long time - and this is what probably frustrates me most. I feel like I won't find anyone who really cares about me. I don't want to do this anymore but I would feel bad for my siblings and parents if I did something to myself. Didn't really want to talk about anything and especially not whinge as I know this doesn't help but I don't know what would help. Depression medicine would be good but that means talking to someone who doesn't know you and doesn't care about you. Anyone else feels the same?

Where do I start? Basically, I've been engaged now for 1 year to my Partner.The wedding is this December and i'm absolutely scared. Some days whilst at work I will be happy and grateful that I have such a loving partner and then the next day, part me will say ""get out!! leave her! If you marry her, you'll be a slave for the rest of your life!""We've been together for 5 years. I love her soo much but she does have pretty damaging traits. She is a control freak. It comes from her high anxiety. But still her bossiness is very hard for me to deal with. She loves to plan each and every thing that happens whilst I love to go with the flow. I feel like I can't even have one weekend that isn't scheduled.We're currently going through all the wedding preparations, its so heartbreaking because I'm not sure if I can go through with it.My dream has always been to backpack asia for 1 year on my own. Then return to Australia and live in a hippy commune. Part of me wants to go away from this world that I live in, Sydney. People seem so stressed and unhappy. Im one of them. Im sick of this life of working my butt off so I can buy another fancy table that I hate, but because my soon-to-be-wife ""needs one"". I hate pretending to be this educated yuppy that she wants me to be. I'm not, i'm a laid back, chilled guy. I hate materialism. Part of me says stay with her. We've had some amazing times over the past 5 years.I left my great and stable job of 3 years 1 year ago. When I left that job i thought i'd progress to the next challenge. No..no such job ever came, I've been doing odd jobs ever since. I wonder is it my partner that i really want to leave, or am I just really unhappy with my life in general?Why did I propose to her in the first place if I didn't want her to be wife?I've been seeing a shrink lately,but she won't give me an answer. I need to know, do I stay with her and risk being a slave husband? or do I leave her into the big bad world again? Ive my partner told her that I'm having doubts a few times since my doubts arose (3 months ago). She was broken,which was so so hard for me to see. She said last week, she needs an answer now as I can't keep waiting for an answer but I don't have one! My dad says go with your gut feeling but I'm not thinking straight at the moment.My gut feeling changes daily.The big bad world for me is not a good place at all. I hate loneliness. I've suffered from depression and anxiety now for roughly 8 years.Please help!

Hi,I'm new to this site but i thought i would give it a try. I have been diagnosed with depression for a month or so now and started some medication but i don't feel like it is working and want to know if there is anything i can do by myself rather than going to a professional. I don't like the idea of going to a psychologist as they are just getting paid to listen to my problems, which i don't think are worthy of sharing. I am numb. Emotionless. Or really sad 90% of the time. I struggle to get out of bed and i have increased thoughts of self harm, yet don't want anyone to see or know so prevent myself. I am constantly putting up a facade to my friends and family because i don't want them to see me as weak, hopeless or powerless. I don't want their pity. I need to help myself so i don't need to tell my family to be able to go to a psychologist. Please helpThanks

Hi everyone. I haven't posted for a while. Been feeling flat and low. I have had the last 4 weeks off work, supporting my wife and looking after our new baby son. Has been great being there at this special time but it has also been overwhelming. I go back to work tomorrow and wonder how that is going to go with a lack of sleep. 
Have been managing my depression ok for a while but some early warning signs are telling me I could be on the way down again. Haven't exercised at all for over a month, got no energy, losing interest in things and feeling hopeless again. Not sure what I can do to arrest the downward spiral as I don't have much time for me at the moment. My wife is relying on me as she is still recovering from a caessarian and is feeling overwhelmed with the new baby and our other young son. Any thoughts or advice would be great.

Nz born female - history of depression for...wow just worked that out ...9 years now. have been medicated on and off throughout that time. I have gained an excessive amount of weight after a personal tradgedy and am now even struggling to get out of bed due to my depression. My weight is getting me down I had been doing so well as I have had a PCOS diagnosis and need to lose weight for medical reasons but now the 'black dog' is taking on my life again. Have had history of health problems eg - tonsillectomy, gallbladder removed etc...lots of time spent in hospital and a lot of ongoing medical things.
My fiancée works 4 days on 4 off but we are in a backward little town with nothing but a Woolworths. I am literally going insane. Everything else should be great as I am recently engaged, wedding to plan, not having to work (choosing to turn down work as my anxiety and depression continues to mount and I don't like confrontation. 
I miss having my family as a support network. Skype and phone call is ok but I have nothing really to say as how do you tell someone else what you are feeling when you don't even know yourself? 
Fiancee tries to understand but thinks he can fix things. I can't be 'fixed'. This is who I am. He is not doing anything wrong (except having me in this tiny remote town away from people I love) I'm making friends, good ones - but I somehow doubt any of them have or are battling the demons baying at my doorstep, 
 I could stay in bed for days. I could lay on the couch and stare at the wall. I'm not sad and crying - I am numb. And for most people the biggest misconseption is that depression is sadness. It's a whole lot more than that.
i am on a slippery slope and I need to reach out but it's difficult as my life looks 'great' so I feel selfish for feeling this way. But all I want to do is either numb my pain further or escape the numbness.
Oh God - what a terrible mess I am in.

                   Depression

Depression comes like darkness falling.


Taking willing souls like rivers flowing.

Slowly consuming like big fires burning.

When hope is lost our mind is faltering.

Turning minds into raging kaos; a warning.

Somewhere deep, dim light's still glowing.

Take one more step, just keep on going.


The mind revives with desire and longing.


With hope filled promises and future showing.


Just dont give up without ever knowing!

Hi,
My name's Bec and I have had depression for about 3yrs now. After just recently going through a bad patch I am now getting  better and feeling more my usual self. However one thing I struggle with is motivation, its so easy to just sit and watch TV all day. I have a job and study, which I love both but I cant seem to get motivated to work or attend class, even little things I enjoy doing like going for a walk seem like such an effort.
Anyone got any advice on how to get motivated and keep motivated to do things?
Thanks :)

Hello,Well after years of knowing that I suffer on and off from depression (self diagnosed), it has gotten to the stage where it has consumed me and I feel like it is ruining my life. Something needs to change and acknowledging it I guess is the first step. I am sure I don't need to tell people how I am feeling, the sadness, the hopelessness, the feeling of worthlessness, the anger and negative thoughts. I haven't been able to truly admit to even my partner, let alone anyone else that I am spiraling out of control into this blackness. I'm scared....scared to admit it, scared of his people's reaction, scared I can't come back from this.There are the added factors of having returned to Australia after years abroad, then moving cities for love, of not being able to find work and the endless battle with a stubborn 10kg adding to my poor self esteem and confidence.I don't want to go on medication. I need to find help, I need to find me again. I'm scared this is who I am and it's not the person I want to be but don't know how to change it.Until recently I had never thought about suicide but lately those thoughts pop in every now and again...life just seems too hard right now and nothing seems to make me happy. I don't laugh, I don't feel good, I don't enjoy anything.Is seeing a psychologist or therapist or counselor the first step? Can I really overcome this or is this the way my life will always be? I want to be a mother but I couldn't imagine having children while I am like this.Sorry, I'm babbling and not making any sense.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

For the last few years I have suspected that I have been suffering from depression. I feel like there is no purpose in life, I am constantly tired and lethargic, I cant concentrate on anything or make decisions. I feel kind of empty all the time, like even when I am doing fun and happy things I feel like I am only laughing and enjoying it as a front to fit into society. The only time I genuinely enjoy myself is when I am drunk.. Which I dont do often because I cant handle the hangover depression. If I had my way I would stay in bed forever. I have no motivation to do anything, ever. The funny thing is, I cant remember a time where I didnt feel like this, I just put it down to being introverted or  I think maybe this is a personality trait of pessimism rather than depression? I mean, its not like I cant feel happy, sometimes I do.. Doesnt depression mean U have an imbalance and physically cant feel happy ever? 
although all these are classic symptoms of depression, I cant bring myself to seek help for them. How do I know if this is actually depression or whether I have just created this situation in my mind as a way to justify my negative mind? 
I dont trust talking to a GP, i went once and she read through the checklist of symptoms and said yep thats it.. But how do I kmow if my symptoms are real or if I have just fooled the doctor by what I think is the disgnosis?

Hi,I am new here, not quite sure what happens with these forums or how much you are meant to talk about etc.Last week I was diagnosed again with extreme sever depression with suicidal tendencies. I have been in and out of depression since I was 14, I am 31 now, this time is worse than all the other times. I am so annoyed at myself that I allowed it to happen again.I try so hard to see the positive in things, but everything is a struggle, from getting out of bed, to brushing my teeth etc. I am back on medication and seeing a psychologist and have a great support network yet I still feel alone in this battle. But this time I feel as though I can't fight it.The other times I wan't working so I could focus on getting better, this time I am working long hours, commuting etc and just can't stand being at work, I just want to stay in bed all day.I hate feeling like this.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I've been depressed for over one month now.  It's not the first time.  I should be used to it.  I've been on SSRIs on and off for over twenty years now.  The mistake I made was thinking I could do without them - lulling myself into a false sense of security as it were.  I'd become interested in Buddhism and meditation as well as Stoicism.  This had given me hope of a way out - ergo no need for medication.  WRONG.  I spent over five weeks carefully weaning myself of my medication.  So far, so good.  I lasted about another two weeks with nothing at all, full of a supreme sense of achievement. And then crash.  I can only conclude that a depressed state is my default setting.  Either that, or the SSRIs rob you of the ability to ever again manufacture the necessary chemicals naturally.This is day 17 back on the pills and still no effect, bringing back the old, familiar feeling of being stuck beyond the point of no return.  Also familiar, is the feeling that the depressed thinking is right on the money, and the medicated thinking is a type of delusion.  For example, I really am a total screw-up - have been all my life.  I was a strange, sad kid.  Because of my neurosis acting as some kind of a demon standing between me and other people, I've ended up totally alone, and that's not likely to change.  The terrible lonliness I feel is completely real and not a symptom of depression, or rather, medication in someway alleviates lonliness as well as depression.  I know I'm not going to change; I'm too old.  I have nothing to look forward to except the devastation of old age.Tell me I'm deluded.  Tell me self-loathing is just a symptom of depression.  I don't think so.  I really am pathetic.  I try to dwell on the thought of all the people in far worse situations than myself.  This just seems to make myself and my self pity even more contemptible.  Yet still, I don't have the courage to end it.  Why wouldn't someone be self-loathing?beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all, I'm a newbie here,
first time poster. Im a 29 year old female, kinda nervous to be here but here
goes. I was just wondering if anyone else out there relates to over eating on a
regular basis, due to depression, or even those who have low days without
having diagnosed depression.. . I don't want to get caught up with the
label of 'eating disorder' and mental health illness, basically its eating to fill a void and eating to the point of feeling sick..... aka binge eating. This is my life, and once apon a time my eating was mostly in
control, it has gotton worse the last few months, and I am feeling less and
less in control 
So, if anyone feels like sharing their
story, please do. I really just am trying to feel less alone at the moment and I am not trying to judge or compare......so, Id love to hear from you, and thanks everyone.

Not a topic to beat around the bush. Yeh, suicidal thoughts or plans. How many of us sufferers of depression have been there?A statistic that blew me away was average suicides in Australia. About 2200-2500. Males are four times more likely to than females. Now a days thats more than the national road toll.What can we do to secure our own future so we dont go down that path because of the numbers that do go all the way many are suffering depression. Our demons take their toll on our well being, our daily life and we send our family and friends packing even though it isnt intended, we do it anyway. We have limited control and that brings me to a point, an important point for the depressed contemplating the end of your life. To think outside the square for a few minutes before you continue on. Disconnect with your contemplated journey for a few minutes to think of the following.1.Think of your loved ones, the sadness and grief they will experience. So sad2.Think about an immediate change of environment3.Seek help. You might be thinking you are tired of seeking help but do it! Again and again you might need help but thats the way it is.Many of us know the internal pain, the numbness, the worthlessness, the feeling of tears rolling but we dont know why. Like anything in life that is negative and uncontrollable there is only two ways to silence those demons  One is the selfish way and I wont consider it a fair option for your loved ones. the other is to reverse it. How do we reverse suicidal thoughts?Change of environment? It can help. Walk away from that terrible direction. Walk anywhere. If you are that desperate then try anything life can offer so you survive. A day, a week, a month later having moved from your home, sort a job in the outback, had a holiday, toured around etc you would look back and realise that pathway was not a good plan. It was selfish and it was defeating. You'll feel proud you survived. An accomplishment. You beat it, you squashed those demons, not fully but you turned around from that path of destruction.There have been threads here on this forum that have touched me. The one that totally transformed my thinking was ""think b4 you act""  google it with the words ""beyond blue my life has changed because of 1 decision horribly wrong"". That poster helped me too even though my thoughts of suicide have diminishedIf you are heading towards that direction consider loved ones. Realise your feeling of despair are temporary.

Soooo, I'm about to turn 29 and couldn't be more un happy. Typical story I have everything and more than I've ever wanted and worked for evey bit of it. I don't buy into the poor me thing and don't really care to be bothered with it. I feel that my life is a complete shade of black and everything around me is blacker. Nothing interests me and I don't really care because I just want to be left alone by everyone. I can't help but feel like a whiney silver spoon fed mummies boy because I feel that most people with these thoughts are. I have achieved everything in my life on my own without the help from anyone and like it that way. Now most professionals would say I'm lonely and un loved but wrong I have a loving wife, friends etc.lol. insecure?  Lol. Love my life and everything I do and have. I'm not suicidal because I would rather live with this than take the easy way out. Summary - every second of every day of every hour it never ends and theres nothing we can do about it.

Hi all,
The issue I've been facing, is, I believe repressed emotions/thoughts.  It has been building up since 2012 when I went off medication and had extreme anxiety (social)/depressive symptoms return.  At that stage I didn't do any therapy, instead got on with working/socialising.  I acted my way through social situations and got to a point where I was comfortable enough.  In the past where I had used mindfulness, this time I got myself through and was coping okay.  It wasn't until 2013 when I bgan experiencing anger (which I kept inside) toward my Mum.  Thinking it would fix the problem, I moved out and lived in a sharehouse.  I then began feeling annoyed at my co-worker and left that job.  After a few more jobs I realised something wasn't right mentally.  I didn't really realise at the time I was unhappy and having stronger symptoms of anxiety/depression.  I left my then current job and in 2014 went down to Rockhampton to stay with my relatives, in hope I could move forward.  I ended up in a mental health clinic for 5 months and tried on numerous medications.  I was wanting to try mindfulness, because that is what worked in past, but something in my head is preventing it from working.  
I've come home and had many ""breakdowns"" because I have this feeling in my head.  The closest I have read about is a guy who had lots of emotional stuff happen to him, and instead of feeling his emotions, his head took control and he was lead by his head/thoughts.  It's almost like I have a numb feeling in my head and I can't just be in my body (feel).  I've been operating like this for a few years now.  I've been told I need to ""love"" myself and I've also been told I'm a ""thinker"".  
My current psychologist has tried to get me to be in the present, it doesn't feel possible.
I'd really like to have that headspace I had when I first did mindfulness.  I don't know whats happened in my brain.  My life just feels bland and I don't experience any true joy or happiness.  It doesn't quite feel like depression although I do feel down about the situation..
Can anyone else relate or understands emotional/thought repression.  This is what feels has happened.
Thankyou,
Lauren :)

hey so I don't know how this works but I just need to talk to someone...I'm feeling downright useless, I don't know why I wake up in the morning and have been thinking dark thoughts lately. I'm frustrated and angry with myself and my lack of motivation or direction. I find myself bursting into tears at the slightest emotional prompt. I was seeing a psych for awhile but stopped going because he didn't even listen, just stared at me blankly and put me on more medication... I don't know who I am, who I want to be or what I want to do with my life. guess I'd like some reassurance that it's not all pointlessbeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I have been thinking this for a while. I know hopelessness and worthlessness are feelings a lot of people with depression have.
But what if you really are actually failing at life not because of depression or bipolar but just because you're a loser?
I am broke. I have 3 kids, some weeks I worry how I will do groceries. My husband works full time and I run my own business which is completely failing and I make hardly any money. Our bills and debt are piling up and it feels so irresponsible and insecure. It is constant stress. FAIL.
I am so unhealthy. I have diabetes and I don't act like I do. I eat crap and don't exercise. I take my medication most of the time but I need to take more in the morning. I never do, just never remember. FAIL. I'm fat and unfit and have no motivation to do anything about it (no really, I'm fat. I am 100+kg). 
My marriage is ridiculous. I HATE intimacy of any form, my husband asks for sex nearly daily and it feels like he only asks me so I feel as bad as him when I reject him. I want to be left alone. I want him to leave me alone. I am pretty sure we are headed for separation but no one wants to be the one to decide. FAIL.
I have no close friends. I have no one to confide in. FAIL.
Two of my kids are in therapy. Fail...
I have had multiple therapists and marriage therapists and the last one we saw pretty much kicked us out. I am currently not seeing a therapist, I feel completely unable to be helped at this stage. My self loathing is too deep, no one has ever been able to tap in deep enough nor earned my trust enough to even scrape the surface. I feel completely defective in so many areas. Unreachable.
I function. I work. I cook. I parent. I get up in the morning, I barely get the kids to school on time but they get there. I am HAPPY and CHEERFUL and if you knew me you would think I was just fine with no problems at all. 
I am always thinking wow, this is really it. This is my life. The only person that can change it is me and I just can never seem to do so. Its all just too much.

Hi all. Like many others I've suffered depression for as long as I can recall. Back as far as 3 or 4 years old I realised after attending an in patient program for 3 weeks where I learnt about shame based development. First major anxiety attack at 17 in 1987 frightened the life out of me and have continued intermittently over the years.  To add to this I had a unfortunate sexual experience with a member of extended family around 6yrs old  which has played which has played havoc with my sexuality since falling into a nervous breakdown due to some drastic activity by my wife around club funds in which our family were members  of. Social fallout, major stressors on myself, immediate and surrounding family also the collapse of a major part of my business due to me being affected by rapidly worsening depression and a huge tax dept via my wife misappropriating my BAS payments created the spiral. On that as mentioned above, I experienced uncomfortable feelings re- unwanted same sex thoughts. These were not an issue or regular pre becoming unstable, therefore never needed acting on. I have been married for 12 years and been happy with heterosexual intimacy. However since the intrusive and ruminating thoughts accelerated around my breakdown and in recovery it feels as though my mind is split, rupturing my pre breakdown confidence and being thrown in disarray when the depressive effects are overrunning my ability to deal with life in general. Things such as financial, family and marital issues have become extremely stressful and confusing resulting in suicidal thoughts at times. But, I have periods where I gain strength and clarity amongst the manic episodes where by things aren't obsessively ruling me and I am able to moderate and contend with the irrational guilt & fallout of the whole experience. I have been suspect of Bipolar or BPD due to struggles over the years in consultation with practitioners, but right now really need aid in getting out of the dangerous level of depression. Meeting with Physiatrist this Thursday to consider med change or more.  First post so sorry if not appropriate in any way.

Hi all,
I an new to the forums and am looking for advice. My wife has pointed me to the website and would like to share how I am feeling. I am not sure if I am depressed or not.
I am married with 3 kids, a decent job which doesn't cause me any stress and am financially stable. However, I do not care about anything at the moment. Family, friends and my job. Nothing in my life excites me or makes me happy. i am angry all the time and yell at my wife and kids whenever I talk to them. The smallest thing will set me off. I'm drinking more than I should to probably numb my existence and this in turn causes massive issues in all my relationships. I have no close friends due to being grumpy and this in turn makes me sadder than ever. I have been to the doctors and been prescribed pills but they made me feel more distant so I don't want to do that again. I feel guilty over the things I've done in my life that has hurt others. This guilt is tearing me apart. There is more but that's all I want to get off my chest for now.
any advice or pointers would be great.

Hi ! I am new to this site, but needed to talk to someone as I can not seem to stop crying, each day I seem to do less and less which makes me feel worse, but I dont know how to stop. I am 41 years old, very overweight, with two beautiful teenage daughters aged 17 and 14. We run our own sucessful business, which is very stressful, and also keeps hubby very busy. We have recently purchased a beautiful home set amongst 7 acres of gorgeous gardens ( I should be happy!) I am going through early menopause, which is probably not helping. My job keeps me fairly isolated, I do not get to connect with people much. I live in a small country town, where everyone knows everyone. It doesnt seem to matter how nice I am to people, I can not seem to make friends. I only have one friend, who has her own issues with a child with cp. Hubby and I love each other, but due to my weight issues, I vary rarely will be affectionate with him, because my body is so discusting to me. I have never been an intelligent person, and even though we run a successful business, I feel people warrant that to my husband, so I guess I just feel worthless. I am so lonely, so sad, everything anyone says I overanalyse and take to heart and spend days crying over. I get so angry at myself, because I have nothing to be depressed about. I have family who love me, a nice house, job. How would I cope if there was something seriously wrong? I feel ilke I am such a bad parent because my protective instints go overboard when other kids or parents say things about my children., to the point I hurt so badly inside, i cant control my emotions on the outside. My kids end up not talking to me and telling me whats going on in their life because they know I cant deal with the negative. I know I need to interact more with people, I did try a few weekends ago, I invited quite a few people to my house for a housewarming, and barely anyone showed up. I feel the more I try the more people dont like me. I have a daughter who is quite good at sports, and she receives a lot of jealous comments etc. I am at the point where I am bursting to say something to a couple of mothers and kids, but I know if I do , it will wreck things for her, but their comments just eat away at me.  Does anyone have any ideas how  I can find people who might connect with me, without to much more rejection, which I dont think I could cope with? Sorry for the long winded whinge!

Ok, so I think I have depression and I don't know what to do next. It only really hit me recently when a friend made a comment and when I actually did some research I think I might have depression. Problem is I don't want to speak to anyone I know about it I don't want to seem like a sook or like I'm looking for attention-also the reason I don't want to see a doctor because I am scared they will say nothing is wrong with me and I'll never feel better. Im 24 and I have become so withdrawn. I used to be quite bubbly and outgoing but now I don't want any attention on me ( it's so bad I avoid pulling up directly beside cars because I don't want anyone to look at me). I am not excited about anything anymore and I can't see any future for myself and I am always so tired. To try and describe it I feel as though I'm stuck in a tiny frosted glass box, everything outside is blurry and everyone outside the box is going about their lives in fast forward and can't see me in there and have forgotten me. I feel like everyone is always annoyed with me. I've lost all my confidence I avoid eye contact with people and I just feel like it will never get better. Strangely though I get weird bursts of happiness/energy for about an hour at a time and then crash again. I don't feel connected to anyone anymore. My best friends/family feel like strangers. 
I want some honest opinions - do you think this is depression or just a phase? I've felt like this for about two months now and it just seems to be getting worse.  
 Thanks - sorry for the long post

My wife and I have different types of depression so this might not suit all.
I felt depression coming on. Maybe I'm lucky but I get signs, mood swings and sadness. The sadness maybe from dysthymia. At any rate it as coming on 3 days  ago. This cycle normally lasts around 10 days and I push through it. Last time about 6 weeks ago I couldnt push through it. This led to me approaching it differently.
Instead of staying home I asked my wife if she'd accompany me for a drive about 5 kms away to collect firewood. We did that and it was so hard. All I wanted to do was go home maybe stare at the TV or sleep. We got our full trailer load of wood then out of the blue I stopped the car and told my wife I'll be back in 5 minutes. I jogged in one direction then returned. That was hard to do also. It's like running against the tide.
When we got home my instincts were to - yep retire inside to TV. Instead I did some digging in the garden. Then went to my 'man cave' to rearrange shelf items. This is when I have a little cry. It was getting harder. Again I went against the tide and trimmed some tree branches. I didnt even enter our home for a drink as the temptation to collapse was too great...drank from the tap.  Finally a lot of work behind me I was to enter our home then thought it best to visit our neighbour thus delaying again the resting time. Helped my neighbour with the building of his green house which took 2 hours.
A couple of days later and I'm fine. I broke that barrier. Dont know if you can try this but its worked for me. It is hard though

I've been dealing with depression for appox. 40 years. It's everpresent, smoldering, then suddenly flaring into an all consuming feeling of loss, fear, approaching doom and dreadfully explainable loneliness. It's a pit so dark and deep no light can be seen. Noone can know what it's like unless they've been there, it's the most foreign of foreign places, you can't fully explain it to someone that hasn't been there and seen the sites. But, the misery passes and medication can help, it may take some searching until you find the right doctor/s and meds, but you must keep searching. My greatest regrets bought about by my condition is the pain l've caused to people that love and care for me. I hate my own self pity, l've seen some awful things, l've been directly involved in the accidental deaths of at least two people, one of them was a small girl. I'm here whining about how miserable l feel, l can't even begin to know the misery l caused the family of these people, accidently or not. Today l was asked to recall detail some of the trauma l've witnessed and its left me feeling empty and dead inside. I know it'll pass, but while it's here the pain is almost unbearable. Writing things down or talking is cathartic, it lets some of the mental pus out of the abcess l live with. Thank you for the oppurtunity to write this here and thank you for taking the time read it. It has eased the pain and settled the flames a little in the process.

I'm supposed to be like...noticing what I feel more and like getting in touch my emotions etc. but I don't think I really feel much?
Like...I have reactions to things, e.g. we just got netflix and I was like ""yes that's awesome"" but I don't think I really felt anything physically in my body, it was just a thought? I think I used to feel more than that? Maybe? Idk?
 
And one of my grandparents who I wasn't all that close to died and I was just like ""I should act sad because that's a sad thing"", even during the funeral I was just...fine? Like I didn't care? Usually I cry pretty easily, at least in sympathy with other criers, and my mum, sister and cousins were all at least sniffling and I wasn't even doing that?
And I know when people are depressed sometimes they end up feeling numb, or they feel flat, or dead, or like they have no feelings, but I'm not all that sure what is actually meant by that? And usually I read about this being connected with losing interest in things they like which isn't what I'm experiencing... I still enjoy things, at least I think I do? Like I entertain myself, and there are still things that I like doing to fill my time.
But then life doesn't ever actually seem worth living so I guess I'm not enjoying things that much, but I've felt like that for at least two years so that's not exactly a new thing...but I'm pretty sure I used to have a lot more feelings than this. I was sad, at least, and stressed. I remember that. 
Tbh I just feel really chill...like nothing truly bothers me, like I just don't care. 
But I'm kind of confused about this whole thing and I'm not quite sure what's going on here, so I was wondering what other's people's experiences were with having less or no feelings during depression? What was this experience like? Could you still be entertained by things? Could things still make you laugh etc?
I'm not even sure what I'm really asking for here...just anything anyone can say that relates to anything I've written here lol

I have differed clinical depression for 23+ yrs and every rpisode has pushed my husband firther away.
I seem to blame him for all my failings when i get caught up in the blurred space between reality and depressed reality.
I dont know how to bridgevthe gap that just keeps getting bigger!
 He says he loves me but stands back and watches me slide further into the black hole! 
Any ideas?

Hi all, 
The old thread was getting a bit long, so I thought time to start a new. 
I thought the same with this weekend - I did my new patterns of blue and purple, wore the beautiful black and gold dress. I went to the convention I normally go to in costume. Just for one day, not in costume. It is the first time since my separation from the ex, whom I went in cosplay with. It is the first time catching up with people who I haven't seen since the break up. 
Or I thought I would.  I went and shopped a very little as I have big bills this week. I took the anti anxiety meds, tried to squash the shakes and  held up the mask for the kids. The feeling wasn't good though. I tried talking to a few friends in the costume community I bumped into but it was like they didn't even know me. They soon made excuses and left. I know its busy, they see lots of people and there are so many crowds, but it felt like they just barely recognised me, and when they did they couldn't wait to leave. 
I looked around, and it felt like I was surrounded by glass walls. Like now that everyone on my friends list knows about my depression, how bad it got, etc they don't want to know me. I asked how they were, I didn't bring it up.
I just feel dejected, and lonely, like I have no friends in the world. Like they don't care. I am irritable and not good around the kids, so I am hiding in my doona listening to a podcast. I'm really alone in this now aren't I? I say I keep going for my cats, for my little Elsa.
I hold on to the thought of watching her grow up, because  I can find no other reasons to stay.

I am in my mid 30's I have had anxiety since primary school and depression since high school, I have a husband, family and friends who love and support me but still I feel so lost and alone. I have no motivation to do anything. I sleep eat and go to work like a zombie,  my hubby has depression also so I try not to worry him with my issues. I am mostly depressed about my money situation debts bills, I hate my job,  I worry about not ever being able to have kids. Mostly I just want to feel normal and have the energy to be active and make the most of life but instead I just feel miserable 90% of the time :-(

Just joined the site so will keep it short for now. I have Major Depression and Fibromyalgia amongst other things. Right now I have that horrible feeling of alienation from the world, pain, brain fog etc. I now have a support system but it doesn't fill the blankness of the days, lack of motivation, fatigue and a feeling of pointlessly existing. Confused that I want no physical contact with people but am so isolated and alone at the same time. Not sure what I want, just know that Beyond Blue is a really good organisation. Hugs, J

I have had depression as long as I can remember. Its gotten fairly bad the last few months. I am on medication but haven't worked up the courage to see a therapist (I have many times in the past but I never connect with them)
My boyfriend who I live with has just gone to America for the month of April. It has been one weekend and I feel desperately alone. 
My co-workers tell me Ill be fine if I have my friends over all the time. Truth is I have no friends, my boyfriend is my only friend and he is gone.
To sound like a crazy cat lady, we got 2 kittens before he left as company for me. I don't know what I would do if they weren't here and it was just me..

A few years ago my mum passed away suddenly and it left me in a state of shock, anxiety and depression. For a year I was really mentally unwell, no motivation, lost my orientation, couldn't do daily tasks, numb to the world and very very sad. I then practiced meditation and mindfulness, this gave me the strength to atleast live a normal life but i still felt imbalanced, so i was medicated. It was the help i needed. I was on the medication for a year and then felt like i was ready to come off them. I was able to live off them happily. It has been a year since ive taken them or suspected i needed them. But recently I have moved away from my family and friends and don't know anyone except for my boyfriend. I have made new friends but they aren't like my ones at home. I now spend most of the day alone and find myself thinking too deeply into life, i find myself not having motivation, i find myself sometimes just wanting to cry. I called a help line because i really needed someone to talk to, i asked her if i should take my medication again and she said that its a decision i should make myself. i decided that i should, but when i tried to find them they are lost. now i have a little anxiety knowing that i dont have my medication there for the 'just incase' times. I'm not sure if i am depressed because i feel like a smoldering flame of sadness rather than the blazing fire of sadness i felt before. But i do know i don't feel happy most days. I'm not sure if its homesickness and loneliness, lack of familiarity and support or if i'm just mentally weak and can't handle life as easily as others seem to. I'm not sure what to do. i do feel like my mind isn't chemically balanced because i don't feel chemically balanced. Can anyone offer any advice? I don't have anyone to talk to about it that will understand.

Hi, i been diagnosed with depression for several years, i was on medication but came off them last year as they weren't making a difference. At the time my depression was only mild. Now its a different story i feel like ive hit rock bottom. I love my wife dearly but our marriage has been struggling over the last 6-12 months its been getting worse. I now find out she has been speaking to someone online for several months (its only that long because i guessed that long I suspect its longer). This has been very personal but she wont tell me how personal or anything and if i ask she gets angry. I was already getting worse before this and i know its my fault it happened but im really struggling every day now. I though i was a strong person but i now cry at the drop of a hat and have more dark thoughts than i would like (only thoughts). It was hard enough dealing with the depression and now this id just making it worse. I know i need help and im in the process of seeking guidance from a counselor but im at a loss. I cant stop thinking about it, i cant sleep, My mood is up and down like a yo-yo. I know she loves me but i feel im shouldering all the blame. Every time i bring it up its okay your going to see a counselor, we will get you better. Im stuck i dont know what to do and im sliding down a slippery slope.

First post.
I'm 23, female. I've had depression as long as I can remember but lately it has become almost unbearable. I have seen therapists in the past but I feel like I am not myself and just say what I think they want to hear, I struggle with face to face communication about myself.
My mind always goes back to the thought, what is the purpose of all of this? Life? The world? We live and die, we are smaller than a grain of sand to time. It will continue to go on without us, so what is the purpose to be here right now?

Hi all, I hope someone has an answer. I cry all the time and it is ruining everything for me. When ever i watch, hear or experience anything emotional, i start crying. I am a middle aged man and this is driving me nuts. I can't watch anything sad or happy on TV without starting to cry. It starts welling up and I try so hard to not cry. I make noises which scares me dog and when I am around my kids and grand kids, I make a lload sort of hissing sound when ever i get the crying urge. The kids know exactly whats going and and now ignore me.
Has anyone else experienced this?

I feel sad a lot and constantly worry about what everyone thinks of me all the time. I question myself in every aspect of my life. It doesn't matter how hard I work, how much exercise I do or how many material things I have. It doesn't matter. None of it matters. I feel like I will always have self doubt and always feel like a failure and always care about what people think of me.

I have depression, anxiety and apparently dysthymia, then after reading the information for women I display every sign of having an eating disorder, apart from actually being anorexic. I'm actually feeling quite low now. Does anyone else suffer from an eating disorder? And willing to admit it,? Huh! That's the hardest part.

Hi all, sorry for the long post but just after some advice on what I should do. I haven't been feeling too good, feels like I'm going crazy, an emotional roller coaster in my head everyday. Last year my local GP sent me to see someone after I told her I have been drinking a lot recently. The shrink pinned my condition down to anxiety. Which I think is incorrect. I have a history of minor substance abuse (marijuana 1-2 days a week & prescription pills everyday) I stopped the Marijuana 6 years ago when my son was born, but the prescription pills I kept taking up until 1 month ago.  I know what happens when you stop  your body feel like crap for a few weeks then you get better. Well my body has felt better but my mind has not. I'm an absolute wreck.    I have 2 kids and a wife which I love and I work 5 days a week 9-5.30. My work is terrible. I dread waking up and going there, I often think this is the cause of me feeling terrible. When I take a day off I feel like I'm on top of the world and I feel happy and normal again, but having a family I can not just pack up and leave my job. I need to provide for my kids. I feel trapped and stuck in this daily grind. I have worked since I was 15, I am 33 now.I have done a bit of research on what depression is and what the symptoms are and I have experienced mainly all of it, bar the suicidal thoughts and not being able to get out of bed. I love going out and doing family things but come Sunday night I become a monster again knowing I have to go back to the daily grind the next day. 2015 has been the worst year of my life so far, even though I have a loving family and get to do all the activities I love such as playing golf, fishing & go karts I still feel like crap and unhappy. We recently had family over from overseas for 3 months in 2014 I never felt this good in a long time. Going places, doing things every day but now that's over and they have left us I feel empty again.I am thinking about going back to another GP but I don't want to go talk to a shrink again and I'm afraid I will get hooked on the prescription drugs they give me. Just need some advice and thank you for reading my post.

I don't know about others but my sobriety comes hand in hand with my depression. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a miserable ex drunk blai,ing myself each day for what has been. I understand and encourage people not to wallow in the past, just to let it go. No, I think I used alcohol as a coping mechanism in a very stressful environment. Since I made the decision to put down the bottle, I've had nothing to help me cope and my depression has deepened. I was diagnosed with depression nearly 15 years ago but the doctor told me that ""as I had an addictive personality they could not give me anything for my depression"" and it took me a further 8 years to get real, solid treatment, not just dabbling round the edges. But now I am so low, so exhausted, so sore and down, I can't drag myself up. My eldest daughter loses patience with me and tells me ""she needs her mum now"" and my mother competes with me symptom for symptom. Is anyone else feeling this low or is it just me?

So i have a thousand reason to be depressed and i have a list of diagnosis. i have tried so many medications. But to add to it all i am a single parent not newly single but going on 5 years now.
i don't have some one to help with the kids. i am their all and only. I don't get to stay in bed all day, i don't get to not make dinner or wash the clothes or clean the house. i don't get to not drive the kids to school even when i am suffering the side effects of a new anti depressant. i don't get to cry all the time. i don't get to lie on the floor in the fetal position when i suffer a panic attack. i don't get time to myself.
I do get to force myself every day to get up, clean up, make meals, get the kids to school, help with homework, try to hold fake smiles and try as hard as i can not to resent my children for existing (and then hate myself for thinking that). 
Trying to find a way out of depression is hard enough. trying to do it as a single parent of three kids is well feeling impossible.
Please if you are a single parent suffering from depression say hello. i need to know I'm not alone in this struggle that there are others out there trying try find a way out of depression as a single parent.

I have been in severe emotional pain for over six months with no breaks.
Because of this my marriage, family, friendships, career - everything is threatened.
I am seeing a therapist, but it is like holding an umbrella up to a tidal wave.
Before this started, I was happier than ever. 
I know the reason for my situation, but it is something I must accept - it cannot be changed.
Looking for support here.

Hey all so this is my first post so please be patient with me.Just abit about me, I'm 24 , male , when I was 18 I was on AD's SSRI after about 8 months was okay and  was wheened off of them. I've struggled massively my whole life with anxiety, depression, fear of dying, fear that I am dying, panic attacks, self esteem and all the rest of it. My grandpa suffered with severe depression as does my dad who has been on ADs for about a year.I thought I had it down and managed after about 4 years off the meds but over the past 9 months it has crept back in and just festered and festered . I was seeing a counsellor infrequently when needed.  but now I'm seeing him 2 times a week, i honestly would not wish this on my worst enemy, i have never felt so detached, spacey, low, sensetive , emotional or anxious in my life . I woke up and I was angry that I woke up. After fighting this so vigorously for so long I feel like it's beaten me and I don't know how to be apart of this world or if I'll ever feel okay again, or happy. I eat really healthy, excersise everyday ( which now I've lost the drive to do and it's become a chore), I try be social as much as I can but have withdrawn a lot, I get 30 minutes of sun every day, I dance part time as an outlet, see a counsellor, told my family, see a doctor , moving out with a friend so I'm not alone, hang out with pets and animals , relaxing music and yoga when I can .. I'm really proactive about beating this but am losing hope fast. It got so bad that now I've lost my jobs . 9 days ago I  started taking a relatively low does of AD that works on melatonin . But since taking it feel foggy and spacey like in a dream state, it makes me a little disorientated , I've got terrible sleep and feel like my anxiety is a lot worse which is making me more depressed. I know I'm ment to give it 2+ weeks to feel better but I can't help but doubt this pill as it seems to be making me feel worse. In all fairness the thoughts of lack of purpose and meaning have decreased slightly ?  My point is I feel like I'm doing everything someone who hopes to be happy should be doing and I'm not happy. Which leaves me asking will I ever be? What next ? I feel like I'm watching a video game of my life and not actually apart of it. I feel like I am dying .  Any techniques, groups, advice , similar experience would be greatly appreiciated as I'm just at a loss now.

Hello.Im 25yrs old and seemed to have my life together about a year ago. However things crumbled slowly.  My mum took a bad turn and attempted suicide.  She has been suffering from depression and anxiety for years and lately its been at its worse. Sometimes She wont leave the house and lays around being depressed.  It affects because i have to live with it.  Last year i left my job of five years and since then i still havnt found a suitable job or even know what i want to do. I feel like i am now becoming depressed because i cant find a job.  I keep putting guilt on myself for not having a new job.  Should i really be like this? beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all
Finding myself feeling really low today. It's been cold and wet today and getting dark earlier and I just seem to get depressed as a result. 
Then when I'm in this ""funk"" I start to obsess over things I've done in the past and things that have happened and feel intense guilt and regret. I'm also not very well physically and struggling to see a light at the end of the tunnel or imagine a day when I'll feel better.
 Anyone else experience the same feelings, particularly in winter? What do you do to cope?

Hi there, I'm new to the forums.  I have been battling depression for the past few months after a health scare.  Now I'm finding that a lot of issues from my past have cropped up and I'm having to deal with my grief from a broken marriage 10 years ago.  This is really hard for my as I've lived alone quite successfully for the past 10 years.  I am getting professional help etc, but some days it's really hard going.  I have a good family and good friends who support me, but at times I feel totally alone in this.  My greatest thing is battling my stomach depression which wakes me up in the morning, it's like a gigantic knot in my stomach.  I do breathing exercises and try to relax, but the only real way of releasing the knot is to cry, and then that can last for quite a while.  Now to top it off, I,m having songs and music stuck in my head.  Am I going crazy?????  Any suggestions would be great.  I'm 65 years old and didn't think I'd have to walk this road again.

I've been...feeling quite low these past couple of weeks. Upon the suggestion of my psych I've tried to isolate what I feel and what I've come up with is what I'm writing here. Problem is that often I can't understand why I feel this way. Anyway...
I realised that I feel like I'm being phased out of my own life; that I'm becoming irrelevant.  Between not feeling comfortable at all around my family and feeling like a low priority to my friends, I feel like with everything that I've built up for myself in this life can get along without me now. And life seems to just be erasing me. And on some level, I think I'm letting it.
i had to get that thought out across to someone.

Hi everyone,
I'm looking for some clarification or explanation for my behaviour/feelings. I'm not sure whether I would be classified depressed and/or anxious. I am a uni student in my last year of study currently on placement. (Perhaps ironically) My degree is in welfare and I am really interested in exploring mental health and disability avenues for employment. My mother had depression when I was around 10 and recovered, although not without the help of antidepressants which she used for several years.
My situation involves me being very stressed because of a lack of time, motivation and energy. Placement is very fast-paced, and very challenging. I am doing a job that I can sometimes feel overwhelmed by for a number of reasons. 1, the work is challenging and I am still learning. 2, all the things I do have fast deadlines, which can be stressful, especially because those deadlines are my supervisor's deadlines, not mine. That gives me a feeling of guilt when I am not working as fast as I need to be. 3, the job requires me to wake up early (5:15am, 2 days a week) and coupled with my paid job (bartending day and night shifts, 3-4 times per week) I can be very tired. This combination of factors can lead me to be anxious some mornings, with one instance leading me to call in sick one day to placement.
I have also got feelings of being flat, miserable, irritable, sad, exhaustion and episodes of crying without any provocation. I have had instances where I would tear up randomly and I would have to fight off a fit of crying. I have had instances where I've just thought everything is just too hard. Please let me stress that I don't mean this in regard to life itself. I do not have suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming myself or others. I have called in sick to my paid work more than once because I just couldn't see myself turning up to work and forcing myself to smile for the patrons and other staff. 
I have told my partner about these feelings as we live together and I know it's not healthy to try to keep feelings like this to myself. However, I don't think he completely understands the gravity of what I'm saying, or maybe he doesn't know what to do. The bottom line is I haven't seen a professional yet as I'm not sure if I would be classed as anxious and/or depressed and I'm not too keen to speak to a stranger about something so personal. Also, I don't want to speak to my family as I don't want them to worry (yet), especially given the family history.

hey. So I post here now and again and read people's stories. I have a wife and I don't like sharing things. Like depression and bad stuff that used to happen to me. So I talk to people online about it and it makes me feel better. The problem is she's insecure. So when I talk to people about it I do it discretely. I don't want to bring it up with her and I don't want her to know about my old life. I tell people I can't remember anything from before I was 16. Anyhow she caught me taking to someone and immediately went ballistic. She doesn't like me talking to people online. up till 2 am getting blasted Because I won't share anything with her or take about it.  The thing is I don't want to talk about it. I just want anon people to listen and not judge so I can keep living normally. I don't want anything in my past to get dragged up ever. And I don't want to share. 
 
I guess I'm just venting but how do you convey to someone there's a part of you they will never know and you'll never share it with them. Without them feeling rejected. Especially when shes your wife. 
 
How do you explain to them how depressed you get and it's natural. They've had a perfect life. No medical issues. No abuse. No trauma. Like someone with PTSD I get angry at her when she wants to talk and I really don't want to. How would a soldier talking about what he did in the war and the things he's seen and had done to him help... it wouldn't. I just don't know what to do. I feel like I want to be normal but I'm being forced. It doesn't help that she's insecure and thinks I cheat on her even though I tell her I don't I just talk to people. 
 
And I don't want to tell her about how I talk to people and talk on forums because I don't want her reading the things I type mainly to protect her from myself Because I'm afraid she might leave me if she found out. I feel so ashamed I can't just be normal.

Today after another day of being in the pit I decided to try and cheer myself up with a lollie at home. As I ate it, the wrapper asked: ""What's your favourite thing about a person in this room?""
As I sat there in a room on my own, I could think of nothing I liked, let alone my favourite thing.
Today I realised I need to get serious about help.

Does anyone else struggle physically each day? I feel like to just get up and move, putting one foot in front of the other, even drawing breath a real struggle. I've worked one way or another since I was 6 years old, but now if I had to ""go to work"" I doubt I coukd even make it to the car without collapsing. Every little thing, even taking a shower, seems to take so much energy I just can't do it. Does anyone else have this?

Ever since I was a child I was told "" you eldest sister had the brains, your next sister is beautiful, but never mind you're the funny one"".  A tag which has annoyed me all my life as I'm not a blasted clown. Since my depressions got worse and I've slowed down physically and mentally, I'm getting reminded of this even more, especially when I cant be all bright and happy. Even right now, after telling family I am fine, not cross, I've just been told ""I don't care what you say, something's making you cross right now because you are not all happy and smiling""  which means either I've got to pretend to be happy or I'll end up in a fight in about 3 hours or so. I can't handle a fight so I'll slap on a smile and then everyone else will feel ok while I'm crying inside. Why can't I just be how I feel? Why are their feelings more important than mine?

I have been on and off many different anti depressants for nearly 20 years . First diagnosed as post natal after my mum died in awful circumstances during the pregnancy of my first child. I have always thought of myself as resilient and determined despite a very difficult child hood and have succeed career wise . I have a great husband and wonderful healthy kids. I don't like relying on meds because of hang up over my mum's addictive behaviors ( which killed her) but every few years it seems to come back. A horrible depressive episode. It seems I  can be that adventurous, positive , spontaneous Mum. Wife and colleague. I can take on projects and succeed at high levels in the workplace with loads of energy and then I can be back here, a horrible person, irritable, angry, full of self loathing  and despair after my despicable outbursts.  I just ride the the ups and downs and apologies a lot to my family when I know I have been unreasonable. (God knows how I control it in the workplace but I seem better at controlling outbursts there)This time it has got so bad my husband said he has had enough, he has since said he doesn't mean it ,but I don't blame him. tI haven't been able to go to work or do anything for a week. Tomorrow I am likely to be admitted  to hospital. I told them I want to go because I can't cope anymore and I don't want to do this to my family. I don't want my kids seeing me like this. 
I am hoping someone is going to tell me that going to hospital is a good decision. I will do all the therapy courses an someone will assess me and give the right medication and I will come out and it will be all good again.  A few people,have told me it could be really traumatic and I should try to heal myself at home.

Hi everyone. This is the first time I have ever opened up about myself. I've tried to do so in the past with friends and family but it makes them uncomfortable.
 
I am really struggling with everything at the moment.
 I have no career prospects, I've lost job after job. I cannot feel anything any more. Is this normal? I have been so tired and weary - I don't know what to do. I've never asked for help before.

I have been told I had depression before, over 5 years ago. I never felt like it really went away.Tonight I feel like I have 'cracked'i feel like I am on the verge of crying all the time. My arms feel heavy. Breathing hurts. I want to tear all my hair out. Am I crazy? Have I lost it? I feel like a failure. I will never amount to anything. Everything I try I fail at. I have no direction in my life and it's terrifying. I don't know what I want, or where I want to go, so I have no direction I feel like a failure. I called my mother to talk it through and everything she said is true, I am capable of success. I guess my failure is my own fault, it my doing, I am the only one to blame. How can I stop feeling like this, it's so heavy it's crushing me. I can't see the end. I can't see the point of going on. Please, I just want to hear your stories of what you have done to give me hope. Thanksbeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi thereI'm new.  I posted 2 posts here last week but they were removed by BB - my word count was too long.  So I'm starting again   Thanks to the two people who replied to me I appreciate your support but can't remember your names sorry.  One of you said I haven't gained control of my thoughts and I'm wondering if you can clarify how I can do that please? as its a skill I definitely need to learn. I'm a 58 yr old female & very frustrated that at my age I still haven't got my crap together!!!!  I've suffered from anxiety & depression all my life but only 15 yrs ago diagnosed & treated with meds and psychology.  18 months ago after a prolonged period of stress and mental struggles, I slipped into severe chronic depression and anxiety and had to give up work.  I had no motivation for anything, didn't want to get out of bed and felt anxious about everything. I couldn't see any point in life. Nothing (even my lovely friends and pets) seemed worth living for. I had no appetite and diarrhoea. It's a very scary way to feel as I'm sure you're all aware. I've felt that way before but it's never lasted more than a few weeks. I find it so scary that it has lasted so long and hence my fear that I'll never get better this time.I live on my own & have no family but have several good friends. With the support of 2 wonderful friends I survived the last 18 months, and 3 months ago took up part time work which is going ok tho most days I'm forcing myself to go so I'm not actually enjoying it yet.  But I know it's good for me to have the income & social interaction.  Although I've improved and I now have good days where I feel like my old self (that's such a wonderful feeling!!).  I can't seem to hold onto it no matter how I try and, after a few days I slip back into the deep black hole again.  I'm trying really hard to be well - forcie myself to push through feelings to socialise & achieve things, to eat  & exercise.  Do other self help stuff such as take Tumeric, omega 3's, drink water, monitor thoughts.  I hate my life. It's really getting me down and I'm afraid im never going to get better no matter how hard I try.  My psychiatrist says coming out of it is an up and down process not a smooth path so that helps explain it a bit.  I just hate that gloomy/anxious feeling that is always in the background waiting to smother me. I feel It's my fault  I must be doing something wrong.Have you been through similar and recovered?  PLEASE tell me how you did it.

Hi all just want to tell my story, I've had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was a painfully shy and self conscious child and teenager, I had very few friends and found it very hard to relate to girls. I met my now ex husband when I was 18 and moved in with him after 2 weeks together. We had 3 children and we're together for 16 years before he left. Although we were both unhappy, him leaving absolutely devastated me, I'd lost my family.  
I was diagnosed with PND in 2006 after my 2nd child was born, and have been on AD ever since. Since the breakup I slipped into a deep depression and life has been a constant battle ever since. I've let myself go, put on 20kgs and generally hate myself. When I'm having a really down episode, I won't leave the house, I feel very anxious, I sleep a lot, and just lock myself away from the world. 
I have 3 healthy, beautiful and happy kids, but I'm scared I have damaged them as they saw me hit rock bottom. The only reason I'm still walking this earth is because of them. 
I know I need to exercise to be healthier mentally and physically, but the thought of going to a gym or walking the streets makes me so anxious, 
I'm so grateful to have a roof over my head, food on the table and healthy kids, but the constant struggles in my head make it hard to be happy.
Anyway enough of my whinging, have a great day. 😘

Hi everyone,
I'm wondering if anyone else feels scared to seek help about their depression? I've been feeling pretty awful for a while now and some days I'm sure I am getting worse. I know the go to advise is to seek help from a GP but I'm scared to go because I'm scared of what they will say.
I guess the problem is that I'm worried they will diagnose me with depression, because once I'm diagnosed it will be a real thing and I have to handle it, it's not just my secret that I can hide away until I'm alone in my room or crying in the shower, and then pretend isn't happening tomorrow when the sun comes up. I'm so worried about what might happen if  GP decides I have depression; I don't what to be medicated and even though I am dying to talk to someone about what is going on in my head, no amount of talking is going to fix all the things I'm sad about. 
And then there's the flip side of it. Maybe I won't be diagnosed with anything, and if I don't have anything then why am I the way I am? Some days I'm losing my mind and I'm certain there's something wrong with me, and other days I feel less crazy and I wonder if I'm just hormonal or tired and too lazy to deal with my problems. And then I feel guilty for thinking that way, and I feel guilty writing it now, because it's like I'm hoping I have a mental illness.. and that's not right, is it?
I guess what I'm saying is I'm scared to have it confirmed either way. But I'm also scared of where I might end up if I don't get help. I don't know what to do! 
 I'm really wanting to know if anyone can relate to how I feel and if so, what did you do/are you doing?

This week hasn't been too bad until today. Have been busy, my coping strategy. Friday spent most the day socialising, the depression/anxiety etc. sitting on my shoulder but I managed. Yesterday I spent all day doing craft and was pleased with the results.
Today I was flat out getting up, felt tired, sleepy and flat as a tack. I went to a friends for lunch managing to keep it together and hiding how l was feeling. Now my stomach is in knots, feel teary and so down.
Feel like a freak, can't hold it together. I just want to feel normal and don't ask me what normal is, l don't know any more.
My depression etc. seems like it will never go away. I am in therapy but my hope of ever feeling better is almost nonexistent.
Others get better. I'm the freak that doesn't.
 I want someone to tell me it will all go away but that will never happen.
sorry guys l'm just over it all.

Hi. I am a 30 year old male who has for a long period of time suffered severely with depression, and until only very recently realised I have possibly been more so affected by anxiety. Things have been coming to a head for a while and exploded a couple of weeks ago when I attempted suicide.At the time I felt I had nothing, I had moved to follow my partner of 3 months to a new town, and basically dropped my entire life to start a new one. My decision. Nobody elses. Things had began going wrong from the time I moved, I had contact with my own children stopped by their mother, I have struggled to settle in my new home, didnt like the job I had and the bliss of the new love began to fade mainly I would suggest amongst my failing happiness. A heated argument and talk of a split left me feeling I had nothing left....hopeless and a fool. Foolishly I attempted to end it all. Thankfully I was found and I have recovered well after a few days in ICU. I know what I did was wrong. I know it isnt the answer. I know what I need to do to mke sure I never end up in that situation again. I am taking all the appropriate steps. My main issue is that my partner is struggling with what has happened and is pushing me away. Initially she was very supportive and I am forever grateful and thankful.....I realise how cruel and horrible it must have been for her to go through....she seen me in a bad way. Problem is that now she says she doesnt trust me, has no idea who I am and doesnt want this for her life. I love her and feel we are meant to be. Can I support what she needs to be feeling or is this a case of me needing to pull away myself to protect my own mind and safety.......I am struggling with being shunned and hate the idea I have someone who is perhaps only with me because they are afraid I will hurt myself. I dont know what to do...can someone please give me some insight....i fear this will push me back into my mind.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I am retired and comfortable with a good Wife, we have been married for over 40 years. I had heart surgery in 2006 and last year I had a ICD implanted.
I feel useless and cannot get on top of living with this condition. I know all the things that I am lucky to be alive etc. etc. doesn't help.
I wake in the morning just black and that can last some time, it also can hit me for no reason and for no reason and make my life pointless. There are times that I am hit with just anger for no reason, not anger that I would hurt anyone just anger at life.

Hi guys. This is my first time here- I'm not sure what I am hoping to find here, but thought I would give it a go.I have battled with depression since my teens and more prevalently post natally and beyond. I am on anti-depressants and, try to meditate regularly, have seen a psych on and off - but mainly try to navigate it all myself. Recently I am just exhausted of my motivation, drive and will. I just want to sleep. Basic tasks are almost impossible. The energy it takes to put on a strong and happy facade at work and around friends and family is wearing thin. I just want to hibernate. I don't want to do anything. Not a thing. Ive been here before, but struggle to see how to pull myself out, what to allow myself and where to push myself? It is overwhelming. No amount of positive thinking or effort helps now.... It is all consuming. I feel it in my stomach, in my chest, in my heart and in my head. It isn't fair. I don't want to share this with friends, my husband knows but there is only so much I want to unload on him...... I feel like there is no one to talk to..... So I suppose that's why I'm here. Mi am very used to this just being a part of who I am.... But sometimes it's just too much. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Why is it that whenever I say something, whether written or spoke, and I don't get the exact response that I expected (or wanted?) I have this feeling of having offended that person, or that I have said something totally idiotic?  Has this to do with my mental illness or is it something else altogether?  Any thoughts from anyone?

Hi, I'm a young academic who is trying to fight depression on my own. I've fought this before in high school and never thought it would come back for another tournament. I know the signs and they scare me. I'm too ashamed to tell my fiance. My work is slowly crushing me and I am continually thinking that I've made my parter sad or mad when I haven't and he isn't. I go from super excited to downright miserable all in a day. It's a cycle I don't know how to get out from. I don't have many friends where I live and none I can really talk to. I hope by posting here there might be someone who's in the same situation as me or has been and could give me some insight into how to Start climbing back out of the ring.

Hi Everyone,
This is my first post and I am doing this as a way of helping myself out of this depressive state of being.  I am so very tired and feel like I just want to stay in my bedroom and sleep however I am a sole parent to 3 wonderful children (22months, 11yrs and 16yrs) and I must function not only to meet my responsibilities but because I love my children and want to be the best that I can be for them and myself.  I have isolated myself socially for a very long time.  I realise I need to makes steps to remedy this and recently started going to AA meetings however I find them overwhelming on every level. I have been sober for 1 month and 17 days and I am grateful AA and intend to keep going however I haven't been for 3 weeks now and am trying to work up the courage to go back.  I have always used alcohol and pot to deal with depression since I was a teenager and it has only ever made things worse so I am determined to walk down a new path from now on. I thought that by talking to people online it may be a start to finding my way back from the isolation I have dealt myself over the years and might lead me to build up the courage to reach out to people in the real world.  I'm not going to hide who I am anymore, I have to be honest with myself and others so I can move forward. Does anyone have any advice about how to form new connections with people after actively avoiding connections for so long?

I have a great team of help who look after me. I have a case manager and a peer support worker, I am currently waiting for a new psychologist but that may come when the dbt group starts I am not sure on that one.
I still feel iI am getting nowhere even with all this support I am also on medication. I feel all I have learnt is what I can and can not say due to there requirements. I feel I can not be honest about my latest plan, but yet I am still trying to get all this help. I am loosing hope and fast I want to see that this is worth all my time and energy I put in but it feels like it's all been worth nothing I just need some hope but I have lost all mine.......

I have suffered depression for many years (8yrs). I have been to the lowest point you can go and have come back from it. I view my illness now as the equivalent of diabetes  there is no cure, but I have learned to live and manage it.  It does not rule me  I rule it.  The thoughts are just that.  It had taken me many year and countless hours of treatment and a few hospital admission to come to this conclusion, finally I have.  There is hope and light at the end of the tunnel.  I hope someone reads this that has no hope, but believe me there is.  I tried to harm myself  thank god I did not take. I am now working On myself every day and believe there is a better world out there. My goal in life now is to help people in need and to explains experience.  Life is worth living and enjoying

Dear all,
I've recently been having experiences which are (not ironically) increasing my anxiety that I might be approaching a breakdown. A week or so ago I had my mental healthcare plan renewed at my GP. We didn't really discuss much that might have been obvious triggers, but afterwards, when I got into my car I just started crying and struggled to stop.

I've been googling for information but can't really find any that isn't vague. Perhaps that's just the way this sort of thing goes, but I'm really trying to understand what the warning signs of a breakdown are, and what the symptoms are, because knowing - I guess - is half the battle.

Cheers

Hi, this is my first post here. It is 3 am,  & I can't sleep.Life is pretty darn hard at the moment.I am on the recovery side of extreme workplace bullying. An entire team of managers at work were bullied to breaking point. Following a period of investigation that lasted 5 months, the CEO (bully) was given the opportunity to resign- which she did. She left a parting shot email telling me I cry too much, & people don't respect me as a nurse.Through this process I have developed depression and anxiety. I have severe insommnia. I fall asleep ok, but as soon as i wake up i have work shit and rambling thoughts going on. I have gained 15 kg in a year, & lived on 2 minute noodles and popcorn. I thought once the bully was gone things would improve - & they have, but not to the extent I had hoped.Each time I experience a stressor, I have these horrific visualisations. They can be relatively minor stresses that trigger these thoughts, and can happen anywhere - work, supermarket, while I'm on a walk. This started during the bullying process, but hasn't gone away.I live in a very isolated rural town. Bully lives here still- she moved house and now lives around the corner from me. She drives a very distinctive car, if i see it on the street, i feel very overwhelmed. Recently i was in New Zealand & saw the same make and model car. I freaked out, & had to do some serious self talk to calm down.There is not much opportunity for good mental health support here.My partner says she understands,  but when she asks how I'm feeling, & I am honest with her she tells me to stop talking - I know this is because it upsets her.I can't seem to make decisions, relationship is suffering greatly, sex is non existent,  everything is just too hard. Sometimes I sit in my car and wonder if I would have the courage to just drive & keep going. I don't know where I would go, or how I would survive, & that unknown is probably the only thing that keeps me from going.I got back to work yesterday after holidays, & the first conversation I had with the acting CEO essentially centred around how much better things had been while I was away. I am being performance managed now because of that. I am at a total loss on what to do to keep going.I have a friend who tells me I need to sit in this pain and reflect on it to understand. The thought of doing that makes me physically sick - I don't think I can bear the rawness of itbeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I am 23 yrs old, so have a life ahead of me and wonder if any of you ladies have found a partner who genuinely cares for you and accepts your depression as something that is not your fault and that you need occasional empathy and special care for?
   While I have been very reluctant to define depression as 'a part of who I am' during the nearly 1 yr in which I've been seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis, a recent panic attack and sadness about memories from my childhood when I thought I was truly 'over depression' and moving forward with my life has made me think that maybe depression will be a theme in the rest of my life.I was previously in a 3 yr relationship with a man who I thought loved me but turned out to have lied to me since the beginning and called me 'crazy' for exhibiting behavior that he thought was strange when I was going through a lot of sadness about remembering painful memories and wonder if any man will accept me and the sadness I have about my past.

I don't know where to start, I don't know if I even suffer from depression or am just a little lost in life.I'm Stinson, I'm a 23 year old Caucasian male. I haven't had the best luck with employment, everytime I get a break get a job, it falls apart as soon as I get ahead, and I end up back to square one. It's like I can't move forward. I've been going through this for 4 years, and it's stressful.my relationship history is the only thing more sketchy than my working history, I've had 2 long term relationships, 1 mid term passionate, romantic relationship and then the spark of a pre relationship recently. All of which were unsuccessful and just end in me being hurt more than they are. so I'm sort of in a point in life where I don't know what to do, I think it would be easier to not wake up most mornings, and I think about dieing more often than not. I'm not capable of suicide, I couldn't do it, it scares me too much, but I do think it would be easier if I just stopped waking up one morning. so this is where I'm at, I don't know what's wrong with me, I just thought I'd reach out, because I'm at a point that I need someone but have no one. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Ok So I cant mention self harm but would like to say it does go hand in hand with certain forms of depression. This can mean putting yourself in dangerous situations, physically hurting yourself, abusing drugs, becoming reclusive, associating with the 'Wrong type' of people.
I have done them all but would like to hear from anyone who has had success in suppressing these urges. Strategies, own stories, Anything even a good recipe for scones. The only tricks I have learned so far are laughing at 'It' or compartmentalising it....

Hey everyone. A bit of background on me: had first ever appointment with psychiatrist in January, he said I have mild BPD and also prescribed me medication for depressive feelings. He also referred me to a psychologist. Had a few appointments with psychologist, found he wasn't going in a direction I felt I needed to go in (focusing entirely on phobias and social anxiety which aren't the problems I came to get help for) so I have stopped going. Was feeling good on medication, was as upbeat as I can be and had no suicidal ideations. During this time I had no job and was running out of money so that's a time that would normally trigger bad thoughts, and I weathered it, remarkably. Due to having no money I couldn't afford to get my script  filled and haven't been taking it for over a week. I started a full time job nearly 3 weeks ago, got a car and have started learning to drive, and am moving to a nicer house this month, where I can fulfil my dream of getting a dog. Yet the creeping thoughts of loneliness, helplessness, sadness, despair, uselessness and thoughts of suicide have crept back in and tonight I have been crying in the bathroom alone and picturing a world without me. I feel so lonely and isolated from my family (they live an hour away) and down and out. This is exactly how I have felt for a long time and why I sought help. So I am beginning to realise, that even though things are, on paper, 'looking up' for me, that I can never be happy. My own brain will not allow me to be happy. This adds to my sadness and despair and wondering what is the point. I need to get my script again, and I see that maybe I can never live a life without some type of anti depressant. Even though I don't have major depression, a persistent low mood and patches of feeling worthless and suicidal is a big deal to live with. Is a life on anti-depressants a life? I feel like I have been burdened with this brain and I'm so lonely, yet know that being near people won't cure that loneliness. It's a bad thing. Anyway this is a huge rant, I guess I want to hear from people that it IS possible to have 'a life' when your own brain is working against your happiness. Thanks and sorry for the rant.

Feeling extremely low today, thank goodness I am off to see my shrink this afternoon.
Have been going along feeling not great but managing to get through the day. My resting rate as my shrink calls it. 
Yesterday I could feel myself going down and this morning I woke up feeling really low.  Yes I suffer from depression/anxiety/ptsd/gad but with the help of my shrink and a psychologist I am presently seeing on the mental health scheme, I get by.  
Today is a shocker, feel like a heavy weight is squashing me and I don't know why.  Nothing unusual has happened that I can think of.  Saw my mum last weekend and I feel she is a bit more frail but I was aware of that.
Don't know what is going on, don't like it, was feeling a slight glimmer of hope that one day I would feel better but today that has gone.
Life shouldn't feel so hopeless.

Please note I have not been formally diagnosed with any mental Illness, this post is to determine whether I should seek professional help. In the past five weeks I have been experiencing some out of character behaviours that I believe may be the start of a mild depression. These are as follows: Completely random feelings of sadness that often lead me to cry, sometimes up to six times a day with no apprant reason. Insomnia, previously I would sleep like a log, now I spend sometimes up to three hours a night trying to get to sleep, which has been ongoing for the entire five weeks. I'm finding myself having these little 'episodes' where I break down and cry at almost anytime e.g. driving in the car,often I can feel a little worthless or hopeless and while I have had some of these little breakdowns in front of my boyfriend I find that they mostly affect me when I am alone and that I have more intense one's when I am by myself. I've never once thought about self harm, or suicide and I have always considered myself quite a strong person mentally. I just seem to be having these little epsiodes of intense crying and sadness that I really cannot explain, and of course the Insonmia Is starting to really affect me. Do you think my concerns are valid? Did you ever experience anything like this? And what did you do?

I have been fighting depression for a while now but lately I have been getting what I refer to as the really dark moods. They are something beyond the sadness or numbness that I usually get. I just feel like curling into a ball and crying at first and then I get irrationally angry. I feel like falling to my knees, holding my hands over my ears and screaming for the world to just shut up. I don't know what or who I want to shut up, that's just what I feel like screaming. They really scare me. They seem to happen randomly and can be triggered by the most insignificant reason. For example, today one of my really dark moods got triggered by getting frustrated by traffic. They always happen in the late afternoon or at night. 
Has anyone else felt like this? How do you deal with them? I really struggle with them and can be stuck in one of these moods for many hours at a time. They only seem to go away with sleep but it always leaves me feeling extremely drained afterwards.

Hi,
I've suffered from both generalised anxiety and depression for a number of years.  At present I feel I'm slipping into depression again, feeling disconnected and sad.  One of my on going challenges is to remember the good stuff.  When I think back in time, it's the negative experiences that I remember most, and I find myself beating myself up over stuff that happened long ago. Anyone else out there experiencing something similar?  What do you find helpful? I've read about mindfulness but I find it quite difficult to put into practice.

I don't know what's wrong with me. A couple of years , even when I was in an abusive relationship, I was still interested in lots of things and being involved with activities and people. But now I feel like an empty husk. The only things I feel I can manage to do is blog on tumblr; even on there I find it difficult to be involved with people and interests. I have a lovely new partner, but I feel like I don't bring anything to the table, that I'm there like a doll. I have no urge to do anything productive, I have no skills, I can't commit to interests anymore. I feel like I exist as some kind of doll, I'm not actually living a life. I despise my past, especially because I feel that my ex ruined me psychologically, I don't like the person I am now and I have no motivation to become better, and the future I want seems like a big joke because I won't achieve it.

For years I have had depression, I am better now then in the last twenty years having taken control over some aspects of my life such as work and how I live.  For years I worked hard and gave much and only others benefited.  I am 45 now, I have little, I left my marriage with nothing and was in an accident that left me in debt, I have no savings but if I keep going I will be able to clear my debts by the end of next year and be able to save to have my own home.  I worry that it's too late in life for me to be able to save and pay off a home and I'll always have to just rent someone elses but I can only try, atleast either way I can afford my lifestyle, to keep a roof over my head and take care of my pets.
I went on a few dates after my marriage but the last ended after three months when he asked if I would support him so that he didn't have to go to work anymore.  After that I dismissed the idea of subjecting myself to any form of relationship, I have been on my own for two years, I have no family and my only human interaction is with work colleagues, I spend weekends alone with my pets for company and feel happy with this, I only occasionally think it may be nice to have someone to converse with or do activities with or hug.  I tried to join a bike club but found I actually prefer cycling alone, I joined the dog club and having a common interest through the dogs helps interacting with the people.
I feel safer, more comfortable and less stressed living alone then I ever did living with someone else.  I don't feel judged, put down or hurt, I only occasionally feel lonely, bored or afraid.  I feel good about myself when I achieve things and in my ability to manage my own affairs without a need to rely on anyone else.
Sometimes I try to imagine in another relationship or even just giving one a go but I dismiss the idea because I can't trust my ability to judge a good person from a bad one and am too afraid.  I think some people in life become so broken that they lose the ability to try again, people may say that I am cutting myself off from things that may turn out to be wonderful but I am also protecting myself from any further loss and pain.  I have an inability to try to trust any longer.  I have a tattoo which reads Trust No1 which can be read to mean either Trust Noone or Trust Number One and I do trust noone not even myself as I have made too many errors of judgement in the past.
Is it wrong to not trust ever again, why does it matter if I don't?

I'm sitting on the couch at midnight, sobbing. Why does this hit with no warning? My daughter is home from boarding school, my family are all well, safe. There is no reason to feel this way. It is so frustrating! This year I have had to resign from work due to anxiety and depression. For several weeks now it has felt like a huge weight has been lifted, and I was actually happy. Then tonight it feels like I am suffocating and I don't know why. I have read a lot of others' thoughts, things to try, but I just can't bring myself to do anything. I also feel ridiculous writing this, looking for what? I'm not sure, just a need to know that it affects others in the same way I suppose, that I'm not going crazy. I'm sitting here hoping my husband doesn't wake up because he won't know what to do or say, how to make it better, and then he will feel bad too.

About 4 months ago, I was let go from my job and my mental health began to spiral. I sat through a mental health assessment with my GP and was told I scored extremely high with depression and anxiety. I suspect that I have had depression on varying scales since I was a teenager but have always struggled to open myself up to others for fear of humiliation or judgement so I always swept it under the rug. 
Since losing my job, I have been having increasingly negative thought patterns, mostly feelings of extreme guilt that I am  letting others in my life down because of how I am acting and feeling or worse, I will make assumptions of what those people may be thinking about me and those assumptions turn to fact in my head. This in turn has made me feel the need to withdraw from my family and friends. I have been struggling to find a counsellor who I am comfortable talking to, but also who operates outside normal business hours (as to not conflict with my new job), and is bulk billed as my husband and I are experiencing hardship. 
 I had an extremely bad day a few weeks ago where I just felt that there was no hope of receiving any kind of help, and unfortunately had a family get together later that night where I reacted irrationally to a comment someone made which left me in an anxiety attack and unable to stop myself crying for hours. My husband took me home and I told my mum and brother that I would open up to them about it when I was ready. I still don't feel as though I am ready to talk to them, but if I have learnt anything from other people's experiences, it is that having a support network is one of the best things you can do. My issue is that I don't know how to begin talking, or what sort of reaction I will get. I have this overwhelming fear that if people know the thoughts that I am having, they won't want to know me and I'm not sure how to push past it. 
Any advice would be amazing.

Hi everyone. I am relatively new to the forums. Have found it helpful so far (thanks all for your support to those that have written to me). Just need to vent really about my situation at the moment as I am worrying a lot..
I am a 30 year old married guy with a young son (he will be 3 in May) and my wife is 35 weeks pregnant and will be having our second child in the next few weeks. She is most likely going to have to have a Caesar too so will be needing even more support from me. I work full time doing shift work at all weird and wonderful hours but will get a few weeks off when the baby comes. 
I have only been on antidepressants about 6 months but have probably been depressed for a few years. Was in denial for a long time. My wife reckons I haven't been the same man since our son was born in 2012 and I tend to agree. As much as I adore and love my son to bits, I have struggled with fatherhood and the way it has changed my life (and our relationship) forever. 
I feel like I have no time at all for me anymore and am really worried this will get even worse when the baby comes. I am excited about the birth but also really scared! Saw my doctor recently and she thinks I should stay on the tablets for now and thinks I am going to need them for a while.
Have recently been trying to increase the amount of physical activity I am doing with some success but can't see it lasting once baby arrives. There just isn't going to be anytime.. I am sure anyone with young kids or kids in general can relate?? Or am I wrong? 
Finding it very difficult to relax and wind down after work. I come home and it is straight into playing cars, toilet training, cleaning up endless mess and trying to maintain a house, garden and pay bills etc. I know I sound like a real whinger and this is just everyday life, but how am I going to cope with a new born baby on top of all of this too? And try and manage my moods and find time for me. It is going to be a real struggle. Feel sick just thinking about it to be honest.

I hate
hearing the term, “you have all the strategies, the rest is up to you”. It
genuinely feels like a sinking anchor in my gut. Very rarely do I actually
reach out for help, and when I do it is such an incredibly difficult thing to
do. I want to be like everyone else must be. I want to light a candle and feel
relaxed. I want to meditate and feel at peace. I want to get so lost in the
movie that I put on, that I forget why I needed to watch it in the first place.
In times like these, I wonder why I can’t be like those people. I know everyone
is different, but I can run through my entire list and still come up empty.
This whole idea of just sitting with how I feel, that never feels okay with me.
If something isn’t right, I want to fix it, you know?? Often times, after
attempting to gain support or advice from other professionals, I’m left with
empty hands. It just reinforces my worst fear – that I’m too different. I’m too
difficult, I’m too messed up.
Do you ever
experience this?? How do you pull yourself out of slumps when it feels like everything you
have tried has failed, and everyone else is stumped too??

I've always been introverted and enjoy the company of animals over people, I tend to be anti-social, finding excuses to not participate in social events although most people think I am some sort of social butterfly. I have a tendency to be pessimistic yet for some reason people tend to come to me for support for their problems (which I like). I find it easy to be positive for everyone else but myself. I have been this type of supportive person since I was young - initially for Mum and my older brother who needed help due to issues in our own home (i.e domestic violence, emotional abuse, etc)... so I have grown up as someone who is a strong support for others, who never allowed my own vulnerability to show. I was the one who did well with sport and academics, who enjoyed learning and was assumed to be destined for success, etc so even I thought I was a strong person who didn't ""need help"".The reality is that, I have a lot of self doubt, and I have been a miserable person and have had dark thoughts from a very young age. To be honest I am surprised that I have made it as long as 27. I am insecure most of the time, especially in relationships - and lately more than ever in my marriage. I feel that I have managed my sadness by having at least one good thing... friends/Mum/studies/sport/work etc... not always all at the same time. It is my birthday in a couple of days and upon reflecting on my life... I realise I am at my lowest point because I don't have ANY of those positive things keeping me afloat. I realised over the past 12 months that my friends don't like me all that much. I have stopped contacting them. I have no fitness activities or goals to keep me going like before, despite trying, no motivation. My role at work is unnecessary and I am considered as extra headcount that needs to be shifted elsewhere. I feel like a burden at work. I have a LOT of resentment for my mother for putting me in the position she did at a young age, which she STILL continues to do (she is still with my Dad and they are so horrible to each other).Then it leaves the last person, my husband, my 4 month old marriage, 3.5yr relationship. My biggest worry right now is that I am ruining my relationship with my husband and driving him into depression. I love him so much and I can't see a future without him, but I sincerely believe that he would find happiness with someone else. He could do a lot better, and he deserves much better. Don't know where to begin. I see no light. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi I'm new to this so please bare with me. 
I have suffered anxiety and PTSD most of my life and only started treating it 4 years ago. It took my now husband to tell me something wasn't right. My family always told me I was just emotional and overthinking everything and made me believe what I felt was what everyone felt.
i successfully went onto medication and sort help with a psychologist and everything was getting better despite how hard it was to talk about how I felt and The abuse I had been through as a child. 
last year my psychologist decided it was time to reduce my sessions and to call her when I needed her instead. I convinced myself I was doing great I was happy and confident and had convinced my self I was fine. 
I had even struggled with depression when I lost my grandfather last year and she felt I came through ok. 
In this last week I feel different I feel as though the depression has been creeping back and I've just been telling myself I'm ok, and convincing others the same. 
i honestly did not have a great childhood and now I do have a loving and caring husband who works so hard to give us the world and tries so hard to understand what I'm going through. But I know I make it very hard for him sometimes, I'm just feel neutral or down a lot of the time and have been constantly sick of late which has thrown off my medication and made things worse. 
I've been to Drs and now need to see a psychiatrist to change my meds. I don't feel I need my psychologist but I do feel lost and embarrassed that I have fallen back into this state that I tried so hard to convince myself I wasn't in.
Basically I just want to know if there is anyone that can relate, I just feel really alone at the moment even though my husband and work collegues are telling me they understand I just feel alone.

Help! I'm 25 with two kids, a husband & a business. I can't say that life is easy for me but I do have what a lot of people dream of but I can't seem to enjoy what I have worked for. Each day I wake I can barely put my thoughts together. After I have sorted my daughter for school. And got my son ready for either daycare or just a busy day with mum. My days are often spent fixing problems with in my business. I'm either trying to get paper work done or ordering or baking or cleaning no matter what I'm there everyday. If I was to pick up and leave not only would the place full apart but my anxiety just goes through the roof!!!! I strive to make things work but it all comes pilling on top. Then to top work of my husband family work with us from time to time when ""they need"" us. For years I feel as if I have never been good enough for his family. I feel has if they tear at me. Try to pull down my walls. I don't know what it is they want but my husband is always on there side. I feel so lost. Alone.Afraid. I feel as if I'm meant to be a hole In The wall. A memory not a person. After work is done its time for me to rush round picking kids up. Doing dinner trying to get the reading done. The washing done for school the next day. Keeping the house up to scratch. Only to put the kids to bed. By myself and not know if tonight I will sleep for 4 hours or 6 sometimes 2 hours sometimes my days flow from one to the next. I feel lost. I feel empty. I can't find happiness and my kids feel it the most my temper is short and my weight is at an all time low. I don't eat. I don't sleep an I'm afraid of what's next. I am alone in my own battle with myself. I'm suffocating and don't know what to do next

Hi All, My name is Tom. 30 years old and divorced for over  year. I was diagnosed with depression months ago, when my mind and body started to shutdown. My mind couldnt string one though together and my anxiety actually would be at the point of making my body and voice physically shake. Since being on my medication it had improved, however over the last couple of days I have really struggled again. At times I cant think straight and when i do it gets negative.Its such a battle, and a battle I think i have fought for years before asking for help. Im tired of my thoughts, my anxiety. I just wish for peace and quiet.. Thank you for just letting me speak what is in my mind. Iwould not wish this on anyone... Take care and I hope you keep fighting your battle.Tom

Hello
i have visited BB quite a bit but have only just signed up.
I have been seeing a counsellor for issues at work , over the last year, and I have been making some improvements as far as things not getting to me as much, although I have lost my passion for my job as a result. I have a supportive husband and son who is 21 and a teenage daughter who is busy being a teenage girl
I have had serious health issues over the years that seem to be resolving themselves but my problem is there still seems too much to fix.
Despite having a good immediate family I don't have that relationship with my extended family, on both sides they live away and aren't interested. My friends prefer to stay at home rather than go out and I feel I have no family, friends or workmates that I can talk to about my mental state ,work issues or even just go out with on a regular basis. My son  whom I am very close to is moving out soon and I know it is the next phase of his life, but I am feeling for my own loss as he truly is good company and understands me.( his moving out has been the instigation for signing up as I am devastated for myself and happy for him)
Sometimes I feel there is too much to fix about my life as I have been trying to work on many things over a number of years and am getting tired of it all. I feel very lonely often and as I am so unhappy at work this compounds the problem. 
I need help to fix my loneliness, learn to let go of things and have some peace where I am not trying to rectify some part of me that is not right.
Any ideas ?

I thought my depression and anxiety was getting better, I've been seeing a psychiatrist for the past year and after agreeing that my mental health was getting back on the right track I've stopped having sessions. That was 2 months ago and the first month leading into the new year I felt so happy and felt like I was slowly escaping it all. But this last month has just had my mental health spiraling back down again and I've found myself in the worst states and I don't know what to do about it. I was taken into hospital last week while on holiday with some friends and thinking back to that night and the mental place I was in scares me so much. I know I need to go back to my doctor but thinking about talking to anyone always makes me so nervous. I'm stuck on what to do and feel as if I've taken 100 steps back and sat at square one again..

Hi Guys,Where to start. I'll try to keep it brief.I' m 28, have suffered with depression for the last 10 years caused by a head injury when I was 18. Been on medication off and on since then but have been on the highest dose for around 4 years, I am been completely off it for the last 2 months. I am struggling. So so much. I have only been in Australia for just under two months having moved over with my boyfriend of over 3 years. There are a lot of firsts with this. First time we have lived together just the two of us, first time we have moved across the other side of the world together, first time I have been unemployed in a while etc etc. I'm really struggling. I' m so alone, spending so much time alone as he works 5 days a week, he has his mother and his sister here, I have nobody, I don't know anybody, we have so little money I'm trying not to spend anything so am not going out. He says I have a 'bad attitude'. That I'm being defeatist and negative about everything. Which is true. My mother is a very negative person and I think it's brushed off on me rather nicely. I'm taking everything out on him because there IS nobody else to take anything out on. I literally don't talk to anyone else unless it's on skype or whatever. And that's not talking. I just don' t know what to do, I'm not even really sure why I'm writing this I know other people have it much worse. I just have nobody. Why can I not just see the positives in life? Is my current mood just an effect of not being medicated in which case should I have stayed on them?  I'm fairly sure we're nearing break up because he says he can't be around negative people. Then in which case, I'm across the other side of the world all alone and don't have the money to go back home. So. Honestly though, I am feeling very defeatist today. I would be quite happy if the world came and swallowed me up because right now its just to much pain and uncertainty. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all,
I posted in here a little while ago about anxiety. A few months ago I went through an extremely stressful process at my work due to me putting in a complaint against an older man at my work. They turned the process around and I nearly lost my job. They ended up changing their minds when I threatened legal advice & I kept my job. During that process I developed anxiety - even though I was convinced it was going crazy! (I've never had it before) and now I believe I've got some depression symptoms.
Even though I kept my job, the feeling just hasn't gone away! I can't bring myself to go back to work after what they did to me so I'm currently in the process of going on income protection. I know I should consider myself lucky that I have a job, but it all just seems too much at the moment.
 The last month I have hardly left the house.  My family is worried & wants me to go & stay with them but I just want to be alone. I wake up every morning & it's just too much to get out of bed. My housemates tells me to 'stop feeling sorry for myself' which makes me feel even worse.
Before all of this, I lived a normal life for a 23 year old. I had a good job, friends & a life! Within 2 months, my life has turned & now here I am. A lazy depressed mess. I love life & I don't want to be like this but I've let it take over!
I'm seeing the doctor again & my first psychologist appointment on Tuesday - I hope it helps! 
Does anyone have any advice to get my life back on track? I WILL drive myself crazy if I stay in this room for another month.

What does living with depression feel like, why is it so bad. Well personally it feels like I am a hand grenade with the pin about to fall out. But how did the pin get loose. Well while the pin is in the pain increases so I pull it out a bit maybe turn my music up full ball and scream into a pillow, or randomly lock my self away and cry. The worst part of this is I have no idea why I am doing it. Sure I am not a millionaire and my job sucks arse at the moment but I am not the only one in the world with a shitty job and no money. I read once a beautiful website that was made to make you think before you commit suicide, obviously it worked and I use it daily. The line that sticks in my head is about the pain. Suicide is not chosen; it happens when pain exceeds resources for coping with pain. So why not take a pill and get over it. Well this is my bodies sick way of having a crack at me, you see antidepressants work for a time for some people they work for great. Others such as my self they last until you convince yourself that you don't want to look like a druggie and have to scoff pills daily so you stop taking them and pull the pain pin out a bit more to subside the pain and the vicious circle continues. I am a single dad of 3 young boys that I love to death, I would do anything to see them happy so at the moment I have that pain pin welded in but the pain is still there. I have found myself saying if their mother grows up and finds good man the boys won't need me any more and I can end my fight with the pain pin...lovely thought to live with right...... I wrote the above about two months ago. I just got a well paying job thought this would help subside the pain, well kind of hoped it would. But again I find my self putting on that brave face pretending to every one that I am fine. I just want out I am tired. I know that pills don't make me a druggie but my head screams at me everytime I consider them. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

today I saw my psychologist finally after a long 4 weeks. I have been feeling particular bad lately, due to recent changes in friendship and moving back to parents house, and she asked me if I'd had thoughts of hurting myself, which I had. So she said it was time to go back to the doc for a medication review because it's obviously not working. I feel sad and anxious about it, trying new medication. 
i just don't understand how or if I am ever going to truly ""get better"" if I've been like this my whole life? Like I don't know how to think or act any differently and yet I've been trying for the past year to get my life back on track but as I was told today I have spent more time 'watching life from the sidelines' then actually being involved...
I don't know why I'm posting, I just feel hopeless.

I got my parents to read it so they could properly understand what I feel like all the time. Even though they are supportive they still didn't fully understand until they read this.
Professor Jonathan Rottenberg - “I know of no better depiction of the guts of what it’s like to be severely depressed: Clutching your blanket, you are born into the baffling, boring, disorienting state that is depression – radically out of phase with the rest of humanity, unable to understand the concerns of other people, nor able to communicate yours to them.:

Hi all.
Didn't realise how hard it is to start off the first post! Obviously I am a newcomer to the site but thought I needed to try something. Why am I here???? Glad you asked. I am so over feeling upset and annoyed by things that apparently, should not really bother me that much. I do not enjoy feeling this way so often, and I just wish I could be the happy me more of the time. I am sure my wife feels the same about this too. I do tend to get upset/angry when things go wrong, especially if I am unable to steer events where I either think, or know they should go. I have little to zero tolerance for frustration. Unfortunately my reactions are apparently not commensurate with the situation. I accept this is true. I do not get physically violent, but fail miserably to control my ""verbal anger"" when my frustration reaches a certain level. Unfortunately, my poor wife is the only other occupant of our house so she is the only other person that deals with this. She says that once a bad or annoying situation has been rectified, I simply go looking for another one. And she is right. Negativity is my constant companion. Has been for as long as I can remember. I make no real attempt at making close friends as I feel as though people see me as silly, annoying, loud (I am partially deaf so I do tend to talk too loud like you do when wearing headphones), not as successful as them and generally not ""friend-worthy"". Other than my years as a muso, I have no hobbies or outside interests as I feel everyone will be looking at me, for all the wrong reasons........even though there might be many other people there too....I am the one that stands out because I feel awkward, ungainly, inept or just plain stupid. And yet, put me on a stage in front of thousands and I am Mr. Confident. And I loved it for nearly 30 years. Go figure! Lately I have become, I am sure, almost too much to tolerate and my fear is my wife will soon say she's had enough. I just do not understand me. No confidence. Always seeing the negative. The glass is not only half empty, but it should be a bigger glass too. I have relatively good health, a wife that I love and trust to the moon and back, and she loves me dearly also.  We are both employed and about to purchase another home together. We are certainly not rich but not struggling either. I find that my negativity to so much, frustrates me and cripples me and causes me to feel annoyed, therefore negative. Just one massive circle!! Am I unique??

My wife has jealously issues and is a control freak eg she hates it when i exercise as she's afraid that i'll be attractive to other girls. I'm often faced with ridiculous questions such as 'Do you love her?' and 'Do you wish you were with her and not me?' These concerns are unfounded, i've done nothing wrong and i haven't acted in a manner to raise concerns! It is her paranoia!
We have an absolutely gorgeous 5yo daughter. My wife suffered post natal depression and our marriage was on the rocks and a couple of years back we almost broke up. Over the last 18 months i made a real commitment for change, i thought we were getting closer, i thought things were getting better so i thought!
My wife's jealously issues continued e.g. two weeks ago i was interrogated by her because of a mutual work colleague who was flirting with me in front of her. I could understand her concerns you know beautiful 18yo girl throwing herself at me, it was flattering considering she is 23 years my junior but i didn't do anything to encourage this and i certainly didn't give in to temptation. But still i had to endure my wife's interrogation and repeated questioning and accusations. I can understand this!
Then last week she had another jealously fit, this time because i provided a former female work colleague with info to help for a job interview. How could anyone possibly be jealous over that? I don't understand!
But get this! I accidently found out over the weekend that she has been texting a former partner on a regular basis which has been going on for the last 18 months behind my back. I'm sure they're not talking about just the weather. She assures me that she is doing nothing wrong - maybe she is or maybe she isn't, i don't know! All i know is that she values his friendship!
But the thing that really gets me is that her jealously outbursts against me was disgusting and unfounded and then i find out she has been doing this over the last 18 months when we were supposed to be working on our marriage! If the above situation was reversed i would be subject to all sorts of accusations and rightly so.  But apparently for her to do this is perfectly acceptable, explainable, justifiable and i have no right to be concerned. So what does that make her?
Her double standards sicken me and i have never felt so distant from her. The last 18 months have been i lie and obviously her interpretation of working things out is different to mine! Can't stand the sight of her

Hey Everyone,
 
I'm Michael. I'm recently 19 years old. Basically ever since probably when I was around 14-15, I've had what I thought were bouts of depression every now and then, and other than that, nothing else too bad. However, I've come to see that this whole time, I've had a mild form of depression, punctuated by those occasional darker moments.

In reading about depression, I came across Dysthymia which seems to hit the nail on the head. I decided to take the plunge and see a doctor about it. I guess I didn't have the same great experience with doctors that people seem to have. It's not that she didn't believe me, but I felt like I had to talk myself up a bit around her. Make it like my symptoms aren't as bad as they are. In the end, she recommended I do a Medical Action Plan and then do psych sessions. Should I do this? They are all really expensive ad I don't know if I want to.

Towards the end, short of diagnosing me with dysthymia or depression, she commented that she thought I probably just had a generally more melancholic/ darker outlook than most people so it might not be anything, which worried me a little. 

Anyone had a similar experience? I really think I know what I have, but the Doctor doesn't seem to be on the same wave-length... but then again, she is a Doctor and I'm not. I'm a bit lost. Should I see another Doctor to double check or stay with this one?

Ok well of late been doing pretty good managing myself and my depression, doing DDP Yoga, riding a bike all in the name of getting rid of my walking cane (and man getting fit hurts!!). Well along comes my nephew in law and his wife and they moved in, they got kicked out of the place they were living in because of the fact that it was being sold (not to mention they lied and told the land lords/real estate people that they only had 2 dogs when in fact they had 6 dogs, 3 cats and a few birds). Well it happened faster then they were ready so I said they could move here, once they got rid of most of the animals especially since the wife and I already have one dog. Anyways, the kids (and the ""kids"" are 40 and 39 but really they are still kids in my eyes which I am only 39 lol) moved in, for a temporary place while they look for a new place to live. Well come to find out the Nephew in law's wife is in stage 5 kidney failure and needs to be on dialises and needs a new kidney. They have been trying to find a new place, well sort-of trying,
The kidney people said she needed another address closer to them (they were living in Bathurst and that is where the kidney doctor is in) in a month's time. NO way in hell will that happen so I told the kids to relax and they could stay here until everything gets properly sorted. As she has to go in ASAP to have the dialises set up soonest (surgery and all that). 
So once again doing the right thing turns around and bites me in the ass. So now I have 5 dogs, and three adults living here. My wife is menopausal and lashes out a lot of times before she can control her mouth, which means I am the one that gets the lashing. This does not help my depression one bit especially when I lash back at the wife then I feel like I am a total heel because I should be in more control then she is, this will not rip myself and the wife apart I know that, but ugg it really is putting me once again in a black mood as I try to keep the peace. Why is it that when we do the right thing it always bites us in the ass or is that just me? Last time I did the right thing by not sueing the lady that ran me over it just got me over 250k in debt a shattered body and mind.

I suffer both anxiety and depression on and off and have for years.  The last few weeks I've had depression and the last few days anxiety and sometimes both.  I find anxiety harder to cope with.  If I'm depressed I can cry or just sit and do nothing until I can pick myself up and hopefully feel better but anxiety, the sickness, the fear, the constant thoughts going around - it's debilitating, there's no relief .
what do others think? Do you find one easier to handle than the other?

Im very new here and not sure where to start. My usual personality is sarcastic, funny, silly, happy, hardworking and social. Im married to a wonderful man of 10 years and have two daughters.
I'm not sure what happened but on Boxing day 2014 I just remember something changing. We were away visiting family interstate and I went from wanting to be there to demanding that we had to go home. I didn't want to be there anymore and felt miserable. I ended up spending the reminder of the holiday in my room either asleep, crying or angry. 
This was the start. Its now February and nothing has changed. Things I once loved I have lost interest in. I feel so completely and utterly overwhelmed with my responsibilities as a mother and a wife. I feel as though one little thing has to go wrong and it will fester in my head and will make me feel nuts. I am restless at night and have a lot of trouble sleeping. I cry randomly for reasons I cant even verbalize and have withdrawn completely from social situations. Coming up with any excuse to avoid interaction. I get get so nervous about new situations that I make myself feel ill. I have no support from anywhere with my children and am so unappreciated in my life that I feel nothing but resentment towards others. I want to go to bed and do nothing everyday. I used to be able to get up at 5am everyday and go work out. Now its an effort every day to do anything. 
I have a husband, two daughters, loving family and a best friend. Not one of these people has picked up on any of this as I feel I can still hide this well. Husband does night shift and isn't home much to see and everyone else is so wrapped up in their own problems no one can see me crashing slowly. 
Im not sure if what I have is depression or if Im just sad. But I need to talk to someone and no one in my circle is ready to hear this. Im scared to go to my GP. I dont want to go and have him tell me its all in my head.

Hi - new to the forum today. One of those days that just is worse than usual.
Just feel the need to talk to someone - have suffered for many years - still on medication  given up on seeing a counsellor as over the years have done so -  on and off - just seemed to make no difference and in the end felt like they only cared if you keep coming back and paying your fee.
Some days it would be nice if those around you just took the time to say - How are you? and actually showed some compassion.
Feel very alone and pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I can not be helped and my life will always be with black clouds hovering over me
Sorry to put this out there - but just needed an outlet to try and get though the rest of the day

Hi
I'm male, 55, employed in a job I don't particularly like and feel depressed more than I should.
Second marriage, with 4 kids 22 - 30 (2 each). I feel empty. I feel as I don't fit. I can be outgoing but in
social functions unless I make the move, I'm usually left on my own. Even when I am in situations, people tend to leave quickly to find another group. Maybe I'm boring but I do ask mostly about the person I'm talking to. I thought that made people...happy and that they would think I was ok. Sometimes it doesn't feel that way.
I am in real estate; now a corporate gig and no longer selling. My colleagues are ok and so are the agents except for a few which I dislike with a passion. There's no room for growth and no prospect to earn more money.
Money is a big part of my depression. I have a house in a street I hate because of my neighbours. It's full to the brim with debt because myself and wife blow our credit cards sky high. I can't ever see myself getting out of debt. Servicing the debt takes up the majority of my income. I pay my credit cards then use them to live during the month. It's a vicious cycle.
No mun equals no fun. I struggle to do things but sometimes do by loading up the credit card or getting another one of the premise that one day all will be good. It never comes. I'm a Lotto addict at about $80-$100/mth.
I'm anxious about no meeting my financial commitments especially where children are concerned. My 2 kids (22 & 28) are prime for engagements, weddings soon and I wont be able to contribute a cent. It depresses me greatly.
I've tried extra things to make money. Mostly network marketing and have failed for the last 20 years. Virtually no return. I've tried selling on Amazon,eBay etc - all with no success. My latest brain child is book writing. I'm starting fiction writing after non fiction has earned me $100 in 3 years.
My weight is 123kg - about 30 kg overweight. My doctor tells me that I've gained 15kg over the past decade. Ten years ago I lost my Mum having said goodbye to my Dad. I got an inheritance after I sold the family home. Within 18 mths I blew it all; not intentionally but nothing was left. The money I sunk into the house has all gone to credit card debt.
I'm lost. I don't know where to turn to. I've hesitated coming here thinking that I'll be sharing and listening to guys with dramas. Broken people can't fix broken people.
Am I wrong? Is there REAL help here?
Thanks for reading

Hi everyone.  I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for a number of years and in July last year was hospitalised.  I have since then been taking my medication religiously, talking to psychologists, psychiatrists putting into practice the coping strategies and feel that I am slowly getting better, so why am I having daily thoughts of suicide???These thoughts are stronger now than when I was at my lowest!  Please has anyone else had the same?I am booked to see another psych this week.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm. At the same time, general supportive comments from the community are encouraged. If you have concerns around suicide or self-harm, please phone our support service on 1300 22 4636.

Hi I'm scott
I have been falling back in to the hands of depression now for over a year it has slowly gotten worse now it has got a full hold on me atleast 1 in 3 days I'm so badly depressed I just lay in bed pretty much running over my issues time and time again and hating my self for how I feel and for letting things get like this.
No matter how much time I spend going over my issues I can never find a solution.
So storey as short as I can.
I have been in a relationship about 8 years have 2 children. But started to no longer love my partner about the time the depression began actuelly started to hate being around her.
She changed I changed both our lives were going in different directions we started to not share the same interests. Then I started to have feelings for a good friend who I've known for awhile now like 6 years. Started getting really close she suffers depression I was one of her supports we talk nearly every day some times for 6hrs straight.
I started to talk with her about my issues to about my failing relationship mostly. One day I was stupid and told my friend I liked her this nearly cost me our friendship a few months later things came good again with me and her was like I never said it things were good there. But my feelings remained.
A few weeks after this My partner went in to my fb and txts and read every thing while I was asleep and at work so we broke up. She moved out after 6 weeks we decided to try and make things work well it's not it's making me depressed and angry and well I am still crazy for this friend of mine 9 months on this is were it gets hard.
So this girl and I talk every day still about alot we can talk about nothing and still make each other smile and laugh. A few weeks ago she told me she dreamed about me and her going out some were together and romanticly kissing each other.
Now clearly this made things harder for me as I like her. Since then till now just over a month she has gotten really close and touchy feely with me one day it's like she wants to give us ago next she shuts me out puts up a force field I have not told her I still like her. There is alot more but I think you get the idea I'm lost.
I want to leave my partner im unhappy but scared to lose my kids and I want to tell this girl I still like her but I'm scared to lose her if she still only wants a friendship. Thanks for reading

Hello to all other posters out there,
This is my very first post on beyond blue, and I'm trying this out as an alternative therapy I guess you could say. 
I personally have suffered with depression since I was around 5 years old, (21 years of depression) I don't understand a world any differently and I still struggle to get my loved ones to understand what it is I'm going through. For years I've been told to toughen up, get over it, your being a princess, you've lost it, your crazy and the worst ""its all in your head you can choose to be happy if you really want to, do you want to?"" and sometimes you ask yourself are you really just a crazy person?
I feel guilty for having this illness, I feel weak and insecure. Sometimes I find a book or exercise (I do not find exercise takes away depression like they tell you it does I am extremely fit)  to be the best escape sometimes other illegal methods are all that can numb the pain. (I'm very aware this does not help in the long run) 
I personally have been diagnosed with Clinical depression, but recently thinking over my struggles in some length and sending a lot of time researching it seems more of a Borderline Personality Disorder.  (waiting to be tested)
I'm wondering if anyone else can provide me with their information/ experiences with  BPD? and can you have both clinical and BPD?
Any insight would be fantastic, honestly I'm trying to keep a positive facade for others but as the years go by its getting harder and harder to keep going forward.

Hi beyond blue forums, this is my post and hope i dont sound too pathetic.
 I have been struggling against depression for over a year now mostly by just burying it down and denying any presence of it. But the last 2 months have completely rocked my mental health. 
Two weeks before christmas i lost my job with a company i loved, which was upsetting but not the end of the world as i could spend more time with family during the holidays.
 Then mid january i lost my uncle to cancer. He has left behind two young daughters and a devoted wife and it breaks my heart these girls have to continue on without this strong soul by their side. However i really do feel selfish that i mention that this is bothering me as it is those girls who feel the most pain while i sit here complaining online.
After the funeral, I was then told by my girlfriend of a year  a few days later that she no longer had any feelings for me anymore and had been forcing herself to be with me while i mourned the impending death of a loved one. I was also told on the day that my other uncle had just been diagnosed with throat cancer. 
It has been two weeks since then and I am reaching the end that i feel i can keep a happy face on. In general, I am a very positive person who can always manage to keep a happy face on. But these last few days have really been hard. I am still out of work and sit up most nights struggling to push out the negative thoughts in my head. 
I have been forced to move back in with my mother and currently the only friends I have are those that play online playstation with me. I'm not sure what i hoped  to acheive by posting on here but in all honesty i truely am struggling to find what I have to offer anymore and am sick and tired of saying to myself that surely these bad times will come to an end soon. I feel like I am just feeling sorry for myself and hoping that someone else might pity me, which makes me feel like a worthless human being.

thats it really. Title of this post says it all. It's time to accept that I'm quick to tears. Time to accept that not being able to breathe sometimes is a depression related symptom, not anything else. Time to accept I have to actively shield myself from the news sometimes. Time to accept I must just go for a walk on the bad days. Time to accept that I don't know what I want to be when I grow up and to accept that I must have change to feel normal and or excited.
 I've often felt that I'm better, but I never have been. I've just never honestly been able to accept there's a real problem.  Which means I've never been able to appreciate the good days.

I'm not sure if it's depression...some people tell me it could be though.
I know you're all not necessarily doctors or educated in this but if any of you can help it'd be greatly appreciated:
 I feel tired and weak all the time. I sweat at the smallest physical exertion. When the day is moderate sunny temperature, I'm sweating and no one else is.
When I was younger, I still sweat more than the average person, but not as easily.
When I was 20, I used to be able to write songs at the drop of a hat. Now I'm 24 and to even write one line is a struggle. Every time I try to write, I'm tired after 5 minutes and can't go on.
 It feels like I'm walking around with a rock in my head sometimes, weighing me down. My brain feels clouded. I can't recall words as easily as I used to be able to. I've had this problem for about 2 years now.
This morning I woke up and I felt so fatigued and drowsy and clouded I could barely get up.
Does anyone know what could be wrong with me?

I've been feeling fantastic recently, especially the past couple of weeks. It's felt like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders after being depressed for so long, and I was back to my confident overachieving self.  But I'm worried. Is it a manic phase, or is the depression lifting? I'm worried about the impression I might have made on my psychologist last week. My head was filled with a million thoughts, racing around, and I know I was talking very fast, and was very excited (I've just bought a new house you see). I was talking nonstop, jumping from topic to topic. Anyway, someone from her office called me ""for follow up"". That's not happened before. I was immediately terrified that she's send men in white coats to come and get me. I thought I might have to run off into the bush and hide. I haven't returned the call. How do you tell the difference between feeling genuinely elated and excited, and being mildly manic? I've been fretting about being bipolar for a while. I've never been diagnosed with anything. In the hospital the psychiatrist just said that ""I seem pretty depressed""

I am a 43 year old mum of two great teenage boys.  I have been in a relationship for a year with a wonderful man who has been so patient with me, yet I have been a mess most of our time together.  I am usually depressed, accusing him of things that are unwarranted, no fun to be with, and find it very hard (almost impossible) to accept he loves me and for me to love him without putting up barriers and walls.  I know my issues aren't unique, but I have loathed myself pretty much my entire life.  I am deaf.  I have never felt worthy.  My mother has never once in my life told me she loves me.  She treats me badly and as a girl, she never bought me nice clothes so I was always the poorest dressed of my friends.  I never felt I belonged anywhere, always feeling like a square peg in a round hole.  I need to get better, like myself so I can stop sabotaging my relationship, and accept that he does love me.

I feel like everything in my life that could go wrong, has or is and when I think it can't get worse it always does. I'm about a breath away from giving up and just stopping. My beautiful daughter lifts my spirit when I'm having bad days like this, she is the reason I'll keep going.The worst part is half of my problems and fears probably don't even exist.Is there anyone else that just feels like giving up everyday before they get out of bed? Does anyone else lay in bed until 3am worrying and thinking? What the hell is wrong with me???I need to be better for my girl.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I am having the worst anxiety and depression I've ever had, it's been 6 weeks now and I'm getting worse.  I've been seeing a Pschycologist for a year, I've done all the things she said to do do but I've found no relief,
I haven't been back to work, lucky my manager is understanding.  I can't leave my house, I don't enjoy anything and all I do is cry.  I'm dizzy and feel like I'm having a heart attack everyday.  I've been to the ED at the hospital, they ran tests and say all is ok.
I've done the breathing, meditation, healthy eating, vitamins, talking to someone but the feeling just remains.  I can't take Meds due to sensitivity from side effects, the hospital gave me an anti depressant that sent me to bed for 5 days, I couldn't even stand up without help.
I tried a natural tablet and that made me nauseous, dizzy and I couldn't eat for a week.
 I have come to the conclusion, no one can help me and I'm doomed to this life forever, I will probably end up losing my job because when I get up of a morning I break into a cold dizzy sweat and want to throw up, I then have to collapse back on the bed for a few hours.
my daughter has tried getting me help through the mental health system, an anxiety clinic and the hospital but even they can't seem to help apart from give advice.
 I hate being here, I wouldn't ever do anything but I still hate it

Hi everyone. First time posting here and I'm not really sure why I am, only that I need some advice and after reading some stories on here nothing seemed to fit with mine.
Basically I am 22, the last year has been pretty rough I guess, I've moved from NSW to Melbourne and then back again when I realised I wasn't happy there with my partner. My partner and I have been together for two years, and are still happy together, living in Melbourne was just very stressful considering we were both doing jobs we hated and had no friends or family there. We have now moved back home and are living at his parents' house (which I hate, we are soon moving to my parents' house) to save money while we both go back to uni. The first degree I did I hated, so I'm going back to do what I wanted to do all along.
I'm fortunate enough to be able to go to uni (twice), have supportive parents and partner, we're ok financially (not great as we are both students but we earn enough to keep us going) so I'm not sure why I feel like this. The last 12 months or so I have just felt so sad all the time. I feel unmotivated to do anything, whenever I'm at home I just lay in bed all day or watch tv and don't have any motivation for doing anything. I am always tired, I went to a doctor about being so tired around 2 years ago and he told me I was Vitamin B deficient and to take supplements, I have ever since and it got better for a while but now it's worse than ever so I feel like it must be something different. I'm so tired that I have to have a nap every afternoon because I physically cannot stay awake.
Again, I don't know why I'm posting here except that I've ruled out every other possibility. I don't feel like I have a reason to be depressed but I can't ignore the fact that I am just plain sad all the time for no good reason. The last year I have been saying to myself ""I'll be happy when we move to Melbourne"", ""I'll be happy when I move home"", ""I'll be happy when I quit this job that I hate"", ""I'll be happy when I lose weight"", but I've done all those things and I'm no happier.
Just wanting some advice basically and to talk to people who have been through similar things. Sorry for the long post. X

Hi, I am a new member. I have recently been diagnosed with depression. My first ever experience with depression happened when my eldest was 15mths old (he is now almost 16). I used to cry all the time and came close to leaving my hubby and child. I called hubby at work on a particularly bad day and said I need help. I was put on medication for a couple of mths then came off it to have our 2nd child.  Since then I would often have times of feeling down, but as I have always worked part-time since having the kids (2 boys aged 16 & 13) I found using my days off while the kids were at school was enough to get me through. Since that episode 15 years ago I have never confided in anyone (including hubby) about my down times.  Last July I started a new role full-time and since then have not been coping, I cry all the time, mood swings and just generally feel really down.  In early November I finally sought help from a doctor who put me on medication.  I found I went downhill even more and very quickly for those couple of mths on the medication that I took myself off it. I have seen a psychologist twice now & my next appt is mid Feb. the psychologist recommended a 2nd opinion for my medication which I recently have done and am now on a new medication.  I have a family history of Bipolar on my Dad's side. I honestly don't know if I have bipolar, I can get very obsessed about projects/ideas where it controls me for days/weeks to then just give up on it without seeing it through.  The psychologist has not given me a diagnosis of anything as yet (not sure if they even do this). I believe I have a social anxiety also, as I get really anxious and feel like people don't like me. So tend to want to be on my own if I can. My main concerns are as I mentioned I haven't told hubby yet, I don't know why but I get really scared and nervous when I try to get up the courage to tell him.  Also I know my work is not helping, but we are just starting to get ahead financially so would feel so guilty and blame myself if I had to cut back my hours but I do know if I don't start improving will have to consider this option.  Any advice on telling partners especially since I have kept it from everyone for so long would be appreciated. I feel so alone and terrified about what's ahead.

Hello everyone i am new here my name is Kargroth i am 27 yrs young and i have recently been diagnosed withDepressive Anxiety Disorder and Insomnia. recently in 2011 i lost my father, lost my job and recently come out of a three year marriage, yes i know they say bad things come in three's. i am just writing to find out if anyone else has the same disorder as me to be able to relate to this disorder to be able to chat with. it seems of late since leaving my wife of only 3 years, everyday is a struggle. very had to find the motivation to find a new job and im currently also finding it hard to find myself new housing as i am only on a low government income. 
 I have a just recently turnt 4 yr old daughter whom i regard as my everything. i have only seen her 3 times since i split up from my wife.
(1) Christmas Day.. 26th December
(2) Day before her Birthday 13th January 
(3) Yesterday 30th January
I am trying to negotiate with my ex wife to see her more often. It hurts me more-so when i have to leave and my daughter doesn't want me leave and don't understand that ""daddy no longer lives at home with mummy"" i often find myself crying myself to sleep at night. ( when i do sleep )
 
Thank you for taking the time to read my story

Hi everyone,
Long time admirer of beyondblue, first time user of a forum..
I've never really thought of myself as depressed, but looking back over the last 12 months, it seems likely that I am.
 Nearly 18 months ago, I started having problems with a colleague. It took me a while to realise there was actually an issue, as the problems were in the form of passive aggressive emails which I initially took very little notice of. Fast forward 15 months, and my generally happy self had finally been worn down to the point I had to make a complaint. My employer has sent me to a psychologist, and I have had two sessions with him. To be honest, I don't know if I'm getting much out of them.
I noticed my mood had changed - probably over the last six months. I am not as confident as I was, my motivation has decreased and I frequently have no energy.
I may have been better able to deal with this, had I had a little more support from my partner. When things at work began to get problematic, I tried talking to him, but he seemed not to realise I was attempting to have a serious conversation with him, and interrupted me. This happened several times and I just gave up trying to talk to him.
I feel like we never talk about anything of any substance. We started having problems of our own which, to be honest, had been brewing for awhile.
Between Christmas and January, I was feeling quite a lot better, but I am back in a black hole again now, due to an issue with my partner a couple of days ago.
I feel like if my problems were just related to work OR home I could deal with them, but I am feeling unbearably sad - it is the only way to describe it. I feel like I am a fraction of my former self and I don't know how to get back to where I was.
I guess in posting on here, I am wondering if anyone might have some practical tips for 'getting back to happy,' and also getting a relationship back to a happy, but perhaps more open, state.
I know compared to a lot of other people's posts, these things seem quite trivial. I think it is for this reason I have just tried to figure out how to deal with things on my own, but it is becoming quite apparent that I need some help.
Would really like to hear if anyone has felt the same, and what might have helped them.
Thank you.

I don't have severe clinical depression. I am able to get up and work part time in my own business, and cook most nights for three teenage boys. I am a single parent, my ex-husband having passed last year after four years of pain and suffering following a heart attack. He was only 49. For four years the kids and I have been in a traumatic limbo with my ex having brain damage and DVTs and cellulitis and other issues.  With his passing late last year so many people have said ""Now you are all free to move on"" etc.  They mean well. And it is true we are now in a place to move on with our lives. After 4 years of carrying my children through this I am now exhausted. I find myself sleeping a lot. I'll get up in the morning and make my youngest breakfast and get him off to school with a healthily lunch etc ... then when he's gone I'll go back to bed until he comes home again. This happens at least twice a week. I feel ashamed.My life is not that bad. My boys are healthy and after a really hard time the two older ones are now in Uni. My business is doing OK. I have to be careful with money and I have learnt to budget! I have good friends and a dysfunctional but somewhat loving family in another state. I have even met a lovely man who has held my hand through this ordeal for some time now.So why do I go to bed. When I know I should go for a walk or do the food shop or wash the floors? I feel like I am just doing what I need to do to get through and I feel ashamed of my sadness ... I don't want to talk about it to people anymore because I feel like I'm just boring those who care about me. After last year hitting my rock bottom :( I started to see a psychologist and psychiatrist to help me. I went on anti depressants just after my ex husband's heart attack and put on 10 kilos in 6 months...one day I would love to come off them. Some days I feel fine and feel like I am going to be OK. And then there are days when I just feel so sad.  Anyway ... thank you for letting me share.

hiive been suffering from depression for most of my life but didn't realise it until I was diagnosed roughly 3 years ago, since then I have been on medication and saw a counsellor at one point. it's getting to the point where I feel nothing helps and I feel like imuseless, everyday feels like a struggle and ive found ive become very distant from family and friends avoiding any social interaction where I can. theres even days I cannot bring myself to go to work and even got fired from my previous job for that reason, I got a new job but still am finding it hard to get up to go. and the past few weeks I feel I have fallen deeper in the hole of depression, its a struggle to even be happy and it seems I have to keep a fake happiness appearance to not let people know. for the past year on and off I even turned to smoking pot to try and suppress these intense feelings even though I know its only making things worse. im trying to cut drugs out and seek real help, ive let this depression get out of hand and it wasn't until today I realised I really need to seek further help. I went to my gp to get help with a mental help plan but he didn't seem to want to do anything so im now searching for a new gp.is there any advise out there to try and keep it under control? its to a point where I have no control over my own feelings and found myself balling my eyes out today for no apparent reason and couldn't shake that feeling for a few hours until my wife came home from work to comfort me and help seek support. thank you beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I've suffered from depression and anxiety for a while now, I had really bad postnatal depression after my son. I just haven't seemed to get better. I take tablets and have tried multiple ones and these are the best ones so far. I've  been having little episodes alot lately like always being down, hate myself, my weight, my life. My oh does fifo 8&6 so its a great swing and we have a 2yr old. I'm really angry all the  time and just not happy but I really don't know what's wrong with me. I have had several counsillors  and speak to get things of my chest as I've lost my son in 2008 and had a crap time from about 14yrs old to 22yrs old as I was on drugs and in bad relationships and abusive ones. I have not touched drugs for at least 4-5 years am not interested in them. I just don't know what's the  problem my past does haunt me as I'm an over thinker and a worrier and always have reoccurring worries about one of my exes. I used to be confident and happy but i could cry at a heartbeat. I drink alcohol because it makes me feel good (at the time) I've had a few episodes we're i actually drink too much and lose it, always in front of my loved ones. It's like I blame them I'm not sure at all. In saying that i drink maybe once or twice a week, but when i do i write myself off and wake up feeling sorry and saying sorry for what I've done. I'm going to stop it as its getting beyond a joke as over  a fn ago i was so drunk i tried to take my life. I know I'm a good person and i want to be strong for my son and my partner but I'm just so sad.

Ok just throwing words out on to paper.. Here goes. I have suffered from social anxiety for many years, since I was at uni when I was 18. Now I am 28 (eeesh).
Sometimes I think it is the case of the chicken or the egg in terms of depression leading to social anxiety or the other way around. For example, if I experience depression, it makes it very hard to be around friends or family because I lose interest in connecting. It is really hard to talk, string sentences together, laugh, keep up in conversation. And it is a drain, because cognitively you are not alert (really bad short term memory) and it is hard to muster the fake enthusiasm to have anything to say. I find that to be a real battle, when I am deeply depressed, I lose interest in most things and it is very hard to connect and feel passionate about these things. When it is so hard to talk, it places a big strain on relationships, significantly when meeting new people and when you are so low on energy, the likelihood of people not understanding why you are withdrawn (even trying as hard as possible to put on a happy face) is high, at least for me. I notice that my relationships are really strained when I feel depressed and it makes me embarrassed. I can't connect with my friends and family, let alone strangers. And then you become anxious about socialising because it often doesn't go very well, it's draining or you come across disinterested.
 This anxiety then makes you feel more depressed because you feel trapped in not being able to connect. I know this sounds quite defeatist, but this is what I am struggling with at the moment. I am experiencing depression because I am finding it hard to connect with people and this also fuels anxiety in knowing that speaking to people is often not going well because I am so clamped down cognitively by depression (not being able to concentrate or muster up excitement).
I feel really trapped by this and it is hard to get out of this cycle of loneliness of wanting to connect with others, but knowing that you are not in the state of being able to truly connect because of the fog. This awkwardness leads to a lot of rejection. Which encourages me to stay where it is safe. Especially seeing as though I have pushed many people away and have caused myself to become quite isolated.
Just thoughts on the page. Sorry if it is long winded but I got it at least out of my head.

Hi - new to the forum - hope to get a few ideas from the group.I've was diagnosed with chronic depression about 8months ago and suspected of having it since late primary school (22years ago?). Due to severe bullying through-out school, I developed poor social skills and was quick to anger; getting into fights regularly (more like me crying and swinging punches). I consequently used video gaming to hide from life's anxieties/fear of people [currently working on reducing gaming - taken a long time to connect with how problematic it is] Maybe took this long to get diagnosed due tochronic low-level depressionbut also having a child recently to really see how sensitive I was to stress (especially baby's crying).Managing better with medication for 3months now - might be due for a dose increase. Been very stressful lately with suicidal thoughts creeping back in - moving house for work (both of us) and low on money. I've been slow to look for short-term work -both out of fear of 'blokey' workplaces and my resume screams Temporary! I'm a new casual educator (looking for full time now) so I haven't had much work over the holiday, except working for my Dad’s trade business. Guess it's been a hard road coping with being a dad (love my daughter :) but living up to the responsibilities I've never really had before - both sustained work / income / family / relationship + my own time that isn't Gaming...Luckily I don't drink very much (2 drinks a WEEK) or use drugs very often or have ever of that matter (am I in the minority?) – someone accused me of being all straight-edge once J I guess I'd like to hear what others have experienced - I know comparing isn’t that helpful so I'll try not to 'measure up'.Also tips on managing gaming - motivating myself or goal setting as well - any ideas on that would be appreciated. Any advice I'd like to hear - I'm better now to have written it down (given my girlfriend too much stress already) so thanks for reading and hope to hear from someone.

My name is Kait. I have a multitude of acronyms that go with my name, CDC, GAD, OCD,PTSD just to name a few. I am lucky, because I have incredibly supportive friends and family behind me, as well as a really good doctor and a fantastic psychologist. I have access to all this help, but alas - I am lacking a fundamental skill. I cannot, in the 20 years I have been living this part of my life, talk about feelings. I'm not talking about struggling to establish rapport with someone, I mean that I can't actually recognize most emotions. Thank God for my support network. They understand that ""it feels like wanting to throw a chair"" means, ""I'm angry"", and ""there's an elephant sitting on my chest"", means ""I'm anxious"". Does anyone else have this problem? Like your mind has shut down completely to emotions, and you can only recognize physiological symptoms?Telling my story is difficult, only because I can never get the ""feelings words"" right.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hello everyone. 

I am 23, female. 
I have never gone to a professional to say something is wrong or to ask if something is wrong with me.
I talk to a friend and he tells me I need to talk to someone and seek help. 
But I cant seem to take that step. Part of me doesn't want to go tell a doctor or someone else. 
I don't want to ask for help. 
I don't want something to be wrong. 

I have time lately where I feel I need help and want to call out for it. 
But then. 
I doubt myself the next moment. Do I need any help at all? 
I feel part of me is just making it all up or i'm making a mountain out of a mole hill.

Even more so today when a close friend told me she has a tumor in her neck. 
I just feel like my issues arnt important. 

I have anxiety. and a few panic attacks. 
I get stressed out a lot. 
I get super frustrated at people and things if they don't go the way I want, with super simple things. 
I feel a bit up and down. 
I don't feel like im in a dark depression where I cant get out of bed. but im not happy. 
but then I can have moments where im suddenly excited like tomorrow is Christmas. where I smile and nearly laugh and im not sure why. 
My life is on the up. But im not happy, I feel like im getting more anxiety. 
I cant sleep at night with out the tv on, and get worked up at the smallest sounds. 
and other issues and feelings. 


I don't no what to do next. 
Are my issues nothing? 

If not, what are the first words you say? 
How do you ask for help? 
Is there a easy way? 
I feel sick to my stomach just thinking about it.

Hi All,
 I will be brief although I could go on for ever as most of you probably know when you ask yourself one question more and more begin to fill your mind.
 I have had chronic depression for roughly six years however it was only diagnosed the past 6 months. The diagnosis was a huge relief as it explained why I felt the way I do and overall I am really positive about my future. However the one thing I am very confused about is the effect that my depression has had on my relationship with my now ex girlfriend.
Our relationship has been a pretty volatile one and involved long distance. I broke up with her and she made many attempts to win me back but in the end we parted ways on good terms shortly before I finally went to the doctor, found a psychologist and was diagnosed with depression.  Now looking back on or time together its clear that a lot of the problem was my behaviour however I am smart enough to see she was also at times less than awesome. But its hard to see whether I really don't want to be with her or if I pushed her away because it seemed all too hard. 
Now I just see saw between regret and a massive desire to win her back and then doubt because I still don't trust my judgement and I don't want to confuse her or waste her time.
I was just wondering if anyone has found themselves in this situation and if they lost that person how they came to terms with it. Or if they went for it and it worked out and how it worked out.
Thanks :) Lew

What a crap day - a day I sit here and write about at midnight when once again I am wide awake. I am trying to make decisions - whether to live or die. I think the world will be a better place without me but then a small part of me wants to live, wants to keep going but it is such a lonely trail - one that so many do not understand or even try to understand. Me, well now I have a new understanding of what depression feels like, I will never, and I mean NEVER scoff at someone who says they are depressed again. I now have an idea at how dark their hole must feel, at how different each hole must be in darkness, depth and in despair as it can change day to day. I now know what it feels like to be at the end with little if anything to look forward to. Once such a strong person, always in control, successful and respected - that has now all gone. Each morning as I struggle to wake, my body does not respond, hands and feet are puffy and my mind an empty space full of fog. . Your eyes refuse to focus and I find myself having to wear my glasses continuously. I stumble to the bathroom, mouth dry wondering what today will bring and how I will face it with only 2-3 hours sleep. I must say I have (or HAD) a lovely dr. She seemed to understand and I felt like I could be me with her. She guided me and made decisions for me that I could not make. But now I am faced with a new Dr, one I do not know and who will probably send me off to the mental home. If they have not gone on this journey with me then how do they know. My psychologist, lovely too, but when I hear her say 'it is just a job' about my work, I wonder if I am 'just a job' or a number too. I want to tell her I have a plan when she asks but am too afraid and I sit in silence, she will know what I am talking about. I wonder if she noticed I had been self-harming at our last appt. I have been thinking about suicide a lot. I take medication 3 x a day - I take and wait for it to work, they are suppose to stop the panic attacks but as I lie here I feel no effect at all. They changed my dose of medication too - it makes me tired, useless, out of control and now extreme anger. And that is what made my day so bad. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

After 3 years I feel like I have almost got a handle on managing my depression which saw me hospitalised for 3 weeks in 2012.
However I struggle every day with tiredness, lethargy and a lack of motivation which has a real impact on my ability to work, get out of bed and fully lead my life. 
Does anyone have any tips on how I can deal with these issues?

I'm dealing with depression, and am looking to connect. My last post attempting to introduce myself was too long and wasn't published... and I don't know how to make my story concise. Anyway, hi everyone.

This is my first post on here. My story is that I'm 27, hold a good steady job and earning quite good money and ""appear"" to be in quite good physical shape and I smile to most people I meet. My colleagues and anyone that meets me would probably say I do quite well for myself and would probably say I'm a ""nice guy"". NO FRIENDS However, that's where people are wrong. Since moving to Melbourne in 2006 for uni I have struggled to maintain old friendships and have never really developed any close friendships. I've always been depressed over this. I put on a fake front that I'm doing OK, when I have no one in my life who I can truly call my friend. HEALTH ISSUES + NO SUPPORT = DEPRESSIONI injured my knee 18 months ago in 2013. I couldn't walk and was house-bound for 3 months. This included knee reconstructive surgery, which failed 4 months later. I had another surgery in 2014 and have worked really hard to be able to walk and even stand up and sit down. I will have another surgery again next month. I had my former best friend from high school say to me last year he had ""no sympathy"" for me when I caught up with him in Sydney (we don't see each other that often). Those words hurt really bad and I've since lost my friendship with him and pretty much everyone I know! I spend every night alone and I have no friends or family in Melbourne to help me. I messaged my closest friend from uni I am having my third surgery next month and all she replied was ""Sorry to hear. Good Luck"". I truly have no one. I take care and look after myself, even though I struggle with a permanent limp, permanent pain (physically and emotionally).A thought that runs through my head is ""If I ended it all tomorrow, how many people will turn up to my funeral?"" I would hope my Mum and Dad who live 3 hours away and my sister who lives in London would attend. I'm not close to anyone else.  TRYING TO MEET NEW PEOPLEI've unsuccessfully tried to meet new people, through music (I play piano, guitar and do some songwriting), but this hasn't worked out.  I've tried playing sports, but I can no longer do this due to my bad leg. I can also no longer play my favourite sport ""tennis"" and will probably never run again (I haven't run since the day Iinjured my knee).   NEXT STEPSNot really sure what to do next. I will have my surgery again and will rehabilitate on my own without any help from anyone (with the exception of my physiotherapist which is a massive expense).

I've never really been able to work and I'm approaching a point in life where I am struggling to find  a purpose.I have an inheritance in the form of property which is where I live. Currently I'm facing a lot of debt because I didn't have parents around to teach me about money when I was younger and here I am ten years later with no clue. been thinking about selling it for a while as it only costs me money I will never have.

Well it's 5pm & I'm already in my Pjs waiting till 9.30pm to take my night time medication so the tablets will just knock me out & my thinking stops. This wasn't how my life was meant to be, the feeling of worthlessness surrounds me & I wonder who actually knows how to help me? Tablets, small goals, doctors appointments, I even went as far as getting a life coach,  it's consumed my life, yet l still wonder what is it I'm meant to be doing most days & ask myself why isn't this going away, I'm doing what they tell me, do they know what their doing? I feel nothing but a flatline, it's like I'm in slow motion, yet others are trained to live life to the fullest, no problems! Why can't l be that person? Why is my brain different? Why is everything such an effort, why does nothing including food ever full me up? It's like l want someone to finally turn my switch on, l want to feel, l want to belong without questioning myself constantly! Now here l am online searching for others because lm wondering if l can connect with them, I'm wondering if there is hope for a person with depression or if l will feel this way for life?

Hi everyone, Firstly i wanted to thank everyone who has replied to any of my posts.Its great to see people still care about other people in this day and age.
So yes i have crashed back to earth. Not in the biggest way. But my anxiety has returned. 
Ive been back to the psychiatrist and he has now given me some meds to ""take the edge off"" when i feel anxious. Im desperate to avoid taking them but sadly have been forced to a couple of times now because i honestly didn't know how to get through the day. 
The depression hasn't been as bad as before. I do sometimes feel like i dont want to leave the house which might be a mixture of depression and anxiety. 
Im now starting to realise that i need more help. But reliving my past experiences is so painful that im really not sure where to start. Im scared that when i seek further help i will revert back to where i was 6-8 months ago. I dont want to go back to that. So now im stuck. Once again i dont know how to move forward. 
I will be perfectly honest, although im very scared to write it down, but i have started wondering if its worth even going on. Wondering i have any reason at all for being. I really am just going through the motions. im starting to feel like a very empty shell. Its not a feeling i like.
So i guess the depression is probably worse than i thought since i started the post. Im not suicidal but just unsure where i fit into the world. 
So i will sign off and just say thanks for reading and i hope to return again soon. Ps. i do have another appointment with my psychiatrist on Wednesday next week so it might be a good idea to tell him how im feeling. 
Take care everyone :) 
Brad

Hi all,This is my first post...just a brief outline of myself. Im a 52 y/o male, lost parents in my 20,s. married 3 kids then divorced , then sole parent of my kids after the X fell into heavy drugs. Met a woman at 36 y/o  we had twin girls,(now 14). when twins were 6 months we separated and she moved 400km away.and dont see them much anymore. Now with the best woman in the world (5yrs) and we have one kid each living at home both males early 20s.I lose my temper more often at kids,and last time was physical wrestle with my son,ive lost interest in my landscape business and it has all but folded, lost interest in my m/cycle resto and Many other things, my son is moving out and im tired of feeling like the bad guy cos no one understands.I have been diagnosed with moderate depression... no meds,  yet the sadness, moodiness,paranoia, and feelings of social isolation and fear of losing every thing is overwhelming. I think that over the last couple of years things have got progresively harder to deal with and i have built up a resentment to the young men in my house who are living for nothing  dont have the understanding or care about the pressures or me, without sounding about ME im just so scared to deal with or face nearly anyone except my fiancee...i feel im a little out of controll and will try to work through this without meds,LIFE IS TOO SHORT, im gunna kick this black dog.Bye.

Often I would like to seek assistance with the problems associated with having too many bills, no money and trying to get by in life with this problem. I'm sure I am not the only person struggling financially due to work problems or health issues and was wondering if you could set up a forum that deals with the struggles of being broke and not coping with lack of money? I know there are places like CARE financial services and charities, but these folks don't want to talk about the emotional side of things, only the options [or lack of options] available and it'd be good to vent with others who understand the hardships.

I never did understand the ""staying in bed all day, unable to do anything issue"" but I do now! It seems to be all I want to do recently, that and cry, and feel really angry.
I'm starting to really hate my husband too so that isn't helping much. Now I am talking about wanting to leave him, he is telling me I have problems! I suggested that maybe if he took me away for a weekend instead of his beer drinking mates I might be a little happier with our relationship.
He hasn't worked for nearly two years, just living off his payout, sitting in front of the t.v. and the computer all day. I am out working, keeping the house clean, looking after the garden and trying to fire proof our 5 acre property. I ask for help with the house work and he tells me that vacuuming hurts his back and he doesn't know how to mop!
He told me off for buying $7.00 in postage stamps but he has just spent a week drinking and holidaying in Brisbane with some mates! 
Yesterday I was yelling and screaming abuse at a lady at a service station because she was buying up her groceries in the servo instead of paying for her fuel and moving her car first. I went into the servo yelling out like a lunatic as to who owned the car. I don't know what I would have done if it had been a huge biker looking dude! I probably still would have yelled abuse at him.
This depression is a cruel and brutal illness. I've certainly had enough. Where is the OFF BUTTON, the ESCAPE ROUTE and the way out of this LIVING HELL? I don't know any more!
I'm going to see my Dr again on Tuesday and dear hubby said he will come along as well. He thinks that pills are the only answer. That a tablet will fix everything. Medication does help, but so does TLC and a little attention form your husband. Why is he so damn blind to the fact that all I need is a little bit of his time and it will make a load of difference?
Now I am hating him. I feel it is too late for our marriage. To stay or go is the next big question! I don't have the answer to anything right now. It is all too difficult.
Mrs. Dools

It's very strange when you realise that you are actually really alone. You can be lucky enough to have friends and people and family around you, but really when it comes down to it, you are alone.  Maybe it is because I don't have children of my own. I think many people survive losing a partner , or separations because they have to keep going for their kids. I lost my husband to suicide. Lost my dad to cancer and now had a messy break up because I jumped in to needing a bloke too soon after being widowed. Stupid. I look back now and realise how stupid. But how vulnerable to doing it again. I am a bloody strong woman in so many ways, and so pathetic in others. I seriously am driving myself nuts. I chose not to have children. I am ok with that decision. But it does make me wonder what purpose I am on this earth for. Really, why am I here? I keep thinking I have something to offer, something to contribute to the world. Even braiding my nieces hair, and painting their nails is something worthwhile. Would anyone miss me if i was gone. Maybe for a few minutes, but, life would go on, and I too would be another blip in life. Friends say they will help, and they do the best they can. But when it comes down to it, it's all only up to me. To live or die. To get on with it or not. No one is going to come in here on a white horse and fix it all up for me. Gosh I wish they would. But basing that on my past history, they would be completely bonkers and ending up making my life worse. So why can't I just get up and get on with it? I am so disappointed with myself. Either get up and get on with it with confidence and vigour or give up. And even this self pitying drivel of my own is just not right, so many people are in terrible situations and much worse off than me. I didn't want to be my own pity party! beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all,I'm not sure what to say, I'm new here and I just need to get some things off my chest, events over the weekend have led me here. To start I have never been to a doctor regarding my mental health but i am sure that i suffer from depression and have done for most of my life. I was suicidal at a young age around 12 or 13 is my first memories of suicidal thoughts and a few attempts. I have been a severe alcoholic since i was about 16 and have been hospitalized on numerous occasions for alcohol related injuries and illness, most recently a severe head injury which is still giving me quite a lot of drama, with my memory, concentration and also is affecting my moods. I had stopped drinking in October last year but in November my long time girlfriend left me and since then I have had alot of trouble staying sober and have gone on several big benders all of which have resulted in either attempted suicides or trips to the er or the police station. Most recently on the weekend i fell off the wagon again and when i drink the dark side of me gets the better of me. After a rather viscous hangover i have decided I'm am going to seek professional help for both my drinking and for my mental health problems. I used to be avid skydiver and motocross rider but I have not ridden in along time due to being drunk 24/7 for the last 6 or 7 years. I always struggled to understand why i became a alcoholic and I now know that i was trying to block out the pain that i was feeling and I now understand that my alcoholism is directly caused by my feelings of depression and despair. final straw for my ex gf. I have been struggling without her as I am still very much in love with her and she still loves me a lot but she said she had to go because she didn't want to watch me die, and now she doesn't answer my calls or texts. I'm lost and I don't know what to do. I'm sorry for my spelling and grammar I found it very hard to write this and there are many things I have left out thanks for reading.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Help me, I have had depression for 13yrs, have taken an antidepressant for about the last 7 and the Friday (a week ago) I had a bit of a stressful day work related but forgot to take my medication, the next day I felt a bit off and took my tablet after work but started to have an anxiety attack then from then on I have felt yuck on and off ever since, I can eat without throwing up but don't have much of an appetite. Sometimes I'd feel ok but then get this warm rush through my body and start feeling sick again. Mornings I start feeling weak in the muscles and stuff and my heart feels like it's racing. Went to the doctor on the Wednesday and told me to try to have 1 n 1/2 tablets but don't feel much different and had 2 tablets this morning I had woken up at 2am and when I started at 5 I didn't feel too good had a 5min rest and finished my shift. Been on and off, not too good at the moment had a bit of a nap. I hear people start having a tolerance to anti depressants and no longer start to work. I feel they don't have much effect at the moment. The doctor told me to go back if im not getting any better but because of Christmas coming I don't think I can do it at the moment.also wondering if vitamin b tablets would help and ok to take with anti depressants?

To day is the day I'm dreading. Today is the day I stuff up my husbands life. Last year he was offered a job at our church and was going to become a youth pastor. Instead today they will be announcing to the church that he will be stepping back for 6 months. Why you ask? Because I spoilt everything by being depressed. I went to therapy before I got married started taking medication that I had a positive reaction to for quiet a while and wanted to be the healthy supportive wife that could do anything. Now I'm the wife that stuffs up everything. I'm the one that has stopped his dreams. I'm the one that has made him go to therapy because he does not know how to deal with me. I'm the reason people are talking. I'm the failure in the marriage. I'm the one that keeps him up 24-7 because he so scared of what I might do!  I'm the one with the issues but he's the one that has to suffer. And I feel so guilty about it. But I feel most guilty about is that I'm not going to sit beside him and support him at church today when the senior pastor announces this because I'm to ashamed and scared! I'm not a nice person and I think my darkest thoughts are really truebeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I'm new here and just wanted to tell my story.
I was diagnosed with depression in my late teens. I had difficulty maintaining any treatment regime and pretty much led a messy existence using illicit drugs, taking a lot of risks and bouncing from one disaster or job to another. In my mid twenties I met a girl and finally got help. The help was antidepressants which I feel have been holding me back from the brink for the past ten years, but for some reason I never had the strength to tackle my depression head on. I somehow managed to stay married and have a good job but all my energy went to hiding my illness from anyone but closest family, keeping my job and finding new excuses for sick leave and odd behaviour and not breaking down. My family were my only friends, I had no social life to speak of and I lived in constant fear and anxiety.
All of that was before my daughter was born. She has significant disabilities. Shortly after she was born (three years ago) three of my family members died in an accident. Since that time my anxiety and depression have gone into overdrive. I have kept working though, and drinking (a lot) more, and eating more and I am in a black hole, worse than when I wasn't taking AD's.

So it finally happened, I broke down at work. Had a total meltdown. I haven't been back for two weeks and I am having anxiety attacks every hour. I think I may have finally hit rock bottom and I don't see a way out. Doc has increased my meds and I am seeing a psych as regularly as I can afford...freaking out that it won't work.

I'm 49 and have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember. I have finally realised what my triggers are...my children who are 30,28,26 & 18. They all know about my depression but do nothing to help me. Instead they push my buttons, treat me badly and post nasty stuff on Facebook about me. I do not go on Facebook I hear this from other people. I've now come to conclusion that if I want to get better I have to cut ties with them to save myself. That's the hard part. Ant suggestions?

I've never talked about my battles with depression over the years to many people. I might have mentioned it once or twice, but this ongoing battle has been my own to deal with. I've done well in the past to recover and stay positive. It takes a reoccurring negative experience to bring me down to this place. I'm 23 now and I've worked hard to maintain my positivity. For a year now, my partner and I have had difficulties to overcome certain issues that negatively impact our relationship. We've tried counselling to steer us in the right direction but it hasn't helped. Lately, it has been too much for me to handle anymore. I feel like I have reached my point and I can't take crying, fighting, making up or apologies anymore. My heart is sore. As much as we love each other, it's not enough. There have been times when we've argued that I want to just hurt myself again and I wish for things to end. I told him that I think of hurting myself and that our relationship needs to change now because it brings me so much pain that I don't want to deal with it anymore. I told him about my thoughts and it just made me feel ashamed and embarrassed of myself. Is it right for me to feel this way? I feel like if you tell your partner about something like this, it should help you feel like youre not alone? I just want him to help me, to support me, and to push me in the right direction like I had for him when he was at his lowest point. Sometimes your run out of steam when you try to be strong... And this is where I am now. I'm tired or trying to get to the place I want to be but not being able to reach it. I just want to know what to do. I'm so lost and I feel so alone in my own home. I just want someone to fight for me like I matter.

Like most people here, I'm new and have no clue what I'm doing. I guess I just need to vent/ask. I've been struggling with what I believe to be anxiety, depression, and possibly schizophrenia. I have multiple medical issues that I'm not going to bother listing since there are so many. I don't want anyone to feel like I'm just seeking attention from all of this. I get so scared that people will get annoyed with me if I talk about and it, and I'm just scared of what they'll think. Ever since I was little, I have been slightly suicidal and went to a psychologist every Tuesday. I was in 4th grade and I didn't even really understand what I was feeling, I just had a really hard time with death. My grandma and dog died and for a youngster that's mind bending. Jump to present day and I've felt horrid, both physically and mentally. I just now admitted to myself a few days ago in the mirror of what I might have, which hurt me. I'd all ways thought I was true but I didn't want to believe it. Whenever I read sad things, it's like there is another me who pushes to the front of my head (she's all ways been there) and amplifies my emotions ten fold and brings forward thoughts of loss of faith in humanity and suicide. I've all ways been a pretty dramatic kid and I talk a lot and whine a lot and am really dramatic but only sometimes. When I'm in a social situation, I'm a shell. noone believes me when I say I'm shy. I feel like I have nothing to define myself. People say (especially family) that I act like my friends which sometimes annoys me off because it's not true or throws me into a pit of dispare because it is. I want to be normal so bad. I'm running out of room so I'llend it here, but there is so much and I'm sure you dint want to listen to a whining 15 year old.

I'm new here, this is my 1st post. I'm really isolated because of my issues and have been for 2 yrs since I gave up a long term addiction to drugs and cut ties with the ppl I used with. I've suffered from depression, anxiety and borderline personality disorder for yrs as well as ocd and anorexia. I thought that getting clean would solve all my problems and I'd b able to live a normal life, get a job ect and convinced myself that all my problems stemmed from drugs. So when I was hit with depression and anxiety and all the ocd thoughts slowly crept back in over the past few months and everything I worked for in recovery fell apart bit by bit as the mental illness took hold again I have been shattered by the realization that it wasn't the drugs causing mental illness but the mental illness causing me to feel the need to escape with drugs. Now I'm very concerned about my future, I can't stick to anything for long b4 I am stuck at home again, too anxious to go out. I don't think I'll ever hold down a job or live a meaningful life. Anyway I thought I'd try this website to reach out to others who might understand.  Aly.

I had mild depression years and years ago but came through it by changing my lifestyle and diet.  Recently I have had a really hard time with work, family life and financial commitments.  I am really struggling to make basic everyday decisions, I don't sleep and when I do I don't want to get up when I wake. I'm constantly negative and always turn a good thing into bad as that's what I expect to happen so I feel like I'm preparing myself for the worst all the time.  I am always hungry but when I eat I only want bad, fast food and after a few mouthfuls I tend to become nauscious and vomit!  I have started to shake a bit, I sweat like mad constantly and have had quite a few red spots appear on my chest.  I do not want to visit a doctor as it will show on my record and will jeopardise any future work prospects I want to do but it is getting quite scary as today I began to have suicidal thoughts.  I quickly talked myself round but it has scared me so much that I could even think this that I am now asking for help on here.  I have no idea what to do as I can not afford treatments or psychologists etc.any advice would be so gratefully received!!!

I want, nope, need to rant a little. I don't even know which category I fit in anymore but i'll post here in the depression section cause I guess that's where it all started and where it will probably all finish.

I was diagnosed with ""severe depression"" in high school at around the age of 14/15 since then I have been on all the usual anti-depression medications on and off till last year when i was told by a GP that I was misdiagnosed all those years ago ( I'm now 35 ) and what i actually have is Borderline Personality Disorder. I was also informed at that time that Anti-D's were not going to help what i need is constant psychotherapy. 

I've given up seeing doctors when i feel crappy because i expect the answer to always be the same - see a shrink. 
I really cant say that i have a horrible life situation. I'm not homeless, i have money, i have friends and i have a solid job. But no matter what, I always end up not being able to be satisfied. My situation at the moment is that:
I live away from my wife and kids ( 2 step and one my own )
The eldest stepson ( 17 ) moved up here to live with me
I moved away from all my friends to take this job ( which pays really well ) 

I ended up with a shoulder injury which required the use of over the counter pain killers ( containing codeine ). Now i seem to have developed an addiction to them that i cant seem to shake alone. I know its not even a serious drug like heroine, but for me the withdrawals are horrible and i keep giving in and getting back on them. 

Now i find myself once again, losing self esteem rapidly after repeated failures to shake the addiction all while dealing with the long distance relationship with my wife and the isolation of being without my friends. Before i left my home town, i was told by my shrink that this move was a really bad idea even if it fixes our money issues. I now believe her. 

I once wanted to be an advocate for beyond blue ( when i felt like i was beating the years of depression ) but now i find myself on the victim end of depression once again. I feel this wont be my last post here, its probably only just the start, but i needed to vent so maybe i can sleep now. 
Why is it that after 20 years I still cant shake depression when i feel like things are starting to work out.

Hi there,
 I have struggled with depression for most of my life. At the beginning of this year I seemed to have a grip on things and was doing pretty well but after a couple of months once I decided to stop taking my medication I fell into a dark and inescapable hole. I isolated myself and found it harder and harder to reach out to others. To this day I've tried three different types of medication and while i know it's not a cure, I'm still not feeling much improvement. I feel disconnected and barely like myself. I struggle to talk to others when I was once always sociable and optimistic. It feels like I am trapped and no matter what I do, nothing seems to make me feel better. In the new year I want to further my studies but even finding motivation is really difficult. It feels like I've completely lost myself and I don't know what to do. Please help :(

Hi all,So yesterday something within me snapped and I think I had some kind of breakdown. I work 2 jobs (I have to) and my girlfriend and parents have been pestering me to take a break for years. They don't understand that work = money and money = rent. I cant simply stop working for a week as then I won't have somewhere to live.Anyway, I think this pressure was really getting to me, alongside the constant work lifestyle I have to live. Then, on Wednesday night, my car broke down. I realised I would have to chose between paying to get the car fixed and my electricity bill and I just snapped. I got out of the car and just lost it. My vision blurred and nothing seemed to make sense. I found my self walking one way then 5 secs later walking in the opposite direction. I would get back in the car and try to start it only to leave it again, keys in the ignition. I felt like my brain was fading in and out of consciousness within my concious body. I rang my parents and girlfriend to sayI needed help and guess what they did? Lectured me about taking a break from work! That sent me into a blind rage of sorts. I managed to get home and sleep but the next day, yesterday, I was still really upset. My parents and GF started lecturing me: ""Take a break"", ""Buy a better car"" like I had all the money in the world. I would get incredibly angry at little things. I smashed my phone and laptop, which was incredibly stupid but I just lost control for a second. I would just pace the house endlessly. I feel a bit better today but still really mucky and not thinking clearly. What can I do???

Hello, so my name is luke, i'm 20.
I've never been an extrovert or enjoyed delvulge my own personal problems. mainly because of trust issues and well, its not something I really want to put on others. so i guess i'll cut to the chase.
I'm just really lost in life, it really all started when i was 16, my older brother ( one of two) had a car accident while i was on holiday with my family in england. he spent along time in hospital with brain injuries and its still an ongoing process. the day we flew back, we quickly moved from our old family home ( situated a couple hours from the hospital) to somewhere were we could be there for him. my school was quite good with it all and re enrolled me for the year later. as i did not want to be away from family and back in that environment, and by not coming back lost almost all childhood friends. ( small town talking). In the end i dropped out and got myself an apprenticeship, fully qualified now.
 a couple months ago my parents decided there marriage wasn't working, I'm living with my mother now, who needs the support, she needs someone to remind her on a bad day lives alright.. she hasn't worked for the last 25 years and the life change will be difficult. 
I've never dealt with emotional problems well at all, and i don't think i've ever worked through my problems. I've found myself with no friends, and the people that are in my life, i find cynical dark reason behind all there actions, in the end forcing them away, or just fading into the background. i've had problems with substance abuse since i was 15, and find self medicating has slowly made it all worse, downward spiral  that has no exit. A couple months ago i quit my job to focus on trying to sort the bigger problems in life out which worked well for the first month or so, really tried kicking bad habits and tried to enjoy my own company.I find myself alone and Recently money has become an extra worry as christmas and etc, but i had planned for all this previously, unforced problems with cars and etc through that out the door. 
these thing are just little problems and i know that but I hate life, theres no fun in life, and i'm so alone, i try to make friends but i can't even start basic conversation. I'm not even sure who i am anymore, the moods are so flat and negative in life. I'm angry and been known to blowup over nothing . This isn't the person i wanted to be.

Hi Everyone,
I'm a man in my mid-twenties and I've only just been diagnosed with depression. Actually, that's not strictly true, it was first suggested I might be depressed (melancholic depression) about 3 years ago but I was only on medication for a short time as it seemed to be related to another medical condition I was then suffering that had me confined to the house for about a year.
It's gotten to the point now where I've approached a psychologist and GP for help. This was prompted by months of trouble at work - not caused by bad working conditions but more by my difficulty coping. I first started noticing I was taking days of work simply because I couldn't bring myself to get out of bed. More recently, I've started noticing increasing anxiety in crowds (agoraphobia). This was the final straw that took me to the GP to get medication.
On a good day, I can manage to force myself out of bed to go for a walk; otherwise I'll procrastinate until the last minute and then trudge off to work, only to leave work as soon as I'm possibly able. I generally start to feel almost like a normal person around 7:30... and then because I need to go to bed early at around 9pm in order to get up at 5:30 to start the day, I get cranky because I only get about an hour of feeling human before I need to go to bed.

I hate going out to places where there are people, but at the same time I get bored staying at home. It's gotten to the point now that I don't even know what activities I actually enjoy. I feel like I've lost my identity. It's not like I'm not good at things; I'm great at my job and I'm well paid for it, I'm relatively fit and healthy as I force myself to go to the gym (which is easy because there's one at work). I'm at the point now that, with diagnosis, I'm ready to admit that my life over the past 15 or so years has been heavily influenced by depression and it's not just ""my personality"" or ""the way I am"". Knowing that doesn't help me feel like any less of a failure but hopefully, with anti-depressants and help from a psychologist, I can begin to make a difference in my own life and gain back the joy.

If I were to sum up my experience with depression simply it would be: I'm incapable of feeling excited and cannot remember the last time I did so.

I'm hoping that, by spending time on this forum, I can come to terms with my condition and gain confidence by being able to speak more about my experiences in a friendly understanding environment.

I wondered if anyone has been diagnosed with Dysthmia and can tell me anything about it. 
I have been wondering for some time now if I have depression. When I read the information about the different types (bipolar, major etc) I think no I'm not that bad. I'm not suicidal and I do look forward to things and get enjoyment out of a lot of everyday activities. I came across Dysthymia yesterday online and i think it fits. I know i should talk to my gp about it but i havent plucked up the courage yet. I do realise that self diagnosis is not a good idea but i thought i would look for some info here first before i go any further. 
 I seem to suffer with a chronic low mood. I'm not in the depths of despair, i just cant be happy a lot of the time and there is no apparent reason. I feel really tired a lot even though i get a full nights sleep. I snap at my husband a lot and get angry at him for no good reason. I find it hard to motivate myself at times and feel hopeless and completely drained. I just want to disappear sometimes. There are times when i feel like i'm just passing through this life not really living it. For a while i thought it was all down to hormones and time of the month certainly seems to have an effect on my moods but it doesnt explain everything. This has been going on for so long now that it feels like part of my personality and maybe this is just who i am- a moody person.  Exercise helps lift my mood but only temporarily. The past year has been stressful and the one ahead is looking to be quite stressful too and i think this is contributing to my current low mood. I dont have major highs and lows, I feel like maybe its chronic depression. 
Does anyone out there suffer with chronic depression and have any words of wisdom?

I have clinical, treatment-resistant depression. I find it very difficult to concentrate on work and am very, very tired most days. At a guess I would say I am only about 20% as efficient as I was when I was younger.
Of course, I have had countless tests, scans and doctors appointments to find out why I lack energy but it all comes back the same: major depression is the problem.
 I've never thought of myself as disabled - I work 12hr days (please, no one tell me that's the problem - I don't have a choice in this as I work so slowly I need the extra hours just to pay rent [I am paid per project]) and exercise and try to be a functioning human being, but slowly I am beginning to realise I will probably never be able to have a regular life.
I've had to endure watching my friends and peers succeed in studies, start amazing careers, own houses, etc whilst I plod along barely scraping by. This particularly is getting me a very, very, very down to the point where I have considered suicide.
I feel don't want to be the 'broke guy' of my friend group. I don't want anyone to pity me or think I am lazy and most off I don't want to be around to watch as these people lead fulfilling and adventurous lives - get married, have children, travel, etc.
So, what am I? Disabled? Lazy? Stupid? The reality is its got to be one of those things.

I don't know where to start my eyes hurt from all the crying. I hate having to rely on others but I have a driving phobia. I have depression. Dysthymia to be exact and my sister is pregnant with her second which is crazy as she trouble coping with her first. Anyway drove me and my kids to playgroup this morning and she always wants me ready on the dot. no waiting around at all. anyway she had to wait a few minutes and that annoyed her, I had 2 kids to organise and then and hour into playgroup her son screams and makes a big scene so she decides then and there that shes leaving leaving me no time to get things ready to go. She just says im leaving see ya. U see the reason her son was carrying on was that he saw my son outside which he shouldn't have been he asked me if he could and I said know then told the other carers I said yes which is a lie so he had to be brought back inside. That caused the problem and I tried to be as quick as I could to go I wasn't even aloud to even my coffee! and I was having a convo with one of the carers. So on the way home she says I need to respect when she leaves as Im going in her car and that she wont take me or my kids anywhere anymore. Then as I got out it was the first time I didn't say thank you for the ride and that got her angry again. I was just too upset to say thank you. This plus my dad having a go at me cos my house isn't clean atm because my son makes a mess. Im Just a mess atm and needed to vent

Hi everyone. This is my first post here. I'm not sure what is wrong with me, but all I know is that I am not right. I have had a couple of sessions with a counsellor who suggested I may have dysthymia but she wasn't able to diagnose it, in addition to that I saw her while I was feeling okay so it masked a lot of what I feel most times. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist next week regarding issues with controlling my moods. I have some of the symptoms of a personality disorder, whether or not the psych will agree in that, I just want some help.  I also have a persistent feeling of lowness, of unhappiness. I have never been a cheery, happy person and it's not something I can just snap out of. I just came back from an overseas holiday of a lifetime and I had some mental issues while on it, however I mostly felt content. However upon return I have hit a wall. I feel as if my life has no future, I have no friends, no prospects, my relationship with my boyfriend sucks. I find myself thinking about suicide, I don't think I would do it but just thinking about it seems to feel right. Basically, I feel as if I will never be happy, never have anything to be alive for, never have anyone. I look at my family and wonder when I will have what they have and realise maybe I'm just not meant to have anything. I don't see a future and I am tired of feeling so sad inside, I just want to feel happy and have a chance to be a normal person, and I wonder why my brain won't let me. I have no one in real life that I feel I can talk to about this so I guess I am desperate for a place to vent these feelings and wishes.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I just can't seem to get it right. The more I try to fix things the worse I seem to be making it. I can not think straight enough to talk logic . I am trying to build back the relationship I thought I had prior to needing to work so much that I forgot how to enjoy my life. Now my life has seemed to have moved on and I am lost. I don't want to keep trying . I feel like just giving up . I have no idea how to move forward and I don't think my family want me in their life anymore .beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Suffered from Depression and Anxiety since I was  a teenager. Sought help in my early 20s and was generally okay with a few minor ups and down for 20 years then 5 years ago a series of events happened which have set me back to where I was as a teenager. Major rejection from a very dear friend, my mum died of cancer and I'm left to look after my alcoholic depressive victim father who can do nothing for himself, he would spend all this money if someone didn't manage it - all this was left to me as my elder sister moved interstate 3 months before mum died and has basically forgotten about her family (another selfish person), my brother who is the only one living in the same state has nothing to do with my father as he wasn't a particularly nice father and my younger sister who is there for me but lives again interstate. So I feel a great sense on obligation to make sure my father is okay (goodness knows why). The main problem is he was okay for two years then he seems to be gradually returning to his old selfish victim self. I couldn't wait to get away from him at Christmas as we took him interstate with us to spend Christmas with my younger sister. I suffer from needing to feel liked, most probably due to rejection as a child. So I constantly seek reassurance which dives me mad. I feel like a square peg in a round hole most of the time. I am sick and tired of the ups and downs - negative thoughts come into my head and I try to examine them then get rid of them but its just so hard. Most of the time I feel so lonely it hurts and that no one understands or even cares as people are so wrapped up in their own lives no one even notices or asks......................

Hey out there.First time on the forum, so I thought a run down would be appropriate.I've been struggling depression, when I consider it, for most of my life and the entirety of my adulthood. At 27, having received on/off treatment for the past 12 years, hospitalised for suicidality on two occasions, last period I was untreated was over 5 years ago. I get bouts of suicidal ideation, have been juggled across half a dozen different meds, regularly see a Psychologist, and started with a new Psychiatrist as the one I'd originally managed to get a referral to retired that year. (After the kafka-like nonsense of getting referred.)  My reason for posting is basically to ask - ""How long do I have to try to get better before I can get to give up?"" I know this isn't a reasonable question to ask, but the only reason I've not been able to work up the courage to remove myself is the pain it will cause others who care. The fact they care is not a positive or motivational thing, just another responsibility and expectation I have to meet. ButI feel so exhausted in seeking treatment, never seeing any improvement, being expected to keep going, and struggling to be functional when all I want is for this pain in me to end, and I see no way of things improving in the world I live in now.   I don't have anything in my life that provides me satisfaction, and it seems the only times people aren't upset with me is when I live in service of someone elses needs, whether it's family, partner, work, housemates, but all that is to me is taking on more responsibilities they won't handle themselves, so of course people like it when their life gets easier. But I'm not allowed to expect that to come the other way.  From what I've seen, the posters here do look to be genuine people who understand this sort of feeling, would anyone be able to offer any advice, or a way forward I might not have considered?Thanks for taking the time, hope things are getting better for you.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all.  I' ve suffered from 'diagnosed' anxiety for the last 8 years. I say 'diagnosed' because I really don't understand where it came from. Lately i've felt that I'm simply not good enough for my family to go on. I have one child who is 16 years old and have not been able to have another child since. That is my first failure.....not being able to give my husband of 18 years another child. We declared bankruptcy 7 years ago and whilst we both have high paying jobs, our means became more than what we could maintain. Our friendship group consists of very wealthy people, of which we are now not so much. I feel we have been ripped off in life by not having what our friends have. We rent a house, because there is no way we could save for a deposit to buy our own home. My father was an alcoholic who passed away 6 years ago at the tender age of 55. I feel i am heading down the same track, just to cope with every day life.Life has slapped me in the face as a 38 year old adult, I am struggling to see a way out and simply wonder if my boys are better off without me......I've been drinking alcohol way too frequently simply to deal with my own demons. I am also a smoker, which my husband and son hate. I wonder if i continue to do that simply to shorten my life. Sorry if this sounds way too much, but my life basically feels like it is in a downward spiral and I'm simply at a crossroad right now...............beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I've had clinical depression for 14 years now - however lately my symptoms have changed and I am unable to control them as they are new to me & my previous techniques I have used.
I have gained 20kgs in the past year from compulsive and binge eating - I literally eat until I feel sick even though I hate how I look & want to lose weight.
And also lately I have become extremely angry - almost aggressive. I feel such a strong feeling of contempt and hatred towards others who in theory have done nothing wrong by me...
Please help and share if anyone else has gone through this...

Dear friends 
I've been quiet of late. One reason was going through all the Royal Commission stuff & another was I felt I didn't want to take people's time. I usually like to try & offer support but I'm sorry I haven't been great at that the past few weeks. Problem is I was kinda managing after the RC until this Friday when I woke up out of blue feeling the black dog had me trapped. I felt down, helpless, frustrated & guilty that I couldn't stop it. I've had a big pile of bills & paperwork which everyday I say I must do by tomorrow. Yet I get anxious & they don't get done. A few jobs I need to do but have this terrible immobilized feeling where I feel stuck, unable to do anything much. Why when I've been through this many times before can't I deal with it? Why am I so low & lost interest in most things. I feel like a loser. I had a plan to do something each day to improve my health as I'm very run down
 It was simple day 1 drink water as I usually hardly drink any, day 2 go for walk get out house, day 3 start cutting be mess I'm overusing. And I bought all this healthy food to make a soup etc & I've done nothing. I just feel so worn out that everything is a massive effort. I'll get a check next time I see Dr but if I didn't have depression I'd think something serious was wrong due to my extreme fatigue. I hate losing all motivation. I hate how this illness can just hit out of nowhere. I just want to function & hopefully experience a feeling of true happiness again one day. I really don't know what to do when I feel this low. Do I sit it out? Do I try achieve something each day as hard as it may be? After all this time I still don't know what to do when an episode hits. Its as though all my abilities get taken away. I don't want to feel this low. I've got a heap to go through with a lawyer over next 12 months to seek apology & compensation from the church. I just want to be reassured my strength hasn't gone. And when I feel like this things get really hard at home, my husband goes around saying he's sick of it & I feel so much guilt for an illness I'm struggling to control. What to do when it hits?? Anyway I'm sorry I haven't been my regular self with my replies. Lve Mares x

I have recently learned from my close friends that I had severe depression for about a year in 2011. I say recently learned because I was unaware of my depressive state. I thought I may have been depressed but had no idea to what extent
.I was 20 years old and living by myself in my mums house with her 3 dogs (she was living interstate) I didn't work and would live off $50 that she would give me every week. I lost about 10kgs and slept during the day and would go on Internet chat rooms at night time.  I thought all of my friends hated me and no one cared or knew that I was sad. 
I Found out this week that during this time my friends sought out councellors and made me food and made appointments for me to get help. They told me they came to my house on a daily basis and knocked on my door trying to get in so they could help. They brought me food that they would later find moldy and untouched and there was dog poo all through the house. They said I would come to the window and tell them to f#*! Off.
 This was all new news to me as I have absolutely NO memory of this happening. this is quite a shocking thing to find out about myself.  even hearing them tell me this brings back no memories of it. It's scared me quite a bit and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar to this??

So I find myself back here several years after I thought I was better. I don't know where to start and I don't really even know whats wrong. I'm scared for no reason and feel empty and alone even though I'm surrounded by family and friends. I've been living with depressin for 9 years and alway fear the dark days will return. For the last 4months I've been on a roller coaster. I go from amazing highs to such sad lows. Right now I'm locked in my room and too scared to talk to anyone. I feel no one understands me. I know I shouldn't be feeling so down which is why I find it hard. It's like I'm two people trapped In The one body. I'm not on medication at the moment. I feel so lost and confused. Don't know what to do. I feel I'm forever lost

Why is it that I am so fearful and ashamed to tell others what I experience? Depression is something I have struggled with all of my life. In the past 12 months it started to really spiral out of control again. Since then, even though I have dealt with it previously and told people about it previously I am so scared and anxious to share again and reach out for help.
 I mean I am not alone. My husband knows. He supports how he can. But I know he doesn't completely understand  I don't think he ever will  I don't hold this against him . But it's hard. I know I need further support
  I finally plucked the courage a few months ago to see a naturopath and explain my difficulties. I was scared to go to my GP first for the fear of medication and embarrassment. In the past she has been very cold when I've discussed this with her. Unsupportive and never followed up. A few months on and it seems the work of the naturopath is not working. I
 know I need to see a GP again. But I am so fearful. I think it may be best to change. But how do I choose who? The embarrassment. The shame. The anxiety. The courage. It all seems too much. and what if I do need medication? It seems I've exhusted every other option?

Hi everyone.
It's s been nearly a year since Ive posted on here, not that I haven't wanted too more often, It's just that I still find it very hard reaching out and only do so when I'm feeling very low, I have a question that I hope someone can help me with?
Due to my illness im not working at the moment, and for those that might judge, (no im not on any centerlink benefits either) I'm not ready to return to work really, I find it difficult to get up and do basic things let alone leave the house, but for financial reasons I may have to return to some type of work, I was wondering if there are any government departments, or services available to help people with mental illness find employment or at least find a employer who knows your situation and would be understanding of how it might take you time to adjust to things, kind of like how they get people into the workforce with disabilities.
I just know if I was somewhere where they knew a little about my situation and were understanding that it may take me a little time to learn and get into the work groove I would do better, it worries me greatly that I might just have to try and suck it up and do it on my own when I know I'm not ready.
Any advice would be welcome.
Troy

Hi there,
I am new to the online forums. 
I have anxiety, depression and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.
I would like to share my experiences of having mental illness as Im feeling alone and want someone to hear me.
I have been aware of my anxiety for about the past 4 years. I feel it may have been around before hand but hard to know when you engage in activities that alter your mind and behaviours. 
Anxiety hit me hard at my last workplace. I was bullied and overworked. The job itself was a stressful occupation.  I eventually found myself unable to function well at work and this is when I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. I sought professional help and after battling to go to work each day, I eventually resigned.  
My relationship of 10 years with my fiance was also under pressure.  I wasnt sure if I was in love with the person and they decided to end it as they felt happier on their own and not having to worry about me.  They also knew of my uncertainties so perhaps didnt want to risk investing themselves in a relationship which may not have had a future anyway.
Thankfully, my parents offered to accomodate me and support me financially in some ways.  I have slowly built up a network of support in my new community and have learnt tools which I can use to help me with feelings of anxiety,depression and intrusive thoughts.
 The thing that I'm struggling with most is the intrusive thoughts.  They can last for days, even months and cause a lot of anxiety for me.  I wish I could better manage these thoughts as they make me unhappy and can sometimes be too overpowering for me to battle. 
The Christmas period has been difficult for me as some of my usual support network is not available.  My partner used to encourage and support me a lot and remind me of my strengths.  I miss that kind of support and I feel he was my cheer squad.I feel like not many people just 'listen'. 
Its now been about 4 years of therapy for me with different professionals and spiritual work in the years before that.  I feel as though I work so hard on myself and I want recognitiion for that.  Perhaps I need to start being my own cheer squad...
On the rare day I will feel connected with life, which makes me most happy.  Everyday I feel anxious for most of the day, with my anxiety going up and down.  I also experience periods of depression. 
Ideally, I would like to come off my meds, and be a more confident and happier person.
Thank you.

Makkah 67I have ticked all the boxes and now find i am suffering severe depression as well as anxiety and have no idea of what to do or who to talk to apart from my GP. i have often thought of commiting suicide. My worst problem is my mind, is continually spinning like a top and wont let me concentrate on any subject for more than a minute or less ( even now ) i have to force myself back to the subject. I am continually talking to myself even going as far as having a conversation with myself, and no i am not talking out loud only in my own mind. I live alone and only have a younger sister who has her own family to care for and her own life to live and certainly does'nt need an elder brother slowly going nuts to worry about, she also has her elderly father to look after. Is there somebody out there who lives their lives in a similar manner, if there is could they and would they be able to offer any suggestions and advice.Makkahbeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

After being in an emotionally abusive relationship for a year, coming out of it, I realize I have been broken down a lot more than I though. With a new boyfriend now, he has helped me take steps towards getting help. As it's that awkward time of year where my usual help is unavailable, I have found myself feeling anxiety, exhausted , crap sleep and scared. My head feels clouded and I just can't get my feelings and emotions straight. Today both my parents and my boyfriend that in the past few days, something has changed but I can't pick what it is myself. 
Not much information to work with sorry, I'm new to this. I just want to know what it is I can do to get my head back on track, atleast until next week.

I have had to deal with this ever since I can remember. There are periods when it's not so bad, but it always there. I've reached a point now where I can't take it anymore, don't want to feel anymore. Things won't get better for me. I have a supportive family, I have everything I've ever wanted, I have friends, it's just not enough. I'm empty , I just don't see a point of continuing but I couldn't never take my own life, I could never do that to my family. So I'm just trapped feeling like this, having to live so miserably , it hurts so much. I have so many people I could reach out to, but what's the point, they can't fix the way it hurts inside. My stomach is in knots because I know I can't fix this.

Hi all,
 Not sure how far I will get in this post. I have been needing to reach out to someone/something for a while now but haven't been able to. While I have known that BeyondBlue is always there, I feel immense fear in connecting with the community.
 A quick back history: 27yo female, living in WA, been battling mental health (with a few different diagnosis) for the best part of 10 years (first official diagnosis was early 2005), I completed my teaching degree and then post grad in special needs education, I have now left teaching as the uncertainty of a job, nature, hours and stress of the job were too much for me and didn't match the my personality (aside from the mental health). The last two years I have had various casual contracts in jobs that I wasn't happy in, with a manager who was a pain & hours that sucked. Currently unemployed, which is a massive issue right now. Have a very supportive network but that just don't ""get"" it.
 Okay, so that wasn't so brief...I tend to talk a lot and just trying to let myself ramble and reach out here...the hardest step will be hitting ""post this thread"".
 Now: I can't afford to see a counsellor, I'm living on bare minimum as it is. I have tried finding/asking about a free counsellor, so far with no luck. I feel myself spiraling backwards - the negative self-talk, attacking and analysing anything I may have said or done, the complete lack of self-worth. Without sounding up myself, I feel that my intelligence and understanding of everything that is happening to me is my downfall. I can't really explain that right now but it is certainly putting the tears on my face, which tells me that it is a big issue/concern. I feel like I'm too ""functioning"" to receive help. Everyone sees the functioning side but noone sees what happens underneath that to get to that part. I spend my days fighting and arguing with myself. I don't know what is good for me to do, what is too much. I have lost all sense of trust in myself. And, then my tolerance levels are so low...I feel for my boyfriend. He copes all the mood swings and irrationality and it isn't fair.
Sorry all for the rambling :-) I have tears streaming down my face but am feeling a sense of relief that I have been able to write this down, and that hopefully someone might read it and ""get it"".
I do have a great GP (but I'm wondering after 10 years whether I need to try someone else's approach). I am on meds - not sure they are working.

Hi, today I decided to sign up to Beyond Blue to reach out for help and advice for myself. I' m lost, frustrated and majorly lacking motivation. I'm approaching the one year mark of being off work (covered by income protection for both physical and mental health issues). Whilst I have tackled some of my physical health issues, this mental battle isn't so easily fixed. I'm sad to say that I am probably mentally worse now than I was a year ago. I have a very supportive partner who I couldn't fault, and for that I am extremely grateful, but I worry that he may enable me to succomb to every little negative feeling I experience. I feel like I needed the past year to deal with my health issues rather than continuing to soldier on whilst struggling and not meeting the expectations of my employer or keep a household together, but now, a year later, I am spending my days in bed and sleeping around 18 hours of the day. I will not leave my room as I do not wish to socialise with my flatmates. In the evenings my partner comes home from work and arranges dinner. When he goes to sleep I lie there half awake waiting for my pain medication to kick in (I have recurring migraines and strong prescription pain killers for this) which in turn makes me drowsy and sends me to sleep again. I will generally wake up around 11am the following day and immediately try to fall asleep again. Getting out of bed just seems so overwhelming. My bedroom is a mess and it haunts me, I see it as a reminder that I don't have my life together and I feel guilty for the way I am living. I don' t want to live like this anymore but I have no idea how to help myself. I have read some information online but putting anything into action feels impossible and daunting. I would much appreciate any advice you might have. Thank you (P.S - I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and Depression and am on medication for this which I don't feel is working. My GP has advised that it will take a number of months to feel the full effect and has a plan for me to see a psychologist in the new year. I worry that I won't even be able to leave the house to attend these appointments).

Hi All,
I'm hoping to get some support and advice here as I don't know how much more I can take, of myself or my circumstances. I have suffered with depression for many years but the last couple of years I have hit rock bottom again and again. I have read a few posts on here but really haven't found much I can connect with or relate to as I feel like I haven't had anything to be happy about for some time now. 
Three years ago I ended up in a psych ward with a really bad depressive episode after breaking up with my partner of 11 years who I have 2 lovely children to. I was prescribed antidepressants and started to claw my way out of the hole. Spent some time in crisis accommodation and slowly got myself back into work and started making a life and things were looking up. 6 months later I started the slide downwards again and haven't been able to pick myself up. I lost my job but managed to be positive enough to find another within 3 days. around the same time I met a girl who I really hit it off with and ended up relocating a few hours away to be with her even though I let my depression get to me again and lost my job again.
since then everything has gone from bad to worse. Long story short but it turns out my new girlfriend seems to have BPD and as soon as I moved in with her she started abusing me. She gets into rages telling me I am faking depression, using her, A burden on her, that im a terrible father, cheater - everything under the sun. She has kicked me out of the house many times, leaving me to fend for myself on the streets for days at a time before saying sorry and asking me back. I feel stupid but so many times I came back hoping things will get better.
A few months ago things I had gotten so stressed and depressed and anxious that I ended up getting admitted to hospital again and trying to get help. they started me on new antidepressants which I don't really think are working and stupidly I came back to my girlfriend afterwards. I have gotten so bad I just loathe myself for my weakness for coming back here, it just adds to the self-hate I have. I don't have anything at all other than my clothes and a few small items. I haven't answered calls from any of my very few friends and have just shut everyone out. Christmas is coming and I have no money, no job, a relationship that is toxic and just feel like I am all alone and helpless.
I really don't know where to turn to any more.

Dear all, dear friends
This post could be placed on 3-4 other forum headings, but I've decided to lodge it here.  Mainly cause of the overwhelming sense of horrible depression that I've got on board with me at this time.
I'm numb, I'm empty, I'm gutted and everything is just moving along like a blur.
Dear friends, one week ago (Tuesday night), I lost my Mum - she fought a long long fight with cancer, but the mongrel disease took her in the end.  The reason you haven't had me on Beyond Blue for some time now is that I've been back in my home town with Mum and then the last week, well, you can imagine.
Yesterday was her funeral - and it was a lovely service.
A year ago Mum wrote her own eulogy and it was her wish that I read it out.  Which I did.   I also created my own eulogy of my personal memories of Mum and read that as well.  I stumbled on a few occasions, but I had my daugther up front with me, and she held my arm, to keep me going.  I did the same thing for my Dad (7 years ago) and it was something that I knew I had to do for Mum as well.  I must have done ok, because many people commented to me or my brother afterwards about the eulogies and how good they were.
I've been away from ""home"" now for coming up to 30 years - as I commented in part of my eulogy - and that during that time, I would have phoned the family phone number thousands and thousands of times.  But now, the house is empty and I won't be phoning that number ever again.
As I also said in my eulogy, I don't know how I'm going to go in the future - certainly not forward - it might just a case of sideways for a while.
So I now have both my parent's no longer here (as well as a very close brother) - my dad's and brother's deaths devastated me and now my Mum (I was a mummy's boy as well).
I'm going to miss her so much.
Neil
ps:  I may post occasionally in the coming days - but they may be few and far between at this stage.  I won't be going away, but I just have nothing inside to offer.

Hi Guys
I use an iPhone app called ""My Wonderful Days"", where I can list good things that happened during the day. I have found that using this app, has helped me to stay in a positive mind frame. 
Hope this helps someone else, like it has helped me.

A couple of days ago I was able to identify that I was building up to an emotional meltdown. I noticed the signs (feeling something bad was going to happen, anxious thinking, unable to concentrate, out of body feeling, on edge) and despite my attempts to prevent it the following day I feel full-blown into it. Inconsolable tears, anger, guilt, hopelessness). And then today, I'm back to feel ok and normal.
This has been happening every couple of months for the last year or so. Each time it has happened previously I've thought that it was the last one and that it was just an instance that wouldn't happen again. Its only now that I have noticed the recurrence of it all.
 I'm not being treated for anything as outside of these episodes I'm usually pretty OK and well functioning. But I do suspect there could be some sort of mild depression lurking as I do feel different to what I felt say two-three years ago or before I went through quite an emotional trauma. Is there something quite serious happening with me that maybe I do need to get addressed medically??
Sorry if I'm sounding a bit all over the place.

Hi all, been a while... Thought I was doing well then became sick and it's like it's undone all my hard work on my mental health. Currently seeing doctors/specialists to figure out what's wrong but the not knowing is making me anxious and depressed (along with not feeling well).
 So anyway, yesterday when I was feeling particularly ill, my husband was ""bored"" so decided to go out for a while. When he eventually got home, he was acting strange and I was feeling sick and emotional and basically had a meltdown - could not stop crying. He was very unsympathetic and trying to pick fights with me about other things. Later I asked him if he'd been drinking and he said no.
 Well I'm not an idiot, and suspected he'd been drinking when out earlier that day. So I looked through his phone and let's just say it became apparent he had spent a couple of hours at the pub. I'm so angry he lied to me,decided  to go out when I was sick, then shows me no support or sympathy when I had my meltdown. I don't know whether to confront him about it now or after Christmas (bearing in mind we will be travelling in a few days and spending 6 hours in the car together). 
 
Thoughts please.

so I am back at home now after being in perth clinic for 15 days. I figured out pretty early on that I was better off just telling the nurses & my doctor that I agreed with everything the doctor said and to just hide from everyone what i was really thinking and feeling. my husband did ask one of the nurses early in my stay about getting a second opinion but she said it would be next to impossible to do while i was a patient admitted by my current psych and she insisted to him that it wasnt necessary and that I just needed to change my personality problem which is the opinion of the psych. anyhow after this nurse told me ""its easy just decide to change"" and said ""stop being negative"" when she found me crying in my room and my doctor laughed about me being  grumpy thats when I decided i was done with being honest with anyone there.
now i am back home and my husband wants me to tell my gp about all of this and ask him for a referral for another psych but I dont know if I can do all that. I just feel like i dont want to open up to anyone else as i dont like how it makes me feel when Im invalidated.
i dont know what to do

Hello everyone,
I
can not seem to escape my own negative view of myself, everything I do and what
I think others think of me I tend to see the negative. I am doing my PhD, its
taking a long time to get here (I am 10 years older than the average Phd
Student). I have been having problems of confidence and I feel bad all the
time. I have tried working through it but I am not succeeding at it. I
seem to be constantly worrying/ruminating with my negative thoughts.I don't
feel like I was good enough, I had to give a seminar for my work, I feel it did
not go well. I am struggling to find anything enjoyable again.I want to please
my supervisor/friend. I highly respect them, a lot of my self worth is tied up
in their approval. What the hell do I do? How do I stop my brain from trying to sabotage me? Why does it feel like some part of mine is trying to ruin me??

Let me start by saying i've had depression since I was about 12, it started with bullying and turned into something very different over the past 6 years. In that time I've been on antidepressants but stopped taking them after a year as i felt ""normal"" again. There have been darker times and easier times but all the while I have put in effort to see someone, go for a walk, take my mind off things.. etc. In the past year I have gained 20kg. I eat a lot of unhealthy foods and will often decide to take ""me days"" in which i will stay inside my room and eat junk. I have trouble controlling my appetite and despite not being happy with my appearance, have stayed fairly positive as far as my body image goes..(to an extent). In the past 5 months however its gotten worse. Every day has become a ""me-day"".. I've lost my friends, confidence, and my boyfriend of 2 years is no longer attracted to me. Although he stays, he wants to see me fight my depression like i always have. But I can't. I'm exhausted of trying to fight to get better. Until coming on this website I refused to speak to anyone including him and my family about how I feel. I can't fight the same problems anymore. I'm already overweight and i have no motivation to get up and try to put my life together. So i sit inside my room and complain that I'm ""too exhausted"" when in reality i do nothing with my life. This has been a hard couple of months. I want to make things better. But i need help getting my drive back. Where do i start?

I haven't always been like this. I used to be so active and enjoyed life. These days I struggle to get out of bed and when I finally do I feel like a brick is holding me down. I push myself to have a shower and then push myself to do things. I often find myself sitting on the couch wasting the day away. I lack so much confidence and stress about the smallest task. If I could I would spend all day in bed.
I have been reading lots of posts on here trying to get some strategies in place but I am so unmotivated. I guess I am hoping that some of you might have some ideas. I used to work full time but over dd it and had a break down. I now have a few hours of part time work with my sister. I have to push myself to get to work and stress about the smallest things. I have put on a lot of weight which is depressing in itself but lack the motivation to do anything about it. I do see a psychiatrist but I am thinking that maybe I need to see a psychologist for some counseling.
I am hoping that I can start a thread that will enable me to tell my story. Looking forward to hearing from others and hearing how they break the chain. Some days I just don't want to push myself anymore but I know that I can't live like this forever. I want my old self back. The one that was willing to give anything a try and enjoyed life.

It's bad enough having a naturally ugly face, but I also have an allergy to alcohol. Drinking is such a strong part of Australian culture, and I can't drink. When I'm alone I'm always dreaming about a relationship with the unrealistic dream girl inside my own head. I used to only think about this when I was alone or on public transport, but now sometimes I catch myself daydreaming when I'm with a group of friends. Every time reality comes crashing down and I remember my appearance. And I think about the interactions I make with people all the time. And the past and the present and the future, I can't stop thinking about it. Hypothetical conversations with others, with myself, with therapists, self diagnosis... It's like a really dark Charlie Kaufman movie where my only relief is sleep. I would sleep all the time if I could. I'm 23.
Sorry for the lack of proper formatting, just sort of threw it all together...
If someone could point me in the right direction it'd be appreciated. Thanks.

Hi
I just wanted some advice on the following matter. From the past few months I am feeling pretty  empty from inside. Not that I am crying or unable to laugh or something. Everything is normal but it is just that When I talk to someone there are two people within me.
I talk to people in a childish way, laugh on stupid things and then there is another part of me thinking all the mature things etc. I was not like this before.. also I am having sleepless nights.
can it be because I am in between the process of giving exams for higher education and stuff? Though it doesn't tense me too much, but yes a thought of what will happen next is always present in my mind.

Bipolar Definition: When the person struggling with it is trying to stay focused and productive and positive. Stress and fatigue. When the world around you is moving so fast and efficiently that it is like a blur to you. Please never look at someone with this condition and think for a moment that they can 100% control it. That they are just being pathetic.Our minds are wired differently. We see things on a deeper more emotional level than most. We take the suffering of others more personally. That is why we are so creative.Sometimes it just grabs us and shakes us up. We cant function effectively, but seem to only be existing. We find it hard to laugh and smile when all we want to do is cry. But it balances itself out with times of extreme efficiency, productivity, creativity and joy.It passes, but understand, it is also a painful truth to this condition. This is my life. Extremes, either really happy or really sad. I am not a quitter, I am not sponging off my mental illness. I spend alot of energy and time trying to control it, with much success over the years, but then out of blue, I get a big one that I cant control.This is my life. I am sure you know someone else with the same condition. They need your support, not your condemnation.Merry Christmas

Last week I officially completed my studies with top grades  and completed  the hours of work experience I needed to graduate I am currently now trying to peruse my dreams I have had before I started my studies. Looking at my position in life many will say I have my whole life ahead of me and I should be happy celebrating and on top of the world.
Instead of celebrating the first weekday after I officially finished my studies I ended up in my GP, s Office as just when I could see my symptoms was starting to improve I could notice my symptoms was starting to get a lot worse, my GP ended up increasing my AD, and I need to go back next week for a safety check.
I thought once I finished my studies I will have less stress in my life therefore my symptoms will improve but I found it to be the complete opposite, I wish that this depressive episode will just end.
 Although I  am having a hard time at the moment I decided I am not giving up a wise psychologist told me this week just because I am having a bit of a relapse don’t be too hard on  myself and don’t give up that does not mean my coping skills is not working. 
So I guess I just have to keep working on my coping skills and try to look at the bright side of life until the day comes that I see the light at the end of the Tunnel
Thanks for Listening

hi there  just wanting some advice.
In January I stopped taking my anti depressants, due to not having a job and couldn't afford the script. I think I've felt fine since I stopped them, lost 10kg even! (without exercise, just from stopping the tablets)  However, lately I've been feeling so very unmotivated to do anything at all. I'm not sure if it's laziness or depression. My husband and I are moving interstate in 3 weeks, and seriously I cant get the motivation to do any of the cleaning that needs to be done, let alone the rest of the packing. We're visiting family for a week around xmas, so we've only got 2 weeks to finish it all. 
 I've been feeling pretty stressed about the move, we're moving because there's no work here for me, (my husband is on disability pension) and when we get to QLD, we're staying with my mum, until we can find a place to rent. Once we find a place to rent, we have to buy things to get us through, as we can't afford to get removalists to deliver our stuff. (it's going to be in storage in SA)  I just want to lay in bed and forget the world! I've even stopped contacting friends (via text/phone -  as I know no one here),  I just don't have the energy. I sleep till lunch time, can't get to sleep till early hours of the morning usually.  
Depression? or just lazy

I was first diagnosed withchronic moderate depression 8 years ago and I've since been diagnosed with PTSD. I had a rough childhood. I don't find it too difficult to make new friends, enter new jobs and take new  opportunities , however, as my depression returns every 1&1/2 to 2 years, I manage to destroy every opportunities that comes to me. I've been told that I'm happy, bubbly and charismatic and because of this I  generally  do well in my studies/work/friendship, until depression strikes. When the black dog comes for me I isolate myself in my room, ignore my friends, and smoke alot of pot .  My character changes completely. Eventually the things I've spent the last couple of years on building up, crumble again. I've lost a degree, all of my savings, a job, a couple of relationships, family members, and alot of friendships from my depression, and I know it will happen again and again. I just stop caring about anything. I don't have the energy to care. If I recover from this time, then what? Do I build up my life again, knowing that I'll stuff everything up again in a couple of years? I know that this depression is for life, and it will always be back. I feel like everything I do in do in day to day life is superficial. It is hard to find a point to anything. I also have a very grim view on the world. Sometimes when I smoke too much pot I have psychotic episodes and think my house mates have poisoned me.  I know that this is a delusion and it scares me when I lose control of my senses. My Dr thinks these episodes have something to do with the PTSD. I'd hate myself if I could summon up the energy. I can't keep anything together.

I’ve always struggled with anxiety throughout my life. About two weeks ago I got into a really bad cycle of anxiety, (probably the worst I’ve experienced to date) and when I finally got out of it after about a week, I felt strange - kind of empty and flat.

My emotions seemed blunted, my sense of humor dulled. This was obviously bothersome, and stimulated my anxiety. I began to worry if I was depressed. I was sleeping a lot, not too interested in my usual hobbies, and feeling disconnected from some of my friends. Over the next week, I felt the same general way. However, a few times, I’ve managed to “snap out of it”, usually when I would reason with myself enough to convince me I’m fine. One particular night, after one of these realizations, I felt perfectly back to normal - great mood, sense of humor back. I felt truly normal. 


However, the next day, I found myself slipping back into the feeling of the disinterested rut. This past semester, my two best friends went to Europe to study aboard, and my girlfriend left for Florida (1,000 miles away) to do the Disney College Program. I love my roommate but he’s rarely ever home. As a result, I spend a lot of time by myself, not really doing all that much. There’s not a lot to do on campus and I don’t have a heavy courseload. I can’t figure out if these moods are caused by genuine depression, or if I’m getting bored and lonely, and my anxiety is grasping on to this, bringing me down further, creating this weird rut. When I’m in big groups or in a fun social setting I can sometimes “let go” and enjoy myself, but when I’m alone, the more I think, the worse I feel - once I’m down like this, it’s hard to get out of it. Do I have reason to be concerned that I’m actually suffering from depression, or am I letting my anxiety make me over analyze my feelings and perpetuate a bad mood that would have otherwise passed? 
Thanks for any help.

Well my son took my phone while I was still asleep early this morning to play games and when I got up to find it it was lost and neither of us new where it was. I kept asking where was the last place u had it etc and he couldn't remember but then I prayed and prayed then found it behind a cushion near my laptop as my son said he left it near my computer. It was dead of course as I asked many friends to try ringing it. But its on charge now and im so happy its been found as I was soo depressed for a while when it was missing that I actually started crying. Even though ive found my phone im still in a state of shock and depression which im finding it hard to come out of. Ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety anyways. Any suggestions to lift my spirits would be great :)

Hi everyone
I guess the title says it all really.. I am a 28 year old female and the relationship with my therapist has gotten to the point where it is probably inappropriate but then I am not to sure and I also have very strong feelings for her.
I have been seeing this woman for about 10 months and have shared some very personal information with her during our sessions and she has been a huge pillar of support for me and I noticed I began feeling excited to see her and felt some feelings towards her about 3 months in, I immediately took control of the situation and made sure I was aware of my feelings and reassured myself it is normal and will pass I also took steps to lessen appointment times and sessions. 
Over the past 3 months she has begun telling me that she gets butterflies when she thinks about seeing me and she ""Loves how excited she gets when she sees me"" I know everything about her life because she has told me everything, and we have started seeing each other outside of therapy a few times catching up for lunch. 
Yesterday we met up again this time for breakfast and she was constantly touching my hands and my back and when I went to say bye and leave she hugged me tightly and kissed me on the cheek.
I am beyond confused I get a huge sense that this woman has strong feelings for me, but it is wrong on so many levels... She is my therapist and also a female (I have never had feelings for a woman before) I am so concerned fir her and her job but at the same time I am falling in love with her to the point of literally feeling my heart flutter and all that other romantic stuff lol when she is around..
 
What do I do? Am I even right for thinking she has feelings for me? And should I cut all contact to protect us both... I am so confused :(
 
Thankyou so much for reading my post and I hope it makes sense :)

Please help..
Im 29 years old and have been a very positive, confident happy person my entire life until 6 months ago when i had a breakdown. 
Ive got a terminaly ill mum who has been battling cancer for 20 years. She is my best friend and has been my rock my whole life. She is one of the most strong minded and positive humans alive. 
Ive always been a hard worker and so focused on my career however been made redundant twice in the last 2 years which has been a kick in the guts. 
Ive been in a relationship with my husband for the past 4 years and we have been married 12 months.
 I think my breakdown has been a build up of things over the many years that as boiled over. Initially i blamed it all on my husband saying i was not happy in our marriage 
 The last 6 months have been aweful. Ive been so sad nearly every day.. unmotivated to do anything and just simply dont care. Ive had a constant thought in my head that i dont love my husband anymore and should leave. There are no red flags with my husband. He is amaxing, caring, kind, supportive and will do anything for me. We have just found out we are 10wks pregnate. Ive always wanted kids and a family i just didnt expect  to be feeling so confused and scared about life and our future. I dont feel connected to the baby at all and dont know even if i should be having it feeling like this. 
Ive been getting counselling and seen a team at the hospital that have suggested meds. I have not got the script filled yet. They said i tick all boxes for clinical depression. 
 Im not happy in myself and i hate it. My smile and personslity use to light up a room and now im so disconnected from myself i dont know who i am. 
Any support/ advice would b greatly appreciated.

The section for posting re bipolar has disappeared so I am back in this forum.have been struggling badly with the depressive side of my bipolar2 recently. Had a video link session with my counsellor yesterday who suggested I call my psychiatrist for a discussion re possibly adjusting my medication dose. Called his rooms  but no he cant discuss it with me on the phone I have to go in. I live 1500km from perth, its not that easy to just drop in. So I called PATS to find out if I would be eligible for assistance for the airfare, (which thank god I am  ) they just need a letter from the doctors office confirming my appointment. Had to beg with the doctors receptionist to email me that then I had to forward it to PATS with a request for what flight I want them to book me on...Ive managed so far to do it all but far out, when all you want is for the world to end having to deal with this bureaucratic stuff is just a nightmare.. I was in tears on the phone and the receptionist at the psychs office just said ""we cant help you till you come to perth. Call us back when you know when that will be"" and hung up on me so Im really enthused about going in there on monday... and the books my psych told me to get I cant even understand what they on about so thats gonna go over real well when he finds out I havent done them. He is big on the whole noone can help me if Im not helping myself thing and Im pretty sure failing to do the workbooks will be considered me not helping myself...so over it. Wanted to hurt myself this morning but Im too gutless to go through with it.my hubby came home from work when I told him that but I wish he would go back cos he is not actually speaking to me and I had to cry and beg just to get a cuddle which made me feel pathetic.

Is this a horrific way to be feeling?I am a NIDA graduate come Barrister with Bipolar-II, severe insomnia (2hrs sleep at most per 24hr block), and schizophrenia (visual and smell, not auditory). Because of a breakdown I had four years ago I rapidly became too scared to socialise (social anxiety) and have since become agoraphobic. I've just started treatment this year, having a psychologist and psychiatrist do home visits; it's amazing how extremely difficult it is for people with agoraphobia to get any medical care, especially GP care, that will come to the home.I've started CBT with the psychologist but my psychiatrist, doesn't seem all that switched on. He's put me on a mood stabiliser and anti-depressant for the BP-II, ignores my concerns over the insomnia, and after having a bad reaction after switching anti-depressant meds, he's told me to just stop everything, focus on the CBT, and ride it out until he can see me next in Feb '15.  I guess this suits me. I miss the mania, I truly do. Taking the medications made me feel unfathomably bored; I don't feel like myself - I lost my sense of me. I've lost interest in everything I once had a passion for, I can no longer write creatively, I'm no longer quick witted... Absolutely nothing interests me; as an agoraphobic, that's not exactly a good thing since I'm very limited in regards to accessible stimuli. I'm a pretty flamboyant kind of guy, larger than life usually, very theatrically inclined; now I lack the energy to do anything - I'm pushing myself to write this. To me thedark, surging, spiralling void of depression seems to be worth the bouts of mania. So... Am I the only one who feels this way, and is it wrong to feel like this?

For the past year I have been getting better. Understanding why I get overwhelmed by life and learning to cope in a very difficult situation. The priest in my church has bullied me unmercifully for several years because I stood up for what I thought was right.
I spoke to him yesterday about a matter and he told me I was not fit to be a leader in the church, that I was disloyal, presumably because I did not agree with him, and a bad influence in the church.  I know there are some people who agree with him, mainly I suspect because they have never heard my side of the story and it is difficult attending this church. I have decided not to leave because I see no reason for being pushed out, but he is now leaving and will be gone on Monday.
I really did not expect this parting shot and I collapsed completely yesterday. Even writing this makes me cry. What really upsets me is that it is the church doing this. It is the one institution that I have looked up to believing it has good spiritual practices, love and compassion. So this has opened my eyes in a most unpleasant way and hence I suppose my depression. Silly me for having faith in people. 
I was really getting well again and feeling happy. My brain had 'unfogged' and I was thinking more clearly, had more energy and was begining to manage my life again. Then this happened. I don't understand why or how people can be so vicious or why I am so thoroughly intimidated, nervous and shaky. You would think I could have toughened up by now. Instead, here I am shaking all over, crying like a baby and wishing I had never been born.
In a few days it may all get better again but until then I feel as though I am in a huge void, tossed around by any wind, not knowing which way is up. My whole body aches, inside and out So many people how much it helps to write down their feelings and i am finding that too. But I still do not understand why I fell down so hard and so quickly. I really thought I could handle this sort of stuff.

Hi All,Firstly, I apologise if this seems jumbled, but this is harder to write than I first thought.I' ve been battling depression, low self- esteem and a lack of confidence for about 6 years now. I've seen many doctors and been prescribed many different medications.I generally have an upbeat disposition but I guess that comes from being able to hide my feelings very well, but there are times where it all hits me like a tonne of bricks.Despite the medication I still find myself in deep bouts of depression and self-loathing regularly, with sporadic thoughts of self destructive behaviour thrown in to boot and recently I've been feeling extremely lonely and isolated. I believe one large key factor is that a have a tendency to over think things way too much.I haven't had a relationship or sexual partner for nearly 6 years and I believe this is due to the way my medication kills my sex drive and libido along with my lack of confidence. To make matters worse, I'm currently living with a female friend whom I previously had quite strong feelings for. She is currently in a committed relationship with another of my friends who also lives with us and over the time we have spent living together, I think these feelings have grown even stronger, to a point of almost infatuation.I want to break the stranglehold these feelings for her have over me, but I can't seem to. I've tried to meet other women, but I end up comparing them to her and let my self-esteem and confidence issues get in the way.I'm not looking for a silver bullet, because I know I've got a long way to go, but I don't know anywhere else to go.

I thought sharing my story might help get some feelings out of my head and hopefully hearing other peoples recovery story can give me some hope.Looking back I believe my depression started at around 13. My teenage years were extremely destructive with heavy drug and alcohol use as well as sexual promiscuity and binge eating.I first tried antidepressants at 16 and decided they were crap after a month.At 20 after a very low point in my life I made the decision to move to Australia from NZ to start a new life. After a night out on the town I was sexually assaulted and not long after I got charged with drink driving and I realised I needed to do something.My GP put me on to medication and I began seeing a counsellor every 4-5weeks. I no longer drink excessively or use drugs. All seemed well after a while and at the start of this year I chose to go off my medication because I felt great, I was healthy and have lost 15kg.I then began to feel low again and my doctor put me different medication which I had horrible side effects from. After a few months I didn't feel they were working so the doctor changed the dose.In October just after my 23rd birthdayI tried ending my life. I was so low and felt as though I could'nt deal with it anymore. Ten years I have been struggling with depression and anxiety. I didn't have another ten years in me.I was put onto medication, now see a psychologist weekly and have had to drop my hours at work. I had an allergic reaction to the medication last week and my doctor has since put me onto a different medication.I been diagnosed with severe depression and generalised anxiety disorder.I do everything possible to keepmy depression and anxiety at bay. I eat healthy and exercise regularly, I keep my brain active with study, I have a great support network of family and friends and reduce the stress in my life when I can, I attend talking therapies and take medication but its always there, the horrible thoughts about myself, the suicide idealations and the hyperactivity of my brain.Please tell me somewhere along the way it gets better?beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I apologise now to all the people on here that have really good reasons to be going through depression but if you looked into my life I haven't got anything to be sad about....but I am?
Looking back I think I've always been a 'dreamer' looking for something else all of the time....My beautiful supportive wife says she is content with her life and is thankful that we have two stunning, healthy and well rounded children and we live in an amazing place close to the ocean with a large house and pool..Why can't I see this? I'm so cheesed  off that I can't be grateful for these things and everything I do I feel what I can only describe as 'disappointed' like there is something better out there....
I have been to the GP who through no fault of their own seems like a production line of pill givers, trying to get as many patients through as quickly as possible...
I can't keep putting my family through my princessness as its not fair on them!
Anybody else felt this way and then coped with it?

I don't know what's happening to me. I was at the shops today and could not for the life of me remember how I got there or where my car was parked. I had my son with me and I totally panicked. I don't sleep well.at night I can't function well. I find my head is so fall of ""stuff"" I can't make decisions. My head feels foggy most of the time.i just want to sleep all day.  I have had depression and anxiety for many years been treated with medication. My 11 year old suffers with ptsd from a severe bullying incident. I might have had one or 2 great days in the last month. How do I know if my mind is falling apart? I feel like I am losing the plot. Any advice would be greatly appreciated

My first time on a site like this.  Had a horrible night of feeling disconnected and worthless, not interested in much....even though I know I have stuff I should be interested in and people are relying on me for support....  I am your typical listener, sometimes its easier to listen to everyone else's issues than to face my own, not even sure what my own are sometimes either.Have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety, great label hey?  It doesn't sound as bad as it feels though.  Feels like my insides, and everything that should feel good, is being grated with a cheese grater, but no-one else can see it, only me...beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi guys,
I'm new on here & don't know what I'm really doing. I guess I just want to share my story in the hope that maybe someone out in the world cares. I have been in & out of hospital for the last 5 yrs with depression, anxiety & an eating disorder. My husband left me  yrs ago ( he was an abusive alcoholic). My eldest daughter suffers with Asperger's, depression & social phobia - she refuses to have anything to do with her father so I have to care for her 24/7. My other 2 girls share their time between us both but are very unhappy when with their father. My 61 yr old mum is developing early onset dementia - I came home the other day to find her cooking banana bread in a saucepan on the stove cos it was easier than using the toaster!! My eldest daughter companion rabbit ( the only way to manage her meltdowns was to give her the rabbit) died a couple of weeks ago & she still isn't dealing with it. My extremely allergic 9 yr old had her tonsils out a few days later & she had an anaphylactic reaction to the anaesthetic!!. Then to top it all off a wind storm went through & lifted the roof off my house! My mood has been spiralling down the last few months but right now has completely plummeted. My eating disorder has resurfaced in the form of bulimia & is out of control so I'm feeling quite physically unwell to. I'm just so tired, I just don't want to do life any more. I'm wallowing in self pity but I can't be bothered pulling myself out of it - it's all to hard. I won't bail on life - I have my girls to keep me alive, they mean the world to me. 
I know this is really disjointed to read but I have trouble thinking straight & I have so much I want to say but don't know how. Thank you for listening to me vent, i'm sorry for dumping all my crap out there. I'm doubting myself now if I should post this.....

Hey all,
Thanks for reading this.
 
I hit rock bottom about a month ago now after my partner of 4 1/2 years left me. It has been the hardest time of my life.
I have been to my gp and I am now on antidepressants and going to see someone next week too help me.
 
My partner was my world she was everything to me including my best and ONLY friend I had in my life. I thought we were going too spend our lives together but like everything else in this world nothing lasts.
 
Everyday I struggle to live I wake hop wondering why what's the point in anything the pain and hurt ii feel is just to much I am so lonely but somehow I drag myself to work.
 
I don't want to be me anymore I wish I could cluck my fingers and change have friends and a new gf.
It seems to hard I hate the weekends they are the worst 
Sorry but yeah I need to vent.

You know how people say they feel all alone? Well for me it's not just feeling like that, it's 100% true. I have a partner and a young daughter but as my partner is suffering from depression too he can't be my support. We have no family or friends where we live. Both of us are unemployed and we have absolutely nothing to take our minds off our worries. every day is a struggle and we are finding it so hard looking after our daugther 24/7 with no help from anyone. Today I was suposed to clean the house but I can't get off the couch or stop crying so I'm writing this here cause I have no one else to talk to about how bad  I feel all the time. I just don't know what to do or how to get better. I don't get along with other women, I can't connect with anyone. All I want is to live near my family but they're on the other side of the world.

Hi allI’m new here to the Beyond Blue site...I’ve been struggling with what I think is depression for many years now though have never been diagnosed. I guess I’m worried about how my life will change if I am diagnosed with clinical depression.I am 42 now & my first feelings of depression were when I was 11, in the middle of the night in my parents kitchen. I thought about ending my life & just cried.This year has been probably my worst, I have been struggling at work & have had my darkest days & nights yet. I have a very supportive wife & 2 beautiful boys yet this doesn’t stop me from feeling as down as I do every day. The only person keeping me alive is my son, who I couldn’t bear to hurt by leaving him. I question my worth every single day....Especially since I have made a few mistakes at work which threaten my job..& it?s a career that I love. I question my contribution to my family, whether I’m a good dad & husband...I know that I am not the best at that either.I’m scared of what I might do to myself if things don?t ease..I’m scared that if I change jobs & I don’t feel any different will I have any worth any more? I am completely lost..Has anyone on here tried to deal with these feelings on their own?? What do I ask for if I go to one?beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I ran out of my antidepressant last Wednesday.  My wife went out today and I'm stuck with children.  I'm really a bit of a mess.  I'm crying over nothing at all.  I was watching Air Crash Investigation and started bawling when some lady thought her son was killed but then she found him alive.  And just random crying over nothing and thoughts of wanting to give up. There are certain things as well I'm having trouble with but I have anxiety, really bad, so I can't ring up to get help.  I have a script but no money to buy till Wednesday though I don't think I'll make it unless this is the worst it will get.  Don't even really know why I'm writing this.  I can't get help because I'm a guy and no matter how nice people are I think they still just sort of wish we would harden up and be men or that's how I perceive things anyway.  My wife controls all the money, she has a good job but she's a controlling person and I have anxiety thinking about asking her for the money for the medication.  I amtired of irritable moods she gets into when I ask for money, they can last for days sometimes weeks over 5 dollars which is ridiculous.  Not that I don't work I do work, 5 days a week 8 hours a day but I work for free because I don't feel worthwhile enough to ask for money in an actual paying job.  I get extremely anxious about competing with people in interviews and sort of fall apart in front of people in those situations.    Probably sounds insane but I guess that's why I have a mental illness because I'm slightly insane :)

For 8 years I have had anxiety and this year it has been a real rollercoaster. at one stage, I got it under control. but I missed it so much I brought it back upon myself. resulting from this I have suffered all this guilt and I started to question if I actually have anxiety and depression ( despite being formally diagnosed). this makes guilt worse and in turn the depression is getting worse. I haven't cried as much before as I have this week. I feel so flat, people are noticing. recent events I saw on the news trigger it too. I feel so bad for those people and It all just piles on. I cant do anything but sit and stare. any advice?

Hi, I am new here and I never really done this before, but i am going to give it ago. I have been suffering depression for a long time, but it was this year that it got really bad that I needed to get help . I find it hard to speak to anyone as i fear being judged by others. I am married and I am my younger sisters legal guardian and they are not that supportive when it comes tomy depression. My hubby tells me it all in the head and just to toughen up. My sister is a teenager and its all about her and what she wants and doesn't really care about anyone else.  I am a person that holds everything in and suffer in silence and just put a smile on my face even when i am suffering badly. I do see a psychologist but having to suffer in silence for so long and the things that happened in my past as a child I am finding it hard to open up to my psychologist.  For the last few weeks I have been dealing with my sister and husband fighting non stop everyday, I have tried to explain how this effecting me etc but they are not listening nor do they care. I have gotten to the stage that i am giving up, I am over feeling this way and not having anyone to turn to for support. I have lost my way and have no idea where i am heading i see no future and I see no light at the end of the tunnel.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi,I am new to this but here it goes...I have been suffering depression for as long as I can remember, as in life you have your ups and downs however lately the depression has been more frequent and to add to this I get anxiety at least twice a week. I am married, have a beautiful 8 month daughter, my own house, have a job (mature age apprenticeship) My relationship with my wife now feels content as there is no more intimacy as she istired from looking after our daughter. She has now been back at work for a couple of months and still the same. I try and share the load of raising our daughter as much as I can however there are times where she just wants her mum. I work 6 days and anywhere between 8 to 11-12 hour days just so we can get by. I somewhat know why I feel the way I do and everytime I try and talk to my wife about things I get no response until after a few times we both go into waterworks, then things go good for a week or so and then back into this vicious cycle. At this current moment its at a point where we are not talking to each other.I dont want to divorce as my wife a nd daughter is all I have.I'm at a point now where I dont know what to do anymore, I have had alot of suicidal thoughts but I know that is wrong (or just to cowardly to act?) Besides this post and talking to my wife i have not told anyone amd kept it all bottled inside. I dont feel comfortable talking to anyone else about it as I dont want to put them in uncomfortable position.I dont know where this post is going, feels like I'm rambling but feels good to get of my chest.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi I'm new here but Im certainly not new to the paralysing fear depression brings.Throughout most of my life I have felt detached from society, ashamed of myself, constantly fearing tomorrow etc and always ached to know why. I guess I convinced myself that I must have deserved to feel like this.I finally partially got my stuff together after a drug fuelled and failed adolescence. Studied, got a good job then imploded. I was diagnosed with PTSS 4 years ago. Working in a job I loved helped to focus on something other than my own thoughts for 9 hours a day but the other 15 were tough.I began healing with meds and therapy but all too soon thought I'd be OK on my own. I've fallen down again for the 3rd time in a few years. I decided to take some me time as I was feeling great... but too much time alone for me turns into alcoholic binges, forgetting meds and the feelings return.I have only achieved very few things that were on my ""to do list"" and my breaks nearly over. I feel ashamed of that too. I guess this is my first step in getting back on the healing wagon. I feel a little lighter even now. Thanks.

Hi
I'm new so I have no idea how to start this but I've been struggling through depression for 7 years which feels like forever 
this year I felt things were going well I moved in to a place and finally got out of a job that was making my mental spiral down within two weeks of my new job I was suddenly let go which was like a kick in the stomach I thought I was going good and from there I just seem to be going down hill. Even after these years and numerous psychologists I still can not figure out why I am this way I have an amazing family who are supportive and understanding 
i have always been a more suffer in silence type but the last time I felt this bad I was hospitalised 
After reading some of the stories I would just like to say thank you it means there could be a light at the end of the tunnel

I am 63 and I have depression I just do not have anything to look forward to any more. I have no money in the life just is not worth living for I am married for 39 years. I feel my life is just a waste I got sacked about 2 years ago after being on work cover  and was set up by the management and I took the bait I told them how I was feeling 2 days prior but they kept on bullying me and I lost my cool. 
I was an aged care worker for about 6 years and it was the best job I ever had. My union has given my case to the work cover  tribunal and have lawyers fighting my case for 2years. 
I have my ups and downs I am at the darkest at the moment I just think life is not wort living everything I do has been a failure My mother used to say I would not be any good. I have struggled all my life never had a good job been rubbished and made fun off I was called dummy never had friends. I am nothing the family I was raised in and brother and sisters I never see they never get in contact with me. I was not even mentioned on my mums grave. So life sucks

New member here.  I have been on medication twice in my life for depression / anxiety.  I feel like I am heading back to that way again.  The last time I was on anything was about 3 years ago. I am not sad (although I have days were I am, not many)  I feel like I am constantly irritated.  I am married with children, my husband works away, I do miss him when he is gone and am excited for him to come home, but when he gets here I don't want him near me this has only just started happening in the past 2 months, my children irritate me, people at the shops irritate me.  I am snapping at my children on a daily basis for simple things and that's not fair.  Hubby tries his hardest to please me and all I seem to do is complain about everything thats wrong and tell him that I am unhappy with everything, but I don't know why.  We have argued quite a bit in the past 2 months and if we have had a drink and any small thing he might say I will start a fight and I have become mean, I call him names, tell him how much I hate everything and I wished I never married him.  I feel like I have become a terrible person.  I have always been someone that over reacts and gets easily angered, from my late teens, I don't want to be this person, I grew up with a mother that was like that.  I seem to not be able to move on from things that have upset me or caused problems in the past and I will re think them and then get angry/upset again.  Is there really anyway to change yourself or I am going to be a snappy irritated person for the rest of my life?

My heart goes out to Phillip Hughes and his family and wish them our greatest sympathy, this also extends to Sean Abbott who must have the greatest weight of the world on his shoulders which could possibly  initiate a break-down. Situations like this are unavoidable, but truly devastating when unfortunately they do happen. I sincerely hope that their families, friends and any one connected with these two people seek professional help, as it will be a long road for them all. RIP. Geoff. x

I'm 31 years old and recently had to leave my job due to the immense stress having such a huge effect on my mental health. It wasn't planned and I left without having any sort of back up in place and now my poor wife is stressing out like crazy. I've applied for so many jobs I can't even remember them and the only 'interview' I have had so far was a shitty recruitment company trying to flog some government funded course at me.My wife is supportive and hasn't done anything to further the stress, in fact shes been looking up jobs for me as well and I've applied to any she forwards me, but I still feel souseless and have recently started developing some serious self-loathing. The last few days in between applying for jobs and dropping off resumes I've spent curled up on the couch sobbing and contemplating just ending everything. I don't understand why I feel this way but it's the only thoughts that seem to bring me any comfort at the moment and the worst part is I don't have any good reason to feel this way.What do I do? Who can I talk to?? I've tried talking to my wife but I just made her feel terrible and she thinks she has done something wrong. I already take medication for my depression but I've never felt this low before....beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hey people. have struggled and mostly controlled depression/anxiety for many years. It's always in the background but have used exercise, routine, distraction etc to get thru. Despite several hospitalisations and follow up with psychiatrists I have never done well on any anti-d's. I also have hashimoto's (hypothyroid) and initially had some success with armour thyroid. For the past week i have slowly begun a crash which is now beyond anything I have experienced before. Whilst the main symptoms are extreme depression , anxiety/ agitation+++ and debilitating fatigue, I somehow feel it is related to adrenal fatigue. I have been to a Gp who couldn't get me out of the office quick enough. i have a appt with my thyroid specialist tomorrow which I only got by pleading. Point is ...I am struggling to get through each minute and just feel like I can't make it through. Desperate for relief but don't know where to turn or what to do

Hi,
 
I'm 22 and have been suffering from depression for a bit over a
year. I've had a tendency to get down on myself since high school but
basically I had a big professional opportunity get cancelled due to
circumstances completely out of anyone's control which acted as the
major trigger. In the month or so following I moved back to Sydney from
Brisbane leaving behind a group of friends who were around all the time
and moved back in with my parents who had just decided to get a divorce.
So I basically went from an amazing living situation to a really toxic
and unpleasant one, and I couldn't move out as I was unemployed.

Around the middle of this year things started to turn around - Dad
moved out and got his own place in May or so, I got a job, and I am
hoping to have another chance at the opportunity I missed out on this
year - although there is still a chance it will fall through again. I
had a few sessions with a counsellor who suggested I try St John's Wort
to help with my depression and it worked well for me. But there have
been times when I forgot to take the pills for sometimes extended
periods of time and during those periods I get really frustrated with
myself that I even need to be taking pills to feel happy. Does anyone
else who's taken antidepressants feel like this?

 When my depression first hit last year it significantly impacted my
studies - I scraped through my exams but ended up not submitting a major
assignment that I needed to finish my degree. I lost all motivation and
I am still suffering from that now. I tried to take one subject this
semester and have had no motivation to study at all. I'm so angry with
myself because my parents have been so supportive of me while I have
been studying and I feel like I'm letting them and myself down and I'm
worried that my poor performance is going to impact on my post uni
options. I haven't told them just how much my studies have been impacted
because I feel so ashamed.
 I don't really know what to do.  I just feel... lost. My self esteem
is at an all time low,  I'm questioning my ability to pursue the career I
want and just feel like I'm failing the people I care about.

I'm finding that I am having more 'bad' days than 'good' at the moment.
If I get too overwhelmed or even angry, I cry. Sometimes hysterically. It's like I have no control. My actions (the crying) doesn't convey how I'm really feeling. It makes me feel weak. It makes me hate myself.
It feels like I'm stuck in this huge hole and I can't get out. You know? I nearly get to the top and then something happens and I fall back down again. 
But that's depression isn't it? Nasty thing it is.
Oh well. Just writing down thoughts.

A bit about myself before April/May 2014 -> I'm 22, I work full time in a call centre, the pay is really good, I have a loving boyfriend - soon to be fiance, I'm days away from picking up my first BMW, I go to church every Sunday, I go to the gym, I have about six loyal friends that have my back no matter what, I have a family that I love and would do anything for. I don't understand why even with all this I'm struggling to be happy let alone content. My dad works overseas in Iraq for a defence organisation in the counter terrorism field operations and intelligence division. He's been doing this ever since I was 7. My family and I only see him twice in a year and whenever he comes home - we drop everything to go spend time together as a family. My family and I are very close. Every time he goes back - I've noticed the same behavioural and psychological patterns. I don't feel motivated to go to work, I'm sick, I phase out, I stop caring about bills, commitments, my friends etc. Especially the last two months I've gradually started to take more  and more days off work. My dad visited the country and left four weeks ago. I've been off work for the past three weeks. Some days I pull a sicky when I'm not sick but not lately. I've had a cold, really bad headaches, bleeding noses twice a day, indigestion and days where I feel like my chest could cave in. Work used to be enjoyable. Church is now a time filler for my Sundays, I'm short tempered, emotional, easily angered, tired all the time, I cry about the little things, I'm insensitive, rude and just ""whatever"" with life and people. An incident at work that occurred in May2014 I know set me back a bit. I was one of the best in my role. I now doubt my ability to perform certain tasks at work, I stress about work and I'm cautious and anxious always trying to keep on the safe side in fear that I'll lose my job. I've cut some friends off because there was unnecessary drama and I don't have time for it. I'm confused. I don't know why I don't care anymore. I dont know why I can't force myself to go to work. I feel stressed, angry, sad and sick at the thought of going to work the next day. I don't understand why I have literally everything but I feel like I've got nothing but my family and my boyfriend. My family and I we all live in different suburbs, states, countries but even when I'm with my family i feel slightly happier but only because I'm not lonely. Am I depressed? Or do I just need to harden up? Help me :(

This is my first time since I was a kid that I've tried to reach out but I'm at the point where I know I need to talk to someone. I moved to Australia 2 years ago from Canada and it seems like a constant struggle since day one. I gave up everything I had back home to be with my partner here and although I love him very much, it's becoming extremely overwhelming. I haven't met any friends, his family and I don't get along although I have tried everything and it's become a wedge between us. I recently lost my job leaving me with zero income with adult responsibilities still to pay for, found out that my partner (after a year and a bit of being here he finally decided to come clean after being confronted numerous times) had cheated on me 3 times when we lived together in Canada and he lied to me about everything. I feel completely isolated and alone and when I get upset I need to walk away to avoid massive blow outs. I have pre existing depression and anxiety and it's increasingly getting worse every day. Sometimes I will just start crying and not have a reason that I can explain to anyone to have them understand. I have no one to talk to and feel like every time my partner and I try to discuss anything, it's turned around on me that I'm the one with the problem. It's hard enough to make friends as an adult but I feel with my anxiety that it's next to impossible. I've always felt like I'm a strong individual but inside I'm struggling to survive. I have next to zero trust in any one due to previous abuse (multiple types) from friends and family as a child continuing on to adulthood. The current relationship trust issues are extremely hard to get over. I feel hard headed in trying to stick up for myself but am always brought down and made to feel like it was my fault somehow. I feel like after losing my job (I have been looking non stop for a new one), that I am worthless and can't contribute to anything that I'd like to and that I'm just a burden. My defence mechanisms have become anger I guess...I get so upset when I feel like I've been wronged and in my head it clicks in to ""well, why did you trust them anyways?"" and I get angry with myself that I let it happen. I don't know where to start to deal with any of it other than to write it down like I have here...and if anyone does reply, than it's an added bonus haha

I'm so deep in my depression, I don't do anything anymore.... like at all. I don;t eat, sleep, do assignments, do the things I used to love and I gave up on my dream of singing a few months ago. I can't seem to get myself above it. I am under extreme pressure to the point where I don't want to wake up in the morning and go to school. I'm always handing stuff in late and the thing is I just dont care, My grades are sucking and I want to do something about it but I can't....Does anyone have an suggestions on how I can cope with the pressure and so i can do the things I love again? beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi I'm 28 and have been suffering with depression since my late teens.  I'm currently on medication but just in the process of switching.
I've been in Australia for just over a year and thought a move away from my old life in England would make me ""better"" but hence feelings have just travelled and I feel isolated from my friends at home. 
I've been in a really bad place for about 3-4 months now really urging myself to think positive but struggling to drag myself out of my ""pit"". Sometimes I feel like I want to scream and cry all at once and still this won't represent my thoughts. My work are great but I've been taking a lot of time off recently  unable to motivate myself to get to work or bursting into tears at my desk.  I feel like a burden.  
Some days I feel good and on my ""down days"" im worried my colleagues think I'm overreacting or being dramatic.  
I have my sister here in Melbourne but I push her away a lot not wanting to drag her into my mood.  I'm going through through a relationship breakdown because he doesn't understand my depression.  
I wish I knew what to do for the best. 
Louise

I've been suffering from depression for about 4 years now and didn't realise just how bad it was or that I even had it until I took an online quiz and read other peoples stories on beyond blue. The thing is I didn't have an major traumatic experience that caused my depression. My husband had been working FIFO at the time and had been doing it for 2 years at the time my depression started. At first I thought I was just feeling lonely and was missing him that's why I was feeling down but even after he came back for good I never got better. It's been 4 years now since I first realised I was depressed and I can't seem to break free from it. I used to be a very happy and bubbly person who used to enjoy going out and having a good time. Now I don't go anywhere I have no enjoyment in anything and just about find everything I do exhausting and a task even something as simple as going to the corner store which is literally down the road. I have no patience for anything or anyone. When my husband wants to take me out to dinner I get anxiety I don't wanna leave the house. I'm so unhappy I feel like nothing I do is good, I feel worthless, guilty about everything and nothing at the same time even though I haven't done anything wrong to anyone. I'm worried that my marriage is going down because of it, my husband is supportive but not in the way I need him to be because I can see how annoyed he is getting especially when he suggests we go out and do things and I always say no ALWAYS. I really hate myself for being like this with him but I can't control it I really really can't. I don't have any thoughts of suicide, thank god but I really am unhappy.

Hi, I'm not sure what to post here to be honest, or what to say. I've got ASD with side orders of major depressive and anxiety disorders... I came off my medication a few months ago and have had a slow downward spiral ever since, to the point where I've been in tears at work for no reason at all and have been panicking that - for some unknown, unspecified reason - I am going to lose my job. I've always fought my own battles - I have no family to speak of and my wifecan' t cope... she will be there for me but she can't help me through. But now I am working FIFO I can't fight it on my own, there's no escape. I've rung EAP and seen the site doctor who wanted to send me home because he thought I was (am) going to do something to myself... I convinced him (and my manager and my manager's manager) to let me stay. I need to keep busy and working; if I get sent home I will be just sitting there isolated from my workmates and with little support. As I wrote before, I'm not sure what I am doing posting here. Perhaps it just helps getting it out. I have difficulty communicating what is going on in my head to people. I have been speaking to counsellors etc. but I am not sure that I have got it across properly. I have some good friends here on site who have been going out of their way to help and understand which is great, however I also feel guilty about that, being a burden etc. I have found myself disguising it again if I am not doing well so I don't worry them or be an inconvenience. Stupid, I know, but I feel really naked and exposed and it feels like everyone knows about what's going on. It is a long, dark road. At times, like now, I don't know if it is worth travelling.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi, so I have been dealing with Depression and Anxiety for about 5 years now, since I was 16. I am now a 21 year old male, my mental problems I had gotten under control pretty well for the past 3 or so years, still having occasional attacks. Recently, within the last month I have fallen back completely into my depression, sometimes not leaving my bed or bedroom for days straight. I have had my roommate/friends come wake me up cuz it was 4:30pm, I couldn't get to sleep all night, til 12pm that day. What this post is about, is I just feel so lonely, stressed and depressed all the time. What I am wondering is, is it wrong of me to want to badly go into a mental rehab, only for a few weeks. Just so I can have a break? I don't want to have to worry about if I can afford to pay rent, or that 6 month over due bill. Or my career not going right, or the fact I can't go a day without drinking or getting high.. I started self harming again too.. Is it wrong of me to want to have this break? I have not been into a mental rehab as I hide my problems quite well. But I would think the people who visit are able to have a rest from life.. Again, is it wrong for me to want this..?beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I am 26 with depression. Lately with my financial and social issues it's become a real chore to continue day to day life. I lost my job that I really enjoyed four months ago and I am still unemployed. Between juggling bills, rent etc finances are very thin and I do not know how I'm going to feed myself until the next centrelink payment.
I am applying for work but I always get knocked back, sometimes without explanation. All this stress is becoming too much and I am afraid that I will collapse under all this pressure.

Hi All,I am new to this forum.I don't know what to do my life is completely messed up.I am a 30 year old male and have been diagnosed with anxiety and dysthymia after going to see a psychologist late in 2012.I was attending regular sessions up until early this year as I wasn't getting anywhere and felt my psychologist got fed up with me not doing what he told me to do to improve things. I have one good friend who I've been close to for about 12 years now but we don't see each other as often as we used to due to the busy life he lives (work, pursuing a music career, and long time partner). We catch up maybe once every 2-3 months if that, sometimes longer. However we have regular contact online and he or I will call to have a catch up over the phone.Apart from my good friend, I don't have anyone else and no social life as a result.I have never had many friends throughout my life, in school I wasn't very popular and cool to be with and felt I wasn't really accepted by people I hung out with after high school. From the age of 18-19 to about 25 I had a small number of friends but we just drifted apart and also I cut some out of my life, and feel I have been shunned.I don't know why I have never had a group of friends. I am shy but there are other shy types with friends. I am kind to people and down to earth so I just can't work out why I don't attract friends.I have former friends and people I have met on Facebook, they are pretty much internet friends. I can see how most have gotten married, had kids, are engaged, bought a home. Pretty much everyone is getting on with life and I am stuck and have been stuck going nowhere for years now.I have never had a girlfriend and still live at home with my elderly parents as I could not afford to move into a house I bought 3 years ago.I am renting it out and was hoping to find a higher paying job so I could afford to live in my home but I failed at all attempts. I have suicidal thoughts often, I live in constant terror of being alone.   I don' t know what to do, I fear death but also life. I am stuck in a vicious cycle, I am afraid to meet new people or go on dates because of the shame I have of not having friends.A few days ago I got invited by an artist to an art exhibition this week where she will be displaying her artwork. We got in contact after I contacted her on Facebook after seeing an article on her in my local paper.However I can't bring myself to reply to her email to say I will go because I feel like such a loser.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I had a double depression as I have now just realised I've suffered dysthymia for 6years. Always just feel flat for no reason and when good things happen I never get as excited or happy as I should or as others do. It turned into double depression three months ago when I had a big episode of depression.
I don't hear or see much about dysthymia and wanted to know if anyone else has it or has had it and have they felt anti depressants helped? I am on anti depressants currently trailing a higher dose and go back to my phyc next week to see if it needs increased. Because I have had dysthymia for so long does that mean it takes ages to go away? 
Any adivce would be appreciated. I have a place in my heart for everyone and anyone suffering depression - it is a real monster!

The pastt week I've finally come to terms with the thought I have depression. I hate myself, am never happy, keep pushing people away, especially the ones who mean the most to me, and never want to do anything anymore.
I've been fighting with my boyfriend so bad. And it was one of them fights that I realised and finally admitted to myself, and him. 
I just dont know where to go from here. I just want to get back to the old me :/

well another crap week of work is over again . felt like once again i didnt achieve anything like my life is in this kind of spiral that just doesnt end. everyday i think about which song i want played at my funeral as i dont want someone to play something i dont like it would annoy me ( i wonder when we die if we will be at our own funerals in spirit?) . the thing is i hate being sad all the time but if for whatever  someone could make me happy and well i really dont know if i would want that either? .everyday i wonder if it will be the last one i have on earth. im to scared of the pain of suicide so it isnt an option for me . 

i really hate the human race at times though i feel if i was dying in the middle of a busy street people would be to busy to stop and help me and walk right past me. people on this planet really need to learn to spend time with one another rather than watch tv and sit on facebook. at times i actually wonder if im the one with mental health issues ? 

thanks again

Hi, for about 4 or 5 years now I've been experiencing problems in which I feel have I completely changed from what I believed to be an intelligent, active and healthy teenager into an unmotivated, run down mess. I thought keeping this bottled up and not letting anyone else have to worry about it would be fine, but I feel myself deteriorating and need to let it out.I would have been in Year 11 in 2011 when I believe it started. Before then I was doing exceedingly well in my schooling to the point where teachers considered me skipping a year level, I was engaging in high level soccer, futsal, and basketball (and enjoying it), whilst in spare time I would go out with friends and enjoy their company and vice versa. In 2011 our family moved out from an area which I was able to ride my bike to school, to a quite isolated area (which I'm currently at) in which the only methods of transportation was either by car or by bus which would normally take an hour or so of the day to get to school. I live in a small house with 7 (grandfather, parents, 2 sister, brother and I) people and I sleep in the same room as my brother. During 2011 my sleeping patterns and overall sleep quality has gone  due to my brother being on noisy electronics and watching movies in his bed whilst I tried to sleep, and despite efforts to stop it I haven't been able to revert since. I'd catch the bus  to school and struggle to focus during class and even fall asleep, causing me to fall behind almost to the point where I was failing basic subjects. I dropped out of all my sports that year because I felt no passion in them anymore and my skill dropped. What was worse is that my parents noticed this and they didn't seem to care or make any attempt to help me out which further reduced my motivation to do well. I ended up scraping through VCE and in 2013 I worked 2 which totalled to 50 hours a week, so I could simply buy a car to reduce travel times so I could start studying. Travel times basically meant that I had to choose out of work or a social life.So I now have my car, and I am able to travel to uni, however cost of living at home and save at the same time whilst passing my course means I am working non-stop just to make ends meet.. and I can't even focus on my work, I have no friends, I'm constantly getting sick, I can't have a conversation with someone because I haven't gone out and experienced or felt anything for so long, and I feel alone and unsupported by my family.

Well I guess I best introduce my self, I'm 22, live at home with my parents still whom act unappreciative of my existence in our house, even though I know they 'love me' they sure don't act like it. We barley have any form of conversations and if we do, its more like aggressive talking towards me.
I started my own events management company whilst working fill time else where as well, and recently held my first event (expo) which 120-ish people came to and to which I spent every waking minute for the past 8 months planning and co-ordinating leading up to it. Which I'm proud that I've achieved at my age.
Meanwhile I've been dating this guy since January, we started off pretty perfect and to which I have never felt more in love with in my life, we had planned to go to New York during new years, (to which I found out he was planning to propose)
Probably about 7 months ago I caught him lying to me on multiple occasions and he had done something which he knows is not ok in my books and is something that my previous (and only other x boyfriend) did but on a more extreme level. He looked through my phone while I was sleeping. I caught him. He denied it.
I then caught him looking through my laptop while I had fallen asleep, I caught him again, he denied it. He then admitted to doing it to my best friend, and also told her that he had hacked my emails from his house as well as my Facebook. Which he then also admitted to me when I confronted him.
I have nothing to hide at all, its more of a trust thing. Since that day, I have felt empty, all the time I used to enjoy my job, I now no longer enjoy anything at all. I don't even feel a strong connection with him anymore, the only thing I seem to want to do is go out and drink.
I'm now stuck with these plane tickets to New York, which I saved so hard for I have told him I refuse to go with him.
Had planned to go with my best friend instead since we have been meaning to go for years and years. She has now also cancelled due to work.
I feel empty constantly, not knowing what I'm doing, feeling like I'm wasting my youth and my time in life. now I have no feelings for anything. No motivation, I've stoped working on my business which used to be my passion and drive for everything and although I'm still with my boyfriend, we had a 5 month break which didn't seem to help, he's very understanding and accommodating now but I honestly feel as though I have no idea who I am and that I'm dead inside & have no idea what to do

Hello fellow beyondblue members,having a psychologist appointment today for ptsd problems we touched on the more personal side of my life and this has triggered a deep low which I'm having trouble coping with. There was the mention that even after being medicated for 18months I still quite frequently have active suicidal thoughts and tonight these have triggered again . I feel like I'm just about to lose it completely. If anyone is there that can chat that would be good as I'm in need of some emotional support . Id like to touch on a little bit of history. I was diagnosed back in 2005 with a ""minor"" depressive disorder and was untreated for 8 years. Was only last year that depression worsened and was diagnosed as a major depressive disorder. Have been medicated since being hospitalised for trying to end the pain in May last year all was ""well"" apart from the ""highs"" that I was getting but didn't say anything as it felt good when I was in a euphoric mood. Was only about a month ago when I spoke up and have recently been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder. I believe I have told most of the story. Any input on how to break free from this monster that is eating at my mind would be great.

Hi everyone,
   So I will try to be as brief as possible. I am suffering from depression. I have felt this way for the last 15 years. I never really addressed it until 3 years ago after a very mentally abusive relationship. I guess that was the catalyst. I have seen a psychologist and a psychotherapist and I am on an anti-depressant. I still have bad days but I have come a long way in the last 3 years.
I find it very hard to control my sleeping patterns. For instance, yesterday I was in bed at 12am, turned my alarm off whilst half a sleep, slept through the other 3 alarms I have set, and wake up 16hrs later. Other nights I may only sleep for 4-5hrs. No matter what, I feel tired. I lack energy during the day, and I find it hard to even get the energy to exercise. I have read that depression may cause tiredness. And my psychologist says the same. People seem to think that I am just making an excuse for being so tired, and that it is my lifestyle which is causing the issue. But I think it is the depression myself. I am not trying to make an excuse. But it is what it is. Is it normal for people to think like this? It makes it so much harder at times.

Sometimes I feel like expressing my terrible feelings to the world (the royal ""world"".  Not actual people, because I would feel uncomfortable doing that.  Just... to spurt my displeasure out of myself and into reality) with (mostly groaning) sounds.  But there are people around who will be very confused.  So here is a textual representation of the sounds I want to make.

Hi,
Thank you for providing such an open forum for people to learn and discuss these issues  I was diagnosed with depression only a couple of weeks ago but the battle has been ongoing for about 12 years. Until recently I didn't know what I was dealing with and why I behaved the way I did.
I'm finally starting to gain an understanding of what has been happening and why but I'm struggling at the same time. I have only spoken to my wife about this battle and she is an endless source of support but I still feel somewhat alone with this battle.
i've started taking medication and have found it's levelled me out from the extremes I'd been showing - irratability, anger, sadness and self loathing. I've also found though that days like today I struggle to get motivated about anything. I'm an active person and train very regularly but days like today I can barely get myself out of bed, am not hungry and it then turns into feelings of guilt for being so inactive. 
I guess im looking to anyone to talk a bit more about this battle. I'm a bit lost and unsure of what to do.
 
thanks

Last night I was invited to join 3 other friends for dinner.  Two of us drank a bottle of wine.  I was feeling really happy and was feeling relaxed and having  good time.  But that changed very quickly. By the time I got home I was so feeling a bit strange.  Within a few minutes of going to bed I could feel my anxiety building up; I could feel my emotions rising. I don't know if it was the alcohol and anti depressants.
 Why couldn't that relaxed feeling stay with me a bit longrer. Maybe if I keep drinking my body will get used to it and I would feel good. The 3 hours of being together with friends and drinking was good, I didn't even think of any negative thoughts.

Today I'm having one of the worst depressive episodes I've had in 2 years. My head feels like it's going to explode and I can't escape.
This is the first time I've ever sought help, and for anyone reading you are the first people I've ever told. But I desperately need to vent and get some things off my chest.
I don't know what went wrong in my life to get to this point, I feel almost ashamed writing this because my life is relatively normal. Yet I can't explain this feeling that has steadily been building and worsening since I was 16 (26 now).
I guess I'll start with lack of intimacy, I'm a male and I struggle with the opposite sex, I've never had a girlfriend. I have zero confidence and self esteem and I heavily rely on alcohol as a crutch. The only time I've ever been sexually intimate or intimate at all is when I'm absolutely plastered.
I sometimes get very anxious socially, and I stew and dwell on how I react with people. I have never truly been comfortable around people, I have somehow learnt to merely pretend by observation.
I probably drink once or twice a fortnight, but when I do binge to excess and lately I've started to act out antisocially. I never used to be an aggressive person but lately I've found when I drink I will shove and intimidate other guys, or I find myself being dragged out of a place kicking and screaming. I see myself going down a dark path and I'm scared I'll hurt someone or be hurt.
Today was a bad day, its almost 1am and I can't sleep, I had a big night on the weekend. I balled my eyes out earlier.
I have friends and family but I feel utterly alone in this world, I want to feel intimacy with someone, just to hold someone. I'm a good person, I'm loyal to the people that love me, without them I could never cope.
I have so much negativity in my head all the time, I think it shows and drives girls away from me, I just wish I had the confidence to make a move, say something interesting. I feel down all the time and its a never ending cycle, its not just the lack of intimacy, there are other issues rattling in my head as well.
Its a mindset I wish I could shatter and just live, after so many years its become ingrained, I cant remember the last time I was happy.
I don't know if anyone will understand my ramblings I just typed the first things that came to my mind. Thanks for giving my the space to put this somewhere, I hope this catharsis will let me sleep at least for now.

I have been suffering mental illness from the age of 12 years old.  I am now 44.  I have survived 3 suicide attempts and have been on medication for over 30 years.  Although my family were aware of my low points I have only just come out to closer friends and extended family.  I admit, I feel embarrassed and sensed that some people fear it.  I don't blame them because it scares me also.  BUT it's the world I live in.  My illness is strange and I go through extended periods of euphoria followed by short periods of depression.  I love being the strong, friendly and comical relief to so many but I dread the next stage.  This period is what I call the DARK SIDE.  As I grew familiar with my episodes I decided to document them in a diary called ""Letters from the Dark Side"".  These were letters I wrote to myself when at my greatest low to help me recognise the symptoms and feelings I had during that time.  It is my voice at a time when I can't speak, one I hope to one day give to others to allow a greater understanding of where we go when at our lowest.  I just hope with the understanding people gain from my notes will give a better inside into how to help rather than helping in ways that can sometimes further intensify the darkness.  I want to show them the hand that helps.

I became diagnosed earlier this year with depression and anxiety and started to take medication for it. I have felt much better on the medication but my family thinks they can see extreme 'highs' and 'lows' in my behaviour. I don't feel these highs and lows I just think my behaviour is normal. I don't know how to change my behaviour to make them worry less about my emotional state.

I am 43 sole carer of 2 children  I love and adore my children. Bit I hate my lot in life. Sounds crazy I am sure. I wouldn't change my kids for anything but I hate being alone. I have been alone for 8 years. I long for someone to cuddle me and give affection. I have severe depression and anxiety. I have immense guilt feeling like this. I know it is selfish but I would dearly love to have someone in my life who loves me( I know my kids love me but it isn't the same). I am overweight which I know doesn't appeal to men and the fact I have 2 kids full time. I lay in bed at night and cry. I am so lonely. I seem to have so many things going on in my life I know I will be alone forever. It's a horrible daunting feeling. I am recently thinking that once the kids are adults my pain can end. The kids won't need me or want me around. The thought of me being even more alone is unimaginable. No body I know gets the loneliness and isolation that I live with. I feel like I am hanging on by a thread until the kids are just that bit older. I am a good person. I have made mistakes. I feel like I  am being punished for the rest of my life. This dam black dog is my punishment and I am scared of succumbing to it.

Everything I seem to do is wrong.
 I'm starting a new job next week and I'm scared that I'll fail and let everyone down.
 I've been drinking too much and sent a message to one of my friends that was hurtful and now I feel sick with guilt and will eventually have to face them.  One of my other friends sent me a message saying I was nasty and not a true friend.  Alcohol always seems to get me into trouble and I say or do things I don't mean.  I need to try and give up drinking I'm not an alcoholic and don't drink every day but I do binge and drink most to every weekend.  I need help to try and stop drinking as I really do believe things would be allot better if I got help but I don't know where to get help?  As I don't think AA would suit what I need.
 I'm single over 40 and feel that my opportunity to have children had passed me by, I'm over weight, have no drive to exercise, some Saturdays I spend the whole day in bed and wonder why I'm here at all.
 I feel empty inside and don't know what to do.
 I don't feel like a good person today and just feel sick.

I am sitting here after just signing up with this site, because I just need to find someone who understands. I am presently crying while typing and haven't a clue why. I have suffered from depression for many years & have tried lots of different medications, some didn't work & some were ok. I then went to a Psychologist because I felt suicidal, for no reason, and after a few sessions felt the best I had ever felt & found that just getting lots of junk out & seeing it for what it was, was liberating.  So what's happened? Am I ever going to be free of this? Am I ever going to be able to come out of self imposed isolation because I don't want people to see my emotional frailty? My family members tend to avoid me as one day I am there for them & the next, I'm hiding under the bed, my husband keeps telling me to get a grip & I sincerely wish I could oblige him!! In my family, I am the mother/sister/wife/Grandma who needs to be there for them and more than anything I would love to be that person & aspire to be that person, but when I am not coping, they see me as unstable & someone to avoid.  My solution to avoiding this kind of hurt is to hide & disconnect from those who are close to me. I find their altered treatment of me, because of my condition, to be condescending & unbearable, it's like a vicious circle.I think a lot of the problem is loneliness and the need to connect with people who understand this journey.  beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi All, been a while.
A few months back I started on medication for my depression and anxiety and I had a great response to it. I went from being in a constant struggle every single day to feeling like my old self again just over a couple of months. I started seeing the light again and got over the issues that was troubling me horribly. I even started to get back into dating again...
And then I met her. This girl I knew through high school suddenly came into my life again. We met at a party, got talking, I got her number and we went out a week later. Everything went well. We went out a few more times, then more and more frequently. And then I realised that I had completely fallen for this girl. I cannot stop thinking about her. Every time she left my house I hated it. I just want to be with her all the time. So I did the only thing I could and I told her the way I felt. She said it's not a good time and she just wants to be friends. 
Okay that's her decision, fair enough, she did get out of a relationship about a month ago. But I'm still seeing her.  A lot. Like 3 - 4 times a week. She laughs at everything I say, we message each other constantly, she sends me flirty photos, whenever she comes over we end up cuddling on the couch. How is this what friends do? 
Bottom line is I just can't take it. My depression and anxiety have come right back because of this. The fact that she's become such a large part of my life yet she isn't my girlfriend is just killing me. She's hangs out with other guys sometimes too. That's when my anxiety and depression just goes insane. I guess i'm still hopeful that something might come out of this. Even her friends tell me that she likes me. 
Everything was fine until she came into my life. Now the only time I feel good is when I'm with her or messaging her. Thanks for reading, I just really needed to vent this. 
 Love hurts.

I'd like to ask others here how they deal with losing at any form of comparative play. A few months ago my sisters boyfriend introduced me to Magic: The Gathering. For those that may not know, it's a collectible card game in you build a deck made up of spercific cards and battle others. There are thousands and thousands of variables that can potentially come into play depending on the deck you play against and your own deck. It is a very mentally taxing game, lots of strategy and you've no idea how the deck you have will play until you play it against someone.
Anyhoo, I've been going with friends to Magic game night and I have been enjoying it for the most part. However, I find that if I have a bad night, say I lose each game or, even worse, get utterly smashed, I get really depressed and consider giving up all together. For example, last night I lost every game. I had a new deck that I had been working very hard on. My friends helped me put it together and make it better. We tested it against various deck and every time it went really well. Even if I didn't win, it was very close.
Last night at the game night, though, I was thrashed. Utterly. Every game. What I experienced was a mix of anger at""wasting"" all this time building the deck, having my friends help me with it and playing game after game with them to test it; frustration at having it perform really well in those test games only to get thrashed at the actual game night and depression thinking that everyone there probably thinks I'm a useless, rubbish player and if they come across me with think ""this guy, he's crap. I'm gonna thrash him."" It made me feel very worthless and I just wanted to get out of there and hide away.
By the time I got home I'd calmed down a little. I was still somewhat depressed but decided to chalk it up to having a bad night and I'd try a different deck next week. It stuck me how affected I'd been by the experience, however, and wondered if it was indeed my depression coming through or I just didn't know how to deal with losing. I'v never been into sport or really any other kind of competitive play so I guess I've not had much experience with losing.
So, the question is do you think my feeling were depression related, or related to my lack of experience and how can I deal with this in the future? Any advice would be much appreciated.
 Cheers.

A couple of years ago I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD (I think this is what its called) anyway at first I could not accept it, took 18 months for me to absorb, reject and fight. Now I feel im in a world of my own. I feel people don't understand what I say, lost within myself. Some days I go a million miles to the dozen others I struggle to motivate. it is such a roller coaster. I thought I hit rock bottom when I was diagnosed until a couple of weeks ago I was hospitalized due to a suicide attempt. Now I don't feel like im bouncing back, trapped. When I talk to my family its like watching there face go here we go again .

I'm Glen, 35 and yet again single. I would describe myself as (when I'm normal) funny, optimistic, helpful, caring and understanding, sporty and a good guy. In the last 10 years I have done my absolute best to be a great friend, a good worker and try to hopefully have a wife and family of my own. However whenever I try to improve my current situation I keep getting crapped on ie started at a gym - got cancer, started a uni degree - job changed so had to defer, had a good relationship - out of nowhere she gets pregnant and wants an abortion (she was on the pill) and I got no say in it. That's just to name a few of the utterly terrible things that have happened to me over the last year but this kind of crap has been happening to me for the last 10 years. I'm seriously at a point where I can barely find a reason to keep going as everything I try just blows up in my face with crap that's out of my control. Apparently being nice nowadays means you get stepped on, being chivalrous and respectful to your girlfriend isn't bring a ""real man"", I'm so tired of waking up everyday and knowing if it wasn't for pain and suffering I would have no purpose in life at all. I saw the ad on tv for this so thought I'd give it a go before finding a permanent solution to end thisonce and for all, I've tried many different therapists who have told me to ""keep doing what your doing"" but when does the point in life come where it starts rewarding you with love and respect for doing the right things instead of continual suffering and heartache? help....please...Glenbeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Last night, I was watching TV with my partner (some WWE thing, not my thing, but he enjoys it so I watched with).
Anyway, the episode/story we watched was quite emotionally charged, with the main wrestler having died very suddenly a few days after he got this big award or something. (not entirely sure) but all I know is that he died. 
Well that did it for me, I HAVE NO IDEA WHY, but tears started leaking down my face. I started to sob. My partner asks what's wrong? I tell him, I don't know. How can I tell him what's wrong when I don't even know myself?
I sat down next to him on the lounge and he gave me a hug. 
I told him that I just don't know whats wrong with me, that I can't pinpoint one particular thing and say 'yeah thats it, that's why I'm sad"".
He gives me another hug, and says 'I don't know why you are depressed for, things aren't that bad.""
well holy crap the tears started pouring down even more.  
I said to him ""so you don't think there's a reason for me to be depressed? or you just don't understand why i'm depressed?""
Thank god he said the latter, but it still hurt a bit, you know?
He's very black and white, if something doesn't fit, he just let's it go.
I am not like this. There are so many different shades of grey between those black and white points.
I over analyse things, where as he just makes a consecutive decision. 
I dwell, he moves forward.
I have told him over and over again that if I could have just even a little bit of the strength he had to be able to live in a black and white world, my life would be so much easier. But, of course, that can't happen.  I will never see things as black and white. 
What if this is who I am? A person who cries at the drop of a hat, who's broken, who has a mental illness. I'm spending so much money on medications and psychologists, and psychiatrists that it's starting to become a little overwhelming. Things aren't getting better. What if this is it. This is me, broken, unable to be fixed?

Hello Everyone. Ive written on this site before. I have BPD and Dysthymia and feeling very emotional and depressed. I went to a emergency refuge clinic as I wasn't coping with anything at home and I had time to think and reflect about myself and didn't need to worry about my daughter as my folks were looking after her for a week while I was there. Then when I came out my grandma came to stay with me for 3 weeks as she heard I wasn't that well so she travelled all the way from Darwin. She leaves tomorrow evening and I feel very upset about it and know that im going to be completely on my own since I was in the clinic. To make things worse my sister is upset with me as she thinks shes not welcome here because one day she wanted to come over and said I was busy so she just said she'd see my dad and now she thinks im only going to want her company when my grandma leaves. Shes currently pregnant and very emotional so I think that may have something to do with it. Im upset about all of this and don't know what to do as ill be all alone and no one to talk to. :'( :'(

I'm not really sure where to start.  Just that I don't really expect this to accomplish anything, but that's my catastrophic nature, I guess.  I'm 35 and I've struggled with depression for longer than I knew what it was, as far back as primary school.  I have only been on medication for about 2 years now.  I have trouble sleeping and feel tired ALL the time.
My story is not that dramatic.  The more I read people's stories and see the things going on in other people's lives and what they have had to deal with, the more I think that what I feel is totally unreasonable and selfish, and I can't seem to break that pattern of thinking.
My life is okay, there's nothing remarkable about me.  I'm employed (though not in a job I love).  I grew up with a single parent (mum), who loves me.  We were not well off, but had what we needed.  My mum and at least one of my sisters have also struggled with depression.  I try not to burden them when I have bad days because I know they struggle too.  And there's the cowardly part of me that knows I'm not particularly good at dealing with other people's emotions and I feel totally unable to handle their situations on top of my own.  That makes me feel even more worthless and selfish.  How can I expect them to be there for me when I feel I can't be for them?
Another example of my cowardly nature concerns my grandfather who is very sick and has been for some time.  I don't go to see him very often, and never by myself, because I feel so uncomfortable there now.  I know this upsets him because his family is everything to him.  My mum called me tonight at work to tell me he had had a fall and was in the hospital.  Tomorrow he goes into surgery and no-one is sure that he will come out of it.  Apparently Pop was asking to see me and wondering why I didn't go to see him as much as the others do.  The thought of having that conversation with him is terrifying to me.  I got off the phone and was in tears, thinking about how awful a granddaughter I've been.  He is suffering a lot more than I and I can't get the courage to give him the one thing that keeps him going, though all others around me can.  What does that say about me as a person? 
This post was supposed to be cathartic.  I appreciate your time if you've managed to work your way through this pity party.

Does anyone else sleep off their depression?  Some people drink, some people take drugs.  I do neither.  But when im feeling low, all i want to do is block out the world & sleep.  I feel guilt for this.  Days will go by & all Ive done is sleep, eat and watch TV.

Hi guys,
 I was diagnosed about a year ago with depression, after struggling for many years prior to that. I'm undertaking counselling and taking anti depressants and have good days and bad days. I'm working full time, and studying part time. 
Recently, I went through a breakup of sorts. I say of sorts as I'm talking about the first person I ever really opened up to, and the person who encouraged and helped me to seek help. We broke up for a period before I was diagnosed when I was overseas, however we have continued talking for the majority of the time, and for the past year he has been helping me cope with living with depression. He's the only way that I normally go to when I'm down, and he often helps get me out of my rut, purely by just being there. 
 A couple of weeks ago he told me he just wasn't feeling the same, and thought we should stop seeing each other romantically, however he still cares about me and wants to talk to me (which I don't quite understand). So understandably, I was quite upset about that, and it also happened the week before my mini thesis for my masters was due. My nonna was also in ICU at this time, so I was having a rough time there too. 
 so that's what I've been trying to deal with recently, and I was coping through getting out and exercising, and seeing friends. 
 however, one week ago I broke my leg. I was hospitalised for 5 days as I requires surgery to place a plate and screws in. All of my friends were amazed at how positive I was throughout the whole thing, whereas inside I was struggling and just wishing my ex could be there. We talked, he knew I was in hospital, yet he didn't ask if he could visit.
 now I am at home, on bed rest, and everything seems to be hitting me as I cannot seem to keep myself occupied as I previously could. No runs or walks, no going out etc. I try to read and watch movies  but I just can't seem to concentrate and only drift into a spiral of sadness. 
 Does anybody out there have any ideas or strategies or just thoughts on how I could try and cope a little better? It has been good to get this all out, and I would love if someone could take the time to reply.
 thanks for reading.

Hello everyone. I have had depression for most of my life and take antidepressants regularly. I've been feeling pretty low lately and teary, yet I'm finding it difficult to say anything to my husband. I have 3 children- 2 grown up and one about to go to College next year, as well as a stepson, 2 daughter-in-laws and 3 grandkids.I spend most of the week alone at home with my dog. I feel very lonely and don't have any siblings or parents nearby. I am finding it hard to get dressed in the mornings and get little satisfaction from most things. I attend church regularly, yet  feel like I have few good friends. My mum was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer and already suffers from Alzheimers. I went over to give my support recently and found myself having to be the strong one for everyone else. I'm tired and wonder who is there for me when I'm in need. My sister didn't support me very much when I was fragile and this is very annoying, even though I know she has a lot on her plate at home too. I cried for the first time last week, shortly after going to bed...I couldn't talk about what i was feeling because it was overwhelming. My husband asked me what was wrong, hugged me then went back to sleep. He never asked me anything after that. His mum is old and has been depressed from chronic pain.She stayed with us last week and I had primary care of her. I feel guilty because I really didn't need someone else to care for, and I didn't feel I was being cared for either. My husband wants to bring her for another week at Christmas. I feel very alone and very tired. I've felt down before, but sometimes it feels like nothing changes. I terrified to stop taking meds, as I can find myself in this black hole even when I take them diligently

I' m lost. I have not a hard life. It was. But I fought and made a fair one. Through constitution. Now I contribute to life through an act I don't see the point in. I had so much work to do to put myself on a level playing field I forgot what it was all for. Now I am adrift. I seem to float in and out of peoples gaze only to end up frozen in time. In front of my reflection.  I am just here without purpose. Drifting. Dreaming. Searching. I am. I can. I do. Still nothing to need. I stare back at the reflection and desperately ask for a reason. A point. I dont feel sad. I feel little emotion. I would kill for my own little piece of real sadness. Empathy consumes me. I must have a purpose other than to feel other peoples anguish. Other than to listen and calm them. Where is the peace I promised myself. I walk through wonder, possibility and chaos yet my heart does not stir. What did I give up that day. Where did I hide it. Where do I turn. What am I meant for.  I don't empathize with peoples joy. Only their worry and heartache. It feels like everyone is flying past me at a million miles an hour when I'm amongst the crowds. Endlessly drifting through space. Another cog in the great machine. A man that does not understand love anymore. A dreamer without a dream. I'm half the man I used to be, I'm half the man you see. I lie till I become the lie. I'm not honest to myself. I'm ordinary. I' m scared out of my mind. I beg myself to change.  This is the first time I have ever spoken about this to anyone. I'm not sure what to expect from this really. Is there something wrong with me. My heart tends to feel like it has butterflies from time to time. I find it easier to speak in broken sentences when I try to express my inner dialogue.

Hey guys,New here, but not really to Depression.Started early 2011, I was becoming unhappy at work & starting to get that feeling where you sort of wanted to cry but wouldn't. Thinking I was just unhappy with my job, I decided to quite a few months later.I started to go to the gym more often & even got really into it. Started meeting new people, started doing those mud runs/fun runs etc.. and found something new. Though throughout the year there would always be a day here & there where I would just be sad for no reason. It got to the point where I would cry, for no reason, & a day would become a couple days, which would eventually become a week. I had no idea what was happening or why. By the end of the year, I decided to study, have something to focus on, to look forward to.2012 everything became much worse. I would wake completely depressed, stay in bed, cry & wanted my life to end. I knew somthing wasn't right, so I jumped online & took some tests regarding depression & figured that's what I had, though still doubted it as I hadn't hurt myself or attempted suicide.Studying was stressful, it was something new & I couldn't understand a lot of it, I felt pretty stupid, which I guess would contribute to me feeling down. On-top of that, I wasn't eating well & was training a lot + I had some family issues. By August, I hated my life, hated anything I was interested in, everything just became bad. Start of 2013 I decided to see a GP & went onto medication & eventually saw a Psychologist, though neither really helped. I started a (temp) job at the gym, which I loved, but some things went down with the staff that made me depressed again & eventually the job finished which made me really upset. To me, the place that I enjoyed the most, with people that I enjoyed being around, I felt were somewhat responsible for causing me to feel low, so I ended up leaving.6months later, still upset, no longer on meds, they made metired, I returned, and ended up talking to them about what happened, and even breaking down & crying. Only problem is, even today, I still feel hurt, everything that happened still upsets me, every time i wake up, even though ive spoken to them many times, It all just upsets me. A month ago I started becoming really depressed & thinking of suicide, I was put on medication again. i put membership on hold & went back to the GP & started  & now looking for a Psychologist, though don't know who to see (western sydney). Sorry for the long post, but does anyone have any advice ?beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi, new to this sort of thing, feeling like I have pretty much run out of options, I'm a new dad to a beautiful 6 month old IVF bub, my wife has suffered depression for around 7 years and is suffering PND very badly ATM, wife went through cancer, loss of her dad, brother in jail, we relocated to central Qld 12 months ago at the request of my company, they unfairly dismissed me and I was out of work 6 months ago, i took them to court and won the case. Working again now but it's tough going. My wife hates it up here. Today I broke, my wife is aware of her depression but struggles to see anyone, after many years of encouraging her to go to a doc, holding her hand and trying to be supportive I broke down and cried for about an hour, not a real manly thing to do, still crying as I write this as I have never really thought back and spoken about this before. Feeling very helpless that I can't fix the problems for my wife, that I don't make as much money as I used to and I have to sell everything off to survive, that I feel to blame for moving my wife up here and all she wants to do is go back to vic, we can't afford to move back, I have trouble sometimes settling the baby, wife says I'm never around but all I do is work and come home, I don't know anyone up here so there isn't much for me to do. Feeling very helpless and that I have lost me... So sad that I can't fix our problems anymore and life has become so hard and complicated. I just want my wife and baby happy more than anything. I feel a bit silly writing this stuff down, normally I'm in control of my life and have direction now it feels like it's put of control and I'm heading into a dark place. The pressure is way too high, we have another baby on the way, due in May next year, not sure if my wife can cope with the additional pressures, me working to put food on the table and a roof over our head, stressed out to the max and I can't keep up, how do I get help for my wife?? How do I fix it?? How can I provide a better life for mum and bubs?? I try to always do my best, what happens when I'm not good enough and I fail?? I just want things back to normal well as normal, want my wife happy and running out of options

Hi,I just joined this site with hopes that I can connect to others dealing with depression like I am. I have a history of depression and a few years ago, I attempted suicide. I was glad for quite a while that I was unsuccessful, but I find myself lately wishing that I would have died then. This post kind of jumps all over the place. I apologize. Its the best I can do right now. Just to give a little back story, I am a transgender guy. I have been transitioned for a few years now and that helped immensely with my feelings of depression/suicide. I am still happy regarding my transition. However, shortly after my transition, my family began to get sick. My dad has had several strokes and is now disabled. My mom has battled cancer 3 times and tries to take care of my dad. I will always be willing to care for them should the need arise.  However, my brother has thrown a monkey wrench in everything!! He is a nice guy, but I remember numerous times hearing him curse people and wish death on them. For years, my wife and I told him that he needed to see a doctor because we were pretty sure he was diabetic and or had kidney/heart problems. He chose to ignore our concerns and not go see a doctor for the discoloration and swelling in his legs. He also continued to have a diet consisting mostly of fast food. He ended up having such bad kidney disease that he is now on dialysis.He has also lost most of his eyesight and has had toes amputated.He has a long history of not paying his rent and I have no idea how he even still has his apartment! Even when he was working, he didn't pay all of his rent and has come to expect his landlord to just accept however much rent he has to pay her.He also lost countless jobs by acting like an ass at work, which has no doubt allowed him to blame others for his actions.Fast forward to early this year. He began having worsening issues with his eyesight and has since lost all sight in his left eye and most in his right. He expects us to come over to his apartment whenever he needs something and then complains the whole time about how lonely he is and how he has no one. He has also told several people that my wife hates him even though she has never done anything to him. She just chooses to not get involved with his drama.I believe I should have a right to enjoy my life and not be responsible for him. I feel trapped though. I just don' t know what to do. Wish I would have died when I tried before to end my life.........beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Sometimes I just don't feel good enough.
 Sometimes I just want to cry.
Sometimes I want to scream. 
Sometimes,  despite my support network, I feel so alone.
So many people around me, caring for me, doing there best for me and I feel alone. It doesn't make sense. I've been called selfish numerous times but I don't understand how. I always feel like I'm not good enough. Someone else can be me and be a lot better at it. I wonder if I would be missed if I was gone. Sometimes i feel so black inside that i worry that the blackness is going to seep out and let everyone know I'm broken. I am broken.

I truly hate myself right now. I have no friends and cannot talk to my partner of 20 years as he doesn't do empathy.  One of my major problems is that I can never see the good in other people and find it difficult to say anything nice to anyone. Words come out of my mouth and I immediately regret them.
I suffer with depression but I am coming off my medication as I don't feel it's helping. 
I never feel good enough. I think this comes from my parents as they never encouraged me to achieve anything only telling me what I wouldn't achieve. Also at school I had problems and was never encouraged and people wonder why I hated school. 
 I have made up illnesses in the past which have resulted in long stays in hospital. I don't know why I did this. 
I want to stop my current behaviour as it is so destructive but I don't know how. I just want to feel better about myself and maybe have some friends that I can share my thoughts with

I'd just thought I'd tell everyone a bit about myself, I;m Tiffany and have had severe chronic depression for the last 12 years. 10 of those years medicated.  But, I am also a Registered Nurse, I know the 'effective' measures to deal with depression almost like second nature. None of these were working for me and I'd start feeling like a failure for not being able to do simple things. A small portion of my brain told me what I needed to do to get better, but the much bigger, much depressed part of the brain said 'why bother' and has won numerous times.
So Instead, I decided to write a blog entry and document every day of my life for 100 days. To see if there's a pattern, specific stressors that remain constant, I dunno. But I thought I'd give it a go (I think I'm up to day 7) haha. Id thought I'd share here too incase someone out there is feeling just like me. BROKEN.

I am finding that I getting increasingly frustrated that I cannot find the ability to share my thoughts and worries with a 'friend'.  That I do not have a friend to share with; to listen to me.
Of course it is my own doing that I find myself in this predicament - been without real friends all my life. Perhaps due to social anxiety, perhaps due to who I am. 
Of late I have been feeling progressively less well in terms of my mental health.  I go to psychiatrist and psychologist all too regularly.  But frankly not getting real progress there, and that is really frustrating.  Although I enjoy talking to psychologist. 
My partner is great, but I am fearful of burdening her further, as she has really started to struggle with my illness.  Not surprisingly perhaps, she can't understand that I am not getting better.  After all this time, the medication should have done its job and I should be back to 'normal'.  Have tried explaining the (often) usual reality of mental illness; I will (hopefully) get better, but I will always need to mange my illness.  For this view I am told I am a defeatist.  All this not exchanged in anger, but in discussions between partners.  So, to avoid burdening her more, I am gradually keeping more of my feelings and thoughts to myself.  Although I thought I had retired it, the mask has well and truly come back out of the box I threw it in.
As a result, I am starting to feel the burden of not being able to share my thoughts with someone special, a friend.  
Replying to posts in this forum certainly helps a lot.  When I started it was very therapeutic.  But I need to also share with someone I can eyeball, to see their reactions and body language.
Haha - that feels better now that I have vented.  Thanks for reading (if you did).

I just wondered,
Is there a chance you can get depression by living with depressed people? I don't mean ""catching it"" but I am in a relationship with someone who has depression and I'm starting to get down, cry and not feel like myself anymore.

For a while now I have been having terrible trouble concentrating on things,  For eg reading a book - this is very difficult for me at the moment.  I struggle trying to read a book.  My psych has given me some reading to do on Mood gym but do you think I can remember what I am reading? - NO.
It is very frustrating because I have to go back weekly to him and let him know what I've read.  I get angry with myself because I don't like what's happening.  Could it be because of my depression, anxiety and BPD?  
Has anyone else had this problem? And if so, what did you do to help with concentration/memory?
I sometimes feel that my pysch doesn't believe me when I tell him that I don't remember things.  I don't know what to do, hope someone can give me some advice.
Thanks

My thoughts are whirling round my head trying to express how I feel. This cycle of ups and downs we all talk about  is not good enough. Taking pills to make us feel better and then not being dependent on them. How is that different to any other kind of drug dependency? And more to the point, what benefit do we get?
The glib answer for the cause of depression is the chemical imbalance theory. So why can we not change that balance and keep the balance right? Various vitamin deficiencies and other deficiency conditions require taking medication but at least it works. What's so different about depression if chemical imbalance is the cause?
So that's not the answer. The next step is psychological counseling. The way it is practiced it takes years to work effectively. Learning routines for managing thoughts, motivation, tiredness and all the other ills of depression is ridiculous. Depression is called an illness, so where is the cure?
This roller coaster of good and bad days just reinforces all the negative feelings. Don't get attached to the good days because a bad day is lurking just round the corner. I don't want to spend the rest of my life forcing myself to get up in the morning, do chores, exercise, eat. I want to get up feeling great, happy to be alive and generally enjoying my life.To enjoy the feeling of solitude without dreading being alone. To be equally happy in the company of family, friends, work colleagues and all the people who come and go in our lives.
Sitting on my backside believing I am worthless despite evidence to the contrary is a waste of time. Being aware of our various faults is fine. Being consumed by them is not. And yet we are urged to think about the past and find out when we were injured in some way so that we can 'come to terms with it'. Why not be taught that 'bad things happen in our lives' and then learn to forget them and live in joy and wonder as we were meant to.
Why do we not care for each other when we get sad?  'Oh no', we're told. 'You've got to do it on your own'. If you break your leg you get a cast of some sort put on. Get crutches to help you walk. Possibly have some hospital care. People help in the home, physios work their magic on your leg and eventually you walk unaided again. So where's the support for mental illness.
Well you get periodic counseling from people who have no experience of the condition. Family and friends are too scared to even ask how you feel much less accept that you are unwell. And that's it.

Hello everyone or anyone, today is another one of those days where I am not feeling well (mentally). I'm always feeling sad and anxious about things and I hate it. Worked today and I had a bad day so maybe it's a trigger. Work can be so stressful. Life can be so stressful. I hate it. I'm sick and tired of feeling like this. I'm on medication and I thought I could start cutting down but I'm starting to feel that I cant and what's worse might need yo increase it. I just hate my life atm.

 Hey guys, just wanted to introduce myself here and hopefully find some interesting people to talk to who might actually understand me!My name's Sarah and I have always lived under the shadow of mental illness. My father was clinically depressed which developed into some kind of psychosis by the time I was a teenager. It was incredibly challenging to live with him and I left home at an early age. He committed suicide when I was 19 and since then I have been involved in fundraisers for BB and raising awareness of depression and suicide prevention. Anyway I have always been worried about developing these kinds of problems myself. I am pretty sure I don't have depression or bipolar, but I do have really intense moods that affect my daily life. I find that I will get really upset or really happy over the smallest thing. People always tell me I'm hugely overreacting, and I know I am, but I can't stop it. I only get short moods, like they will last for a day or two and then I will be myself again. I'm also really impulsive and make huge snap decisions, for example I will quit my job or end a friendship just out of nowhere, because I felt like it at the time. I even moved to another country once, just on an impulse because I was bored. Just got a suitcase and flew off and didn't come back for three years. I'm always scared that one day I'll get the impulse to commit suicide. Other people don't do this stuff, but I find it really hard to explain to medical professionals. They always tell me it's nothing and make me feel stupid for going to see them in the first place. My friends don't think there's anything wrong with me either. When I'm in one of my moods they get mad at me and tell me to stop it. I'm interested in hearing what you guys think??

My first post here. Not really looking for any help / support in particular. I just need to say my thoughts.. Get it out of my head... So it stops swirling around and engulfs me.
I lost another friend today, someone that i cared for very much, someone that i loved more than anyone else, someone i thought understood me and would always be there for me.  This is not a lost love story, this is real life! I predicted the outcome over a year ago, when we became friends.. Its always the same. I push them away.. 
Too intense was the final response and that i need to back off from them.  I have always spoken the truth openly, i think it saves time, misunderstandings and misinterpretation in my relationships. I ask if im unsure of my effect on friends, i clarify responses and actions to save anxiety and tension. But as always this is the reason people are attracted to me as a friends, the qualities they first admire, a straight talker, not mincing words, always truthful... These become my downfall in the end. My constant need to make sure things are ok, that i havent offended, been too truthful, or tactful.. This is what they end up dispising in our relationship. 
And they walk away

I never thought I would join a forum to share my deepest thoughts and darkest truths but this really is my last hope at trying to save myself. I don't want to make this all about my history, like many my childhood was far from wonderful and I have no doubt that it was the early years of my life that set me up to be what I am today.  I am now middle aged and lead a completely double life.  I do all the standard acting, smile when you should, say the right thing, be supportive and caring, be the go to person for everyone else, the strong, reliable, responsible one who helps anyone with what ever is needed.  I am constantly aware of my behaviour, body language, speech and reactions so that I always come across as how I want and NEED to be perceived.  The reality is though that I am falling apart inside, everything in my world is a struggle but never will I talk of this, not to my husband, adult children, family or friends (I don't really have friends, never let anyone get that close to me).  I spend my life supporting everyone around me and making sure they are all happy and well taken care of so for me it would feel like an incredible weakness to share my problems with them.   Honestly, they wouldn't understand, they would be totally judgemental and no doubt quite angry about some things.  Which also wouldn't work for me given I hate confrontation.  During the last 40 yrs I have done therapy, spent time in a psychiatric hospital and taken the medications. The therapy and meds still continue but are no longer enough to get me through.  I have completely ruined my life and those closest to me, my life is one big lie, my husband has no idea of the person he is married to, my children have no idea of what I am,  knowing will serve no purpose so that part of me I have been successful in changing but it's the other things I need help with.  Behind closed doors i am always in a state of depression and quite suicidal, I feel like my world is closing in on me but I can't share this with anyone not even my therapist.  I feel like a total failure and am so so tired.  The other thing is that I have financially ruined us over all these years.  We have lost our home, have debt galore and are now heading into crisis mode but still no one knows as I can't stop the need to protect them from sadness at all cost.  So what do I do from here, my own thoughts are just too irrational so I have turned to you all for some advice :)beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I was discharged from a psychiatric hospital a few weeks ago for major depressive disorder. When I was in the clean, structured and encouraging environment of the clinic I was able to track and monitor my thoughts and feelings. Now I'm back in 'the real world' I feel like the physical clutter, the number of people I engage with in a day, and the lack of structure, is pushing me back to a place where I struggled to function.
I can think of all the things that I could do to get me out of bed, but I have thousands of ideas and millions of thoughts related to them. They race through my head so quickly and I can't seem to slow down and hold on to one. If I had someone to come in and patiently give me direction i.e. ""Do some breathing...now pull your feet over the side of the bed"" etc. - I would slowly be able to do it. But when left to myself, I can't. 
Does anyone else experience these racing thoughts?
Has others had difficulty transition from hospital to living at home?

I am a lost soul. My relationship has been on the rocks for a number of years and I've just been clinging on with my finger tips which in turn reflects my life. I have no family, no friends. Yesterday I told my partner who is working overseas that I just can not do this relationship as it stands anymore. That was with the help of alcohol which seems to be my best friend. I work in a Government department which is secure but with rents like they are I would be homeless and i dislike the job anyway. The only comfort I have is my little furry dog which I will lose shortly.
I have taken the day off work today as I just can not face anyone. No one. I'm so depressed. This has been the situation since my partner went overseas to work and now after last night has consumed me like a favorite blanket or a hug just when you need it from a dear friend.
I'm not sure where I am going here. I don't know how to explain how my heart just feels so bloody empty. How do you feel when you know that you will be literally on the streets, depressed, angry and so damn frustrated. Nobody cares, nobody will even notice. My heart feels like it has bled out any semblance of care and is left with nothing.
I'm very sorry to burden anyone reading this. I suppose I just needed to get my feelings out before I can't anymore. Thank you for bothering to read and listen.

Hi all,Everyday I wake up feeling useless, negative and pointless. I struggle to see the light in my own situations but can so easily help those around me. Not many people know I am depressed because I pretend to be happy around all of those that know me. I am currently on anti-depressants and try to meditate a few times a week. Every time I feel like I am moving forward, something will happen which will bring me down. From the outside, it seems like my life is great. I do have perfect friends, loving parents and a great job. But why am i still depressed? I just need help, well lots of help because I do not want to live my life feeling lonely and rarely happy. My friend committed suicide a few days ago because he was suffering from depression. I know I won't get to this point, but I just want all these bad feelings to stop. It is wasting my time and my life. beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, but here goes.
 I'm not a naturally happy person, I'm not bouncy and I don't get excited about many things but a lot of people around me do. There's recently been a birth in the family and everyone is giddy and cooing and while I am happy for the parents and the new sprog, I'm not as happy as everyone else. I do love them but I don't feel the urge to be around them 24/7 and tell everyone I see about the new baby. 
This makes things very difficult because while everyone is running around happy as Larry, they see me and think I'm angry or depressed because I'm not acting like them. This does make me depressed because then they start trying to suppress their own emotions for fear of offending me or they start getting angry at me because they feel like they're bothering me, so I try and reach their level of enthusiasm but its exhausting and things can quickly become a fight because I can't keep up. I try to limit how often I'm around people but that just makes me feel lonely and I miss a great deal of what goes on in my family. I hope this all makes sense.
Basically, I don't know what to do, It's a constant cycle and I need to break it somehow. SO how do I fake being bubbly and enthusiastic like everyone else around me?

I don't know why but I have woken up and started crying (story of my life
That's all I seem to do lately is cry, think of something and cry. think of my childhood and cry. 
I have so many unfinished things that need to be completed but have no motivation to do any of them.  And then I feel guilty for not completing them and feel horrible, lazy and feel that I just can never finish something, to actually complete something. For eg. my eye pillows, I bought the material and the lavender oil, i sewed up the pillows but haven't bought the dried lavender. So now this project is in a bag and it will stay there forever. That's how hopeless I am, never can I do anything that I can finish.
I have all these grand plans but never once do I go ahead with any of them.  I don't have the strength or confidence to tell myself to just do it. Get up and do it. If pnly it was that easy. i haven't walked for a while and i need to. i know i do but just can't face the idea of going for a walk. i just stay inside and hibernate.
i now have three days off and i don't know what to do, i am crying.  i actually have a bbq lunch to go to today but not sure now if I'll go. 
I have so much pent up anger, hurt and emotions running everywhere.  So much happening in my life right now i feel like i;m going crazy.
i wish there was someone right now that could just sit with me and give me a hug. but that feels like a child. damn the tears are flowing ad i can't stop.
need to go, this is too hard, everything at the moment is too hard

I was rejected before I was born. ""A mistake"", ""an accident"". When my mother told my father she was pregnant he kicked her several times in the belly in an attempt to abort me. Because I was unwanted I was made to feel like there was something seriously wrong with me, even evil, that didn't deserve to live. So I was always an underachiever and had no motivation to even try. Always felt like, and was treated like, the black sheep because I was very withdrawn and quiet. Was always the prime target for bullies at school, receiving even death threats. So I began running away a lot, and even though I wasn't breaking any laws the 'authorities' warned my mother that I would be ""institutionalised"" if I didn't ""conform"". So when I wasn't at school being bullied and threatened I had to be chained with a length of chain locked around my ankle with the other end locked to a steel post in the middle of the room. By the time I was 15 I had very little sanity left and was admitted to a Psychiatric hospital for ""treatment"". I looked younger than my age and the authorities, in their great wisdom, put me in with grown men, and therefore I became the target for every pervert and pedophile in the place. By the time I was 16 I seriously wanted to end my life. Thus the life-long depression, anxiety, panic attacks, no self-esteem, and suicidal thoughts.  Whenever I tried to raise any of these issues with my mother, who is now 84, she would just yell, ""I did it for your own good!"" To date she has never said she was sorry and never will. My conclusion is that I must've been evil and deserved everything I got, and never ever deserved life.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

It's getting late and I'm tired (always tired).  But I just had to say to somebody/anybody, I was on such a high last week, I had so much energy and I was happy and grateful.  It is such an unusual feeling for me that it is almost scary, I had the audacity to think that maybe, just maybe, the worst was over, the menopause was nearing the end, the depression/anxiety and OCD was all going to exit out of my being and leave me in peace to try and live what's left of my life in relatively normality.  One week I had that for, sheer bliss for one week.  Now I'm back to the ""dark place"", that is which ""normal"" as far as I go, the depressed, tired, exhausted, painful, hating, sad, pathetic shell that I am.  The worst thing about the rare burst of ""happiness"" is the fear and realisation that I will and do come crashing back down to here, to this place I'm in again, it always seems worse.  I'm so tired I can hardly lift my fingers to type this.  That is all I can allow my mind to cope with saying at the moment.

I don't think I'm after advice; but will accept any. I just have nowhere to vent without family/friends interfering. I have suffered from depression from as long as I can remember. I have had 3 bad cases of PND; lost my first husband to Melanoma 20yrs ago; left my 2nd husband {& 2 young boys} 5 yrs ago.  My ex & kids are now about to move back to our home town {4 hrs away} due to financial pressures. I love my boys dearly & the thought of them leaving is killing me; BUT; I also know that in reality I am NOT capable of looking after them on my own. ATM; their father is an on call casual & I get called to come stay with boys at a drop of the hat....and this sends me into a downward spiral...they don't behave for me {they are 10 & 15}; they are rude & call me names & I get in trouble if I discipline them....damned if I do & damned if I don't.  I have a new man in my life {for 8mths}...all started out well; but he doesn't believe in depression & is one of those who say ""suck it up & get over it""; which; of course; is making me worse. When my ex & kids leave he will be all I have as all my friends have busy lives with kids & husbands of their own.   I have always said that I am too silly to do anything silly to myself; but there are more & more days that I wish I wouldn't wake up or hope something happens to me {I don't want to leave my kids with the guilt of me committing suicide}.  I AM SORRY FOR RANTING; JUST NEEDED TO PUT IT SOMEWHERE. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hello, I can't remember a time when I wasn't depressed. There have been times when I've experienced happiness but the depression has always remained just beneath the surface. I often have a facade of being a joking and jovial type of person but inside I seriously want to die. All the Depression Self-tests I've done show that I'm in the Very High bracket physically, emotionally, andsexually abused as a child, with a very controlling mother who chose to chain me up like a dog (this is the truth), did not do a lot for my early development. Since about the age of 16 there hasn't been a day that I haven't thought about death and wished it would come quickly. If not for the fact that I'm a gutless coward I would've taken my life a very long time ago. I honestly don't think I can be helped because it's something I've had my entire life, it's a part of me.Thank you for reading my post.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi guys
I've written on this forum before - once when I was despairing, once when I thought I was recovering.  My recovery lasted about 1 week and then I came down hard.  Since then I have been in bad pain.  I'm writing again because your kind words really helped last time.  
I've sought and received a lot of help over the last 10 years.  I'm usually able to respond pretty well to treatment and advice and so I used to think my illness was well-managed or at least well-tolerated. 
But something changed last year.  Perhaps because I no longer had the security of a good job, or the comfort of living in my home city or had a very supportive girlfriend, but when another episode commenced in about August, I have never been more frightened.  
 The last 12 months have been a long series of debilitating lows, fused with painful anxiety.  
Right now I'm in the middle of a horrible low.  I have been told to be patient.  I'm really struggling with this.  How can you be patient with horrible pain?  I feels like I'm sitting on a hot plate and being asked to stay still.   I have this deep pain in my chest and in the back of my head.  It feels both empty and tight, kind of like a black hole sucking everything into nothingness.  To give a final analogy, it feels like I am wrapped up in barbed wire - if I stay still it hurts, if I move it also hurts - maybe more.  
 I know I need to be patient, but how can I be patient with this when it just hurts?  
 I would really appreciate any advice you guys might have
Thanks guys

Hi everyone,
Just signed up, have been looking for somewhere to vent for a while.
I'm a 27 year old male and while I've never been diagnosed I think I have been suffering from depression since I was around 14. It was about 3 years after my parents split and we moved two states away while my dad moved to another country and I started drinking heavily. Not just the weekend party drinking but drinking at home, hiding alcohol and marijuana which I used almost every night and continued to use to deal with my emotions through university, and I still do today. Sometimes I'm absolutely fine for weeks or months, then something tiny will set me off and I wont sleep for days due to stress and a feeling like I want to tear the world down and sink into a black hole, or get so numb that it doesn't matter how I feel. I've spoken with a GP who was very blase and basically told me that life is sometimes ""difficult"" i.e. dismissed. I have since moved and changed doctors but haven't yet felt much like taking to my new GP about this kind of stuff.
Anyway I've been struggling for the last few days due to some stuff at work and just needed a place other than my girlfriend to vent. Not sure what else to say, just feel like this is all holding me down and pulling all my friends in around me when I'm feeling this broken. But my life is actually pretty damn good, I enjoy my work and my friends. Most of the time. Other times I feel there's absolutely no hope for myself or for humanity or our planet. It's been over 10 years and I still cope by using marijuana, and I try not to drink as much but I still have a drink or two almost every night (sometimes a lot more). I just wonder if feeling this way ever ends or is it something you learn to deal with and overcome over time. If its the latter, that sucks, but ok.
Also thanks for creating this space.

I've been writing this morning in my book to my psych  about my ""inner child"".  I started writing about my childhood and writing myself as a third person.  I started writing that I hate my inner child for what I have gone through. How weak I was and still am and noboby cared about me as a child,
She was brought up in a very strict background where she wasn't allowed to go anywhere, have no friends or not even go to a friend's birthday party when invited.  She was never allowed sleep overs or even when she turned 18 she was never allowed to go out. She had to stay home and do what her mum would say.  And if she tried to say something back to her mum she would be yelled out.  
She had swimming lessons as a child and clearly remembers not being able to swim so what did the instructor do - push my head down the water. this would happen over and over again. Hence now I hate putting my head under water.
She wanted the love from her parents but she was not ""smart enough"" like the other siblings who would get all the attention.  She was punished a week before her wedding because her mum and dad had organised something that she wanted to do but was told not to go ahead with my plan. She was 20 yrs old
How lonely it was for her at school, only 1 close friend and not even allowed to go to her house. Everyone at school at groups of friends - I had none. She must have been an ugly child for no one to want to talk to her, no one to walk home with her.  She craved to be a good child at school and always ""acted dumb"" so then she could get the attention from her teachers. Maybe that's what she was wanting - attention and love from someone, just anyone. 
And all she wanted was a hug, a kiss and a loving supporting parents; all she wanted was to feel loved.  Maybe she never got that bond of love because she was born 10 week prem and was left in hospital for weeks and weeks.
I'm sorry I needed to vent this I am so emotional today, my thoughts are everywhere some good and some not so good. Just want to be left alone. Lump in my throat, anxiety is high.
Why did I write this - I don't really know
Jo

Hi,
More than anything I'm just writing to get things out. I dont really feel comfortable or able to talk to anybody, and that's the main problem. I guess I should start by stating I know I'm depressed. I'm a young adult, and I've been in and out of depression my whole teenage life and it has been really tough. This time though is one of the most tough, because for some reason I wont speak about it. I don't think I'm looking for advice, more just to hear from somebody who has experienced or is still experiencing this. 
It's been a few months now since I've started feeling depressed again. I was depressed at the beginning of the year, and ended up going to a psychiatrist. For reasons I don't really understand I cancelled going to any of my appointments and I have stopped taking my medication. The medication made me feel more tired, because I felt like it was 'pushing' me through when I didnt have the energy to do so. People started noticing how I was feeling, but honestly I don' t remember what they said. About a week ago I 'broke down' into tears and confessed how I was feeling to my mother, but she told me that I had too many committments at stake. I then spoke to my sister, who let me stay with her for the evening and cancelled my shifts for the day. The next day though, everybody expected me to be better and continued on. 
 My problem is that I feel like the world wont stop moving, like I am on a conveyor belt and even though I am overwhelmed I can't make things pause so that I can catch my breathe. Each day I need to go to work, be there for my partner, do my study. I feel like there isn't the time to stop and get help, or that if I open up about how I am feeling everything around me is going to collapse.I feel like nobody cares about me, or that it is my fault and I am over reacting and just need to 'grow up'. People have started getting short with me, yelling at me for not talking and calling me selfish.
I tried to make an appointment with my doctor but he is on holidays. I'm worried that if I speak up about how I am feeling people are going to make me cut my shifts or make drastic changes. Even worse, they'll tell me they don't do 'crisis care', and that I need to go to the hospital. 
I know I am walking on glass, but for some reason I just wont seek out the help that I need, I tell myself that I need to keep going no matter what.
Has anybody else felt this way, and what did you do? Do you have any advice, or could you relate at all?

Sometimes ( most of the time ) reading through these posts makes me feel like even more of a failure. Many of you have, (or had) partners and kids, something I haven't experienced for a long time (partner) or at all (kids). And everyone seems to get their life back on track after not too long. I don't feel like I belong anywhere, not even here. Nobody truly knows my loneliness.

Ok, so right now if feels as though my world is falling apart. My one friend sent me a message about about a month ago with the whole 'I miss you, let's catch up', and I am yet to hear a thing since. I'm lonely, and miss her as well, but the depression just stupid me from doing anything. It's the usual story though, she gets a new boyfriend and no one else really matters.
 Being stuck with no friends and depression just makes me feel stuck. I throw myself into my work and do a good job everyday, I bust my guts for the company (even my bosses said I do a great job), and yet last week during end of year reviews I got my bum kicked hard over a trivial matter, and the 2  blokes I work with only work when the boss is in his office and they got raving reviews. I use work as my outlet and now it just seems pointless.
 Each weekend I am curled up in bed,  I don't know what to do. I am over this depression thing. I am at a complete loss with everything.

I have suffered depression for years possibly as a consequence of losing both parents at a fairly young age leaving me to bumble through life on my own.  I have experienced all those cliched expressions, the dark tunnel, the deep hole, the black dog, I have often contemplated ways out to end the suffering, there have been days when making the effort to shower and leave my house to walk the block to the supermarket have seemed almost insurmountable.  But I seem to be somehow resilient, even when I really want to quit I seem to get through and try as much to live in the moment, I feel like I am constantly swimming with my head just above water.  Over years I have developed an inability to enter into a relationship, I have no confidence and have often failed in my ability to be able to determine if a person is decent and good or not so I choose now to live alone.  The one thing that has helped me the most are my pets, my cats are a reason to get up and function, to feed, to groom, to clean litter, change water, to play with and pet, to just pet on the couch. I adopted a rescue dog, I class as one of the (few) best things that have ever happened in my life.  She makes me feel happy and I know she loves me and I love her, for twelve months after I got her, for the first time in years I felt free of depression, I barely recognised this feeling but I was always aware that just like an alcoholic who no longer drinks it (the depression) would always be lurking.  It came back eventually, insidiously creeping in to cloud my mind and take over my heart.  Today I bought a puppy (I don't expect I'll be able to 'cure' my depression by obtaining an animal every time I feel sad :), I brought my pup home and we sat in the sun, this particular pup is a breed I have wanted to own since I can remember. It made me realise that in the whole of my life I have only ever twice fulfilled any of my dreams, for as long as I can remember I have always wanted a pup of this breed to train in agility and I had always wanted a touring bicycle.  I have spend (and wasted) so much (too much) of my life living for others, giving to them, making sure they are alright and have what they need, I always thought that if you gave it would always come back to you, my giving only left me empty, untrusting, peniless and bereft, no wonder I have been sad, now is time for me.  I have always wanted a horse of my own and to tour and potentially live in Tasmania, those things are next on my list :).

I hate that when I think I'm getting better, something will happen and I'll just revert back to how I was. I don't see the changing I claim to have done when I'm on a high. It feels like I have to get times of sadness to compensate for all the good times I've had. 
Am I alone in thinking this?

Hello To All, This is all new to me so I'm not too sure how it all works. I have been incredibly down lately, finding it hard to communicate with others around me.I feel as though no-one, either professionally or personally seems to take me seriously. While I have support of family, I still get the ""just get over it"" impression from whom ever I pluck up the courage to talk to.I've been diagnosed with depression for a number of years now but recent turmoil in my personal life of late has caused great anxiety. I find communication a great help but folk in general aren't interested in talking about true feelings.I can prattle-on four hours just as good as the next person about the weather and other insignificant topics but am too afraid to discuss the real issues for fear of being classed a freak. How do you tell someone who has never suffered depression, anxiety the overwhelming feelings of dread, how you really feel.I wish not to put a dark outlook on things but I would be really interested to hear others' experiences. Maybe some advice or hints on how to deal with myself and other people. Thanks, Jerry

4) I hate the fact no matter what treatment I try everything seems to get worse.
5) I hate it when the people around me rejects and abandons me when I need them most.
6) I hate that I have been bullied by professional’s the people who I supposed to trust most.
7) I hate the last 6 months of my life it has relay been hell 
8) I hate the fact that I am haunted by the images and thoughts of self-harm and suicide on a regular bases although I can control the urges and know I never do it.
 9) I hate that I am alone in this fight and no one is with me. 
10) But most of all I hate the fact that I cannot longer fight this on my own and I need all the help I can get.....

I would have preferred to chat online with a counsellor, but as I am overseas apparently this is not allowed on this site. Seems they think only those currently in Australia need help...When I was 19 (I'm now 47), on a wet, dark, cold Sydney night, I came close to taking my life. I was a very messed up kid. After some time I  went home. I feel like I've been on borrowed time since then. 28 years later I'm beginning to feel this borrowed time may be at an end. I'm still a messed up kid.I've filled those 28 years with a lot, most people would say I've lived a life. I've spent close to half that time overseas, travelling, living, working, volunteering. Loved and lost and loved some more, women from a range of different countries. Managed to finish a degree and get myself a pretty solid, well paying career. And yet at no time at all have I felt ""grown up"" or stable.Done a pretty good job of suppressing these feelings a lot of times. Going out with friends, drinking, travelling to new places. All the distractions your could imagine in the world. But focusing has always been an issue. Doing anything long term the same. I get bored very easily, and since heading to South America 3 years ago and earning money from working online, I simply don't think it would be possible for me to live a ""normal"" life again.But now financial issues are coming into play, once again something I have been running away from these past 3 years... but you can only run so long and so far. So time to pay the piper, but I'm thinking it might just be easier to call it a day. I'm no closer to being an adult, being responsible, being able to form any sort of meaningful, in depth relationship with another human being. I can form plenty of fun-loving, drinking and dancing relationships, got friends all around the world. And they are friends, it's just that I am incapable of really letting anyone in. And at 47, maybe it's just a whole lot simpler with this and the money and everything else to just... well, thank the powers that be for the extra 28 years I got out of life, and just move on...I head to Buenos Aires for a wedding in a few weeks, and will spend 4 or 5 months there, and perhaps that would be a great city to call it a day...beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I want to put it out there.Last Wednesday morning realization hit me like a ton of bricks in regards to my Parents and the lies that had been told by everyone around me. I spent the next two days crying and in bed. By Friday I had hit rock bottom, thinking that if I had succeeded in my suicide attempt in July this year I wouldn't be feeling this way. I was feeling numb and empty. I knewI needed help. I presented to the ED department and I was assessed by a member of the mental health team 7 hours later. By this time I had started to calm down and didn't want to be there. Thankfully a member of the team kept in contact with me over the weekend but I was managing to keep my head above water.Sunday and Monday I managed to start feeling slightly better and started to dust myself off and regain control of all the negative thoughts and feelings.Today, I woke up early and went and walked along the beach at sunrise trying to stay in the here and now, not easy as my mind goes at a million miles an hour. I sat on a rock and closed my eyes for 10 minutes breathing and trying to clear my mind. When I next opened my eyes a whale was breeching about 100 metres out to sea.

I have been with my husband for 16 years. I was diagnosed with depression during my pregnancy with my second child 4 years ago and despite trying countless treatments have only slowly gotten worse. My main concern at the moment, as per the title, is my complete and utter lack of libido or ability to achieve any sort of arousal. There is nothing there. Zip. Zero. Nada. I feel numb. Has anyone else experienced this? What did you do to improve the situation? I am at a complete loss. This is tearing my marriage apart and I don't know what to do. Please help.

I am feeling very stressed, crying and not too good. Depression is so horrible, i hate it so much. I have a shocking headache - all I want to do is hide away forever and ever or to run away as fast as I can and never be found. Going to bed after i finish here, my head hurts.
There is too much on my mind - this saturday is the auction of our home.  I am stressing about finances again, work issues and I feel I am not coping.  I need to tell someone that i am not coping, my head hurts and i just want to go away. I had a terrible emotional day yesterday at the hospital doing a session. Everything seems too hard at the moment.
It's day 10 of not speaking to my mum or dad - see they don't care about me. I may as well go, not thinking  need some sleep

New to Beyond Blue and hope I am able to shed some light & help myself also...21 months ago due to backyard accident, I sustained severe head trauma, resulting in hospitalisation & rehabilitation and a late diagnosis of Dissociative Amnesia in where I lost my entire and complete memory, which also led to  severe depression. along with other issues....I remembered no one in my family what so ever, not my children or siblings or even my partner, or my life but due to my family and my children, they were able to fill in the blanks for my medical team of my past history of depression, which I found out I had suffered on and off for many many years....Most recently due to dissociative amnesia, my depression has a strong hold, and often there are days when walking out the front door is just not an option, I would shut myself away from the world and refuse to talk about things..I had problems dealing with just day to day  stuff,  relearning my life  how to walk, look after myself, relearn about the world outside, relearning  technology, learning about my past life and discussing it....and that was my worst enemy!!... I had no memory of my past life and what I did learn or what I had memory flashes of I had not dealt with in the past ...so they were carried into the future, which along with D.A has caused my severe depression..So...relearning how to open up and try to explain exactly how and why I feel this way is not easy....why you feel you are in a deep darkened hole unable to see any light above let alone found a way out....I was very lucky to have my daughters help and found a very lovely GP with a mental health back ground but still my biggest problem was trust and dealing with my depression by going on medication ( which at first I refused to do as I was unable to grasp the concept of what had happened to me....my hardest battle besides the D.A. is  remembering to trust people enough to be totally honest with how I am coping and confide in them with my daily battles...Opening up and trust is a massive step, some days are darker than others and some days getting out of bed is a struggle, I honestly know that without the help & understanding from family, friends, mental health team and specialists I would be in a darker deeper hole with no way out at all....I do know its a constant battle but its a battle that can be won with trust and the right people on your side....talk ...talk to who ever will listen to you...get it off your chest..open up....

Hi all,


I've been 'lurking' on the forums for a while and I love reading everyone's
posts and I've learnt so much and it's been heartening to discover I'm not
alone in that so many other people's stories resonate so much with my
experience.


I suffer depression, but I've never sought professional help for it. I
manage OK most of the time. I have a pretty good quality of life on the whole
and I can’t complain much. I have worked out some strategies for caring for
myself through the tough times.


But one thing I hate about depression is that I think it turns me into
someone I don’t like and don’t want to be. It makes me negative, pessimistic,
cynical, a bit mean even, I suppose, down on people and situations, assuming
the worst. And that’s not me at heart.


I was talking to someone today about a mutual acquaintance who was described
as someone “very genuine” and “who doesn’t have a mean bone in her body”. And
this girl is, she is truly delightful, always has a kind word to say.


But the comment just struck a nerve with me. It made me feel old and mean
and horrible, and grieving for the old me. I used to be like that. People would
describe me as someone without a mean bone in my body. Even now, I’m hardly an
“awful” person, but I just long to rediscover the ‘real me”, this girl who is kind
and sweet and friendly and a good friend. I feel like she’s gotten lost along
the way!


Many thanks


xxx

Well have been suffering from a depressed state
i made my way to doctor to try and get help after talking to friend. 
The doctor put me one medication the first 2 week where hard but stared to feel stronger in myself after 3 weeks my doctor increase the dosage. Then all down hill I had trouble sleeping even if I did sleep felt like I didnt. Felt like something was in my head. I don't want to eat because of hunger but becouse of pure tast so just want sweet and salty food. I returned to doctor after 3 weeks on new dosage doctor said need to stick with it . 
I have felt my life get more down and foggy I have exteamly vivid dreams I wake up and think it's realy then few times I have been at work and I have felt like I'm some where else (feels like 10 min but no one notices) so get confused what and where I'm. 
As I was unhappy with my doctor so I decided to try a new one he basically was confused what I wanted he said you got medication you will get better stick with it. So again I feel like there no help.
after a few weeks I opened up to my friend that not having luck with doctors so she recommended one so here I go again. He sound very understanding and ask questions and was genuine and said that medication need change from evening to morning. And also had blood tests for few basics so after one week felt had some better sleep got my blood results back nothing out of ordinary. So I asked for further help so he said he would send a referral away and they will contact me it's been like 3 weeks. 
Mi feel like I try but don't get anywhere I just feel like want stay a sleep and dream of a better life :-(

We have quite a large community here. So many people suffering depression. Most have several symptoms in common, lack of motivation, worthlessness, sleep and more sleep, moodiness and the list - well I've only scratched the surface.
Sadly (and I wont ignore it) many mentioning they want to give up on life. And of course, that there is nothing left that  stimulates them. Yet, this is so totally wrong. We know in our hearts and logic that there are things you can do in life that will leave you breathless with excitement, place a smile on your face for days with you ringing all your friends to tell them and some experiences that will be lifelong memories. Yet for the deeply depressed this sadly is all irrelevant. Either their depression is so deep they dont want to even entertain the ideas or physically they are drained by meds.
What I want from this thread is for you to dream, to open up your cloudy mind to what is possible when you are in the depths of sleep or despair. As you lie there in bed have simply thoughts, simply plans to chase those experiences when your cycle has run its cruel course.  
So you wait till then. And a day comes when you are feeling not bad. you look at your partner and tell them to find the nearest hot air ballooning business ""we are gunna fly"".  Or hire a speed boat, light aircraft or helicopter flight, lunch at a revolving restaurant anything for that ""buzz"". Totally out of your comfort zone? you bet ya.
On the wrong tram? tell me, criticise me, suggest anything, talk, say it, I dont care, I am willing to take anything on the chin with this. Frankly, I will do anything to make progress with one person and I hope that person is you. Why?
Because yes, I've been there, I've come out the other side and managed my depression to a more stable level but I never forget those times and I will fight like hell to never return there. I want you, the reader to do the same, to travel on the same journey I've endured, to hold the hands of your family and run with them ....into the sunlight as one, laughing and loving.
You will not give up hope. You will wait for that day of calm and end of cycle peace to arrive and you will show that black dog where to go. And your partner/children/family members will look at you in awe, because you would have done activity that is not parallel to the symptoms of your illness. You will do it because you can, you will never give up. Your kids will love you for trying.
You will fight like you've never fought before.

Hi
Does depression affect decision making so badly that when presented with an opportunity to come out of it, I cant. The mind become so negative that cant see any positive even in the best opportunity and then decide against taking it. It is terrible, what to do?

Hey all, I'm 31, 2 kids (9 and 4, both autistic).Diagnosed post-natal depression aged 24. Depressed from age 15, anxiety from age 5.My son's therapists when he was being diagnosed with Autism said that I would be diagnosed Aspergers (now autism) if I'd been assessed.      I've just come out of an almost-9 year relationship with a guy, who got more and more verbally abusive and controlling as the years went by, and escalated to his worst once we'd split (almost 3 months ago now). He finally moved out 2 weeks ago.  I also lost my close friend around the same time - she got angry because I was being ""selfish"" and focused on fixing my life after my breakup, rather than ""being there"" for her (she also has depression) and sent me a hate-filled letter blaming me for her feeling suicidal.  So that's my basic story. Lots more to it, but that's the main stuff.  My depression has been medicated on and off for years, my last medication was about 2 years ago. I've been coping reasonably well without it, other than the last few months since the breakup. My new boyfriend is amazing, but he just doesn't always seem to get that I can't pull myself out of it. I'm trying, I really am, but it's not that easy. Granted, I do a lot of things that make my depression worse, like read the blog of my ex-friend. It's almost a compulsion.        The thoughts of self- harm are hard to ignore, but I AM ignoring them. I' m not suicidal, but self- harm has been one of my coping strategies for years - it's been about 5 weeks since I did, and before that it had been about 6 years.    My depression is by no-means under control, but it's under control enough that I don't do anything silly. I have days where I cry and cry, but I can pull myself out of it enough to have a semi-normal life. And my kids are always well cared-for, even on my bad days.  Hi all :)beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I have been interested in a support group for a short while and think joining a forum would be a good way to start. I have had depression and anxiety my whole adult life .My father had the condition - so it is hereditary. (My sisters have had it too and we have talked in the past, but is not something I feel I can discuss with them further.  I had recently come off my antidepressants a couple of months ago which I 've been on for years (far back as 2000 when my mum passed away) and feel I can manage without them, however still have things to deal with and I feel it is helpful enough just to vent those issues to others who would understand and may even feel the same way.
I have a husband and 3 children (youngest 15) but feel very alone with no one (esp female) to talk to. My daughter is now living overseas and can only mssg her for support but don't want to burden her as she is only young. I don't want to burden my friends either but they u/stand I have the condition.  I feel they are not exactly like me and like or don't like the same things as me. What I really want is somewhere to vent my feelings and be reassured I am normal.
Anxiety has been an issue at times a bit more often as I've gotten older and have irrational anger my whole life that occasionally flares up but I manage this now by teaching myself to control it.  I have issues and always want to know people just like me (same as soulmate, if you like) that have the same likes and dislikes of what can also be trivial things. This makes me feel
very alone not knowing people who feel this way and then I question
that there is something wrong with me, again adding fuel to my low self
esteem.   I have been a perfectionist my whole life which more often than not is good thing.  
Don't know where else to start but love to hear from others who feel the same.

I was diagnosed with depression today; I suspected that I was depressed but now I feel like a failure by actually admitting it! Crazy thoughts I know, but its hard to get that stigma out of my head. I have always had to be the strong one in my family. Other people see me as tough, practical with a common sense approach to life. It was extremely difficult to admit to my husband that I am suffering depression & it seems that I have been struggling with this for many years, but just didnt realise it! I am embarrassed that my tough outer shell has finally crumbled & I am dreading it when any of our friends find out. I dont think that I can cope with the gush of ""love & pity"" that I am likely to get, nor with the knowledge of the whispers that I am emotionally unstable & cant cope with the pressure etc. You see, I feel guilty because my husband has just commenced aggressive chemotherapy for cancer so I should be the rock for him - not the other way around. I know that my parents in law will think its all an act; that I resent the fact that hes getting all the attention but that is definitely not the case. I want more than anything to be able to support him through this journey, but just dont think I can...

Dear BB Administrators
Thank you for your emails. It's nice to know you care enough to monitor the messages. I have tried to be hopeful about myself and to respond to the people who write in here but I feel I only give the wrong messages. I cannot respond to other people's problems anymore. All I do is cry over their pain. I cannot even manage my own difficulties. 
I don't know what I am going to do. I am hanging on to see my GP and ask for some help. Maybe she can help me live with what I feel is a gross betrayal.

what if you cant cry anymore. There are no more tears to shed. Anger is not the resolution as your not angry. What happens to your state of mind. Do you accept the circunstances and try to make sense of it, or sleep hoping it will go away. We cant depend on others to make us happy, belong somewhere, think of our consequences, actions and train of thought.  We seek advice and up goes our medication doses. Isnt there any proper diagnoses for all our symptoms.  Im tired of being called unreliable, lazy, worthless, you just sleep all day. You have no future, think about your health, destroying people around you, Get up , get a hobby, excersice, eat healthy..... well its called depression, Bipolar1 &2 anxiety. We think alot but have no energy or mind set to do anything. When mania everyone loves us. We are then normal.  Then they welcome us back. How can we forget about the past. The past is our history which makes us feel the way we do today. We look into our past to solve our problems. Only then we will be releived of our burdens and move on. The past haunts us fear causes anxiety why?  Are we failures in what we do...or were we abused for years and now believe it..... I can go on, on, on.    Yet depressed, bipolar,mental illness  people are still judged. As we are the crazy ones or scared of us because we are very angry and never know when we will attack.   Mefications help us but no one knows. People dont talk normally they just agree because of mental illness.media has to get involved. Not only beyond blue fans bike rides. This is serious people have to  now more about it. Like smoking,  gambling,

Hi everyone
First off, I think you're all amazing people to give support to strangers.  I know i lurk around the internet when I'm feeling particularly bad and out of ideas, but if I get well I'm off trying to lead a 'normal' life again and pretend that this bad patch never happened. After years of getting sucked back into it, you'd think I'd learn right?  I'm obviously a pretty slow learner.  
So I moved cities last year to take on a pretty big challenge - going back to uni at 30 to do a really tough course, which is totally unrelated to everything I'd done in the past.  I had a really good job before that, although I always felt that nag of dissatisfaction and the sense that I should be putting my energy into something more worthy.  So I took a big gamble leaving my company after nearly 5 years, and having been up here for about 20 months, it's dawning on me that I lost.   

I started finding it really difficult after about 6 months, after 8 months I stopped being able to enjoy or relax on weekends or holidays, after 1 year I stopped being able to think clearly, and after nearly 18 months my mind and body have just given up.  I was attending the compulsory activities but was mentally a shattered wreck.  I got in touch with the course administrators, who very generously have allowed me to take 12 months off, and now 3 weeks later here I am.  
I've been treated for depression on and off for 12 years, and it got ramped up by a psychiatrist this year, who thinks it's a bipolar II disorder.  To me it's just pain.  I don't think I've ever had it this bad.  Things look terribly bleak.  Being someone who needs a plan, and to feel like they know where they're going, I'm  
not 
coping very well feeling this lost.   

I just have no energy for anything, and I don't think I'm ever going to again.  I feel like I've been doing everything I can to get going again - seeing psychiatrists, seeing psychologists, spending time with friends, eating well, exercising, opening up to people - but every effort I make just leaves me with a sense of  
failure.  Everything I do now feels futile, pointless and ill-conceived.  The dreams I had are now in complete tatters and I feel destined to give up on everything, eventually. .  

My mother came up to visit me and she eventually broke down in tears after I explained to her how much I'm hurting.  It breaks my heart to cause this pain to others
I appreciate your reading - I know you'd like to help but I don't think anything can.

Hello everyone     I do not really know how to start this so if I’m jumbled up please excuse me.  I have been dealing with depression anxiety/ difficulty socializing with anyone in general for a bit over 3 years and lately it has started to become more and more of a problem. I found this site and decided to do the test thinking id pass no worry’s after doing the test I got a 35 (high) which has got me thinking maybe there is more to this then I thought and maybe my thoughts are not normal.  This is not something recent either I have been having these thought / feelings for over 3 years now in which time I have lost most my friends and have lost a few relations because I feel as tho they do not care and that I do not deserve to be happy.I have trouble even looking for work cause I feel that it is pointless. Most the time I don’t want to interact with people I would prefer to be alone as I cant seem to feel any connections with people anymore.   I want to seek help for this but I have no idea where to even start and even if I did I have been training myself to make sure no one can see it and I’m worried that if I go to seek help I will try and hid how bad it is and look like I’m lying or over reacting. All I know is I want to be able to interact with people with out feeling as if I do not deserve it I sick of constantly feeling down I want to be able to feel and be happy again. Even now I feel like my explanation is me over reacting every time I have seeked helped so far threw friends or family I just get told to man up:/.

For some time I've been depression free, almost fooled myself I it wasnt coming back. Of course we do this all the time, a life of hoping and dreaming with that dark black dog shadow lurking, watching and sniffing, waiting for his chance to pounce.
And in these past few days what accompanies my depression is a mix of sadness and depth that I find hard to describe even to myself. Usually never lost for words I suddenly have few. Then a dear friend rang me and I blurted out my current condition and she asked me to write it down.
BEFORE THEY FALL 
It not matter about me and my health 
Nor my money and perceived wealth
It does matter if my friend wants to call
Can I dry your tears before they fall?
 
And if you let me please do
Talk about your issues and what bothers you
us that have problems every hour of the day
do understand when your mind is in decay
 
 
You might walk slower than you often can
Doubting yourself like this mixed up clown of a man 
If you are in distress and need some hugs and ears
It not matter but can I dry your tears?
 
I carry a bucket with me everywhere
I dont care if the world is full of stares
I'll place it at your feet any time you call
Can I dry your tears before they fall?
 
A simple poem. That's me when depressed. Recently a thread was here from a member about how sad stories might contribute towards increasing depression. Although this thread is sad I dont want it to be. What a contradiction that last sentence was!.  I am off for 3 days tomorrow camping. I'm hoping by Monday I'll be well.. So right now I've decided to start that weekend off, reboot my attitude, change direction and be happier. It's a tough call, can I do it? Yes, I will. Damn it I will.
 Here is my start.
A SIMPLE POEM
It's when I worked for Telstra I had a bit to say
Before I entered a porta-potti on a bright and sunny day
It was the type on two wheels for workers where they'd moan
And I decided during this time to write a simple poem
 
Upon this dunny seat where I do my bit
An interesting episode of where my botty sits""
 
Well this dunny on a trailer was towed by a fellow mate
And off he drove to the shop and mi' mouth was just agape
With mi' undies at mi' ankles and the seat wrapped around mi' neck
I tried to stop mi' tender arse from sliding off the deck
 
The slop began to lick my bot, sloshing from side to side
I yelled and screamed for him to stop so I could restore my pride
 
""Upon this dunny seat where I do my bit
An interesting episode of where my botty sits""....
Tony WK
 
I've made the first step.

I have tried to be a good person all my life. I have made decisions to avoid contributing to many of the things that I have always known are terrible burdens on this world. I have never doubted the choices I have made were the right thing to do, despite the effect it has had on my personal life. If I could go back and do it all again, I honestly can't imagine what exactly I would choose to do differently. But my choices has had strong influence on my personal relationships, my employment, my day to day life. I have always been seen as strange and stubborn by others, from strangers to the people who love me despite.....what I am. I have struggled to find my place in life, in this world, in this society....and to date I have failed to belong to anything, at any time, in any place. People have told me that I have failed to learn how to ""play the game"", I cannot deny this. As I believe that good people ""playing the game"" is one of the strongest factors about why so many things have become so terrible for so many people in our world. I have never wanted to play, for me it has never been a game. It hurts me to be a part of this place. The pain is....tangible. Even in moments that I enjoy, even in those times I can successfully distract myself the most, even if only briefly....that pain is always there. Haunting me.As I have gotten older it has become more difficult to hide....more difficult to pretend that I am ok. There are disappointments, moments that happen to everyone, just a normal part of everyday life, that when they happen to me now they can tear me apart. It is not any individual thing by itself. Even the worst things that have ever happened to me by themselves would be easy to deal with. But combined with everything else into the monstrosity of pain it has become. The smallest thing becomes overwhelming instantly.I have hurt since I was a  child, and it has progressively become worse over time. I am 37 years old....and I am tired. It is not about wanting to die, or not wanting to live....I just desire the pain to stop. Simple, it's not complicated. I have done the anti-depressant thing. I have been to the counsellors and the psychiatrists more times that I can count. Done group therapy. Changed my diet, done exercise, joined sports groups.It's killing my mother...who couldn't possibly deserve to watch this happening to me any less. It's not fair to her at all.I am so tired. I' ve had enough, I've seen enough....I don't want to see any more.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Of course you can't tell me the answer to my purpose, per se, but how am I supposed to figure it out for myself? I've soul searched and cannot come up with a point. What's the point to my life?I'm not suicidal, I don't want to die until I'm an old lady, yet I have still found myself writing out who I want my belongings to go to when I pass, and hurting myself, as if it will be next week! I am confused at why I keep feeling so down. It hits like a Mac truck.I feel stuck in a job that I have lost passion for, but that everyone tells me I'd be stupid to leave as I'm about to clock up long service leave, and they have an amazing mat.leave policy for when my husband and I decide to start a family (in the next few years) which makes me feel stuck. It's not the job I want to do, but the job opportunities are next to none for a woman my age in my town.I'm studying a general uni course (Bach Arts) part-time (reg. job 4 days a week) because I don' t know what else to do/what I'm passionate about, but I want a degree with the hopes it'll get me a better job. My grades are starting to slip. I've let myself go the past 6 or so months and the weight is creeping on. I've gone from an active, 3-4x a week at the gym, kinda girl who this time last year triumphantly ran her first 10 kms (after forever declaring I'm 'not a runner'), to coming home from work, sleeping and watching TV and basically not moving at all every single night.My sleeping pattern is all over the shop. I won't go to bed until quite late then wake up early, but force myself to sleep as long as I can because I can't bear to face my closet thinking of what I can wear today that won't make me look pregnant (even though I'm not, but everyone is harassing us about it and my weight gain has people whispering), and wondering how I can structure my day so that I can speak to as little people as possible, because the effort of pretending I'm 'normal' is so hard.I'm just confused. I have great friends, supportive family, wonderful beautiful loving husband, great job with perks (despite feeling 'over it'), and I'm an ungrateful, lazy, whingeing , who can't be happy with my lot- then I feel guilty and shameful that I'm feeling yuk about my life.  I'm thankful for this safe place to unpack my mind from time to time, even if it is non-sensical and makes me appear to be a vain, silly person. These feelings have intensified since my mother-in-law passed 3 mths ago.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

You know the ironic thing about depression?  It's the really happy days that follow. .. I feel wonderful today,  hopeful even.  But what about the people that I hurt when I couldn't pick up the phone to talk to them? What about the customers that won't come back because I was in such a hopeless state that I couldn't give them the service that they deserved.  Those are the thoughts that remain in my mind in the aftermath of depression.  I feel like a fraud, because I know that it'll return and the cycle will start all over again.  It's so baffling. ...

I have had severe depression for 14years or so, in the past year I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and am struggling to come to terms with it. It goes through phases where I can ""normalize"" myself but other times I crumble over the silliest and smallest of things.  in the 14 years I'vesuffered; I've gone through bulimia, anorexia, self- harm and OCD. I still sometimes struggle with SH, and that is when I know things are getting bad again.  i work in quite a stressful environment, and really have to stop myself from getting angry or crying at work. I just feel so angry and worthless. I don't know if I should attempt to change jobs to something less stressful where every decision is on me (this thought creates anxiety attacks thinking of change..) or do I just reduce my hours? If I reduce my hours I then worry about the financial stress of doing so?!  im torn with what to do, today is particularly bad. I'm stressed, tired, angry, dissociated. I struggle to pay for psychological help, and am currently medicated.  Apologies if this makes no sense, venting and hoping it will for someone and they can guide me. In some way or another? Thanks in advance. beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I'm just so over it. i'm sick of feeling good not needed the drugs and help and than bang it hits and i want to give up. how much can a person take?? why cant i do and keep up with what my counsellor tells me it's like i'm scared of being happy actually i dont know what happy is and i dont feel like i deserve it. all my friends have their awesome realtionships and kids and i've got me and my mind in my room alone. i want to like myself and than maybe i might find a guy that likes me but it's sooooo  hard.

Hi BeyondBlue, After reading some of the threads here, I decided to post and seek feedback. I have been diagnosed with bipolar for a decade, but after reading the forums, I am beginning to think I show much stronger signs of depression. I am always ""coming down"". It has taken over my weekends, my job, I struggle to maintain friends because sooner or later they get distant, and I've scared off so many people with my behavior and tendency to be inconsistent, negative and destructive. I am anxious and self conscious alot of the time. I have very few hobbies outside of work because I'm depressed enough not to be able to get into activities, and I have trouble navigating basic directions, functions, get lost easily etc. I have sought professional help and medication without any luck so far, and I have suicidal thoughts on a weekly basis.This is a hard and dysfunctional existence :( beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I have read many threads and I took these and my GP and pyschologists advise about telling people about my depression. However, when I told friends they gave out an uneasy laugh and stooped the conversation and the ultimate let down was my company that caused my depression won't let me come back to work and offered me a small some to walk away. This has added to my depression and put me right back to where I was 2 months ago. So my advise is to only share with like for like people as others are still in the dark about depression.

Well I'm new to this site after watching some mental health shows this week on tv and seeing some very familiar signs.I experienced some heavy fog today at the office so I decided to search online and found a depression check list. Well this certainly rang home, the sadness, being withdrawn, numb, feeling unwanted, the little things set me off, feeling of being judged. The tears just come from no where with no motivation to want to work. I feel if I feel off the earth no body would even know or care. For years I have felt like this and never knew any different. I'm not one for self diagnosis but depression really seems to fit. It can't remember the last time I felt happy and laughed. I certainly don't believe I have anything worthy to offer and my life has run its course .beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hey everyone, I hope this finds you well.I just wanted to write to SOMEONE because feeling depressed makes me feel as if I'm alone and can't talk to the people around me. It's so weird because I feel like I'm isolating myself, but I cant seem to help it? Anyway, I just wanted to write and complain - hope that's okay. I just wanted to write that Ifeel brittle and broken and that I'm taking everything to heart. I had a disagreement with a best friend of 8 years a week ago and I can't get past it. It was something straight forward and if I was 'well', I would have shrugged it off and marked it down to a miscommunication...but this time, I keep going over and over and OVER it in my head and every time, makes me feel worse and worse. Physically, I feel sick to my very stomach. I don't understand it, but that disagreement has me crying all day, not sleeping at night and yesterday - even contemplating suicide because it hurt me that much. I honestly feel like I'm going crazy. I tried to talk to a friend (someone who knows us both) to get a wise opinion on it, but that friend just had a go at me and I took that to heart, too. I feel even worse having sought out help. Am I going crazy? I dont know how to get past this. I struggled getting out of bed this morning because I was awake all night going over every negative word my 2 friends had said to me. I don't understand why it's affecting me so much and along with depression, I have now developed a fear of hearing anything else from friends that might hurt so I have stopped talking to anyone. I can't live like this :(beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

There's just some darkness inside that I cannot reveal...
Because they tear me apart with their ugly  truths that lay concealed.      
Iv known this darkness all of my existence and even I  have never gained peace from their pecistance. 
So you see I have no choice but to withold from you.. because I fear that what this darkness says is true.    
There's so much I wish I could say and have you chase this lifetimes darkness away...  
I don't just not say because I'm fearful.. I don't just not tell because I love you.                
But to protect both the lover and the loved.. I withhold the powers within this silence and place you happily above!

Hello,
Not sure where to post this, so moderator, you are welcome to move this thread to another appropriate slot?
Has anyone seen the Mental As screened by ABC TV. I am not sure if I am happy with the way those with mental health issues were portrayed. Yes, perhaps they want to cover a whole spectrum but why don't the powers to be, includes people who suffer from depression but can still function daily at home and in the workplace.? It is true that I may not be as productive but I was still able to work and contribute to the family income. I didn't claim any disability allowance or any social security benefit. 

Seeing the program makes me ashamed to let people know that  
I 
suffered from 
depression. It is no wonder that there is a stigma attached to depression / mental health issues.

I started suffering from depression as a teenager and I still do 10 years later. I've been on meds, I've seen doctors and everything your meant to do and I do good for about a year and then hello it's back again. I'm tiered of it and trying to treat it. Maybe I'm just not meant to be happy. Why should I keep fighting something I'm programmed to be? This year has been the worst. I've been married for3 years to my high school sweet heart. we decided to go on a holiday and on the second last night I got very ill and ended up in the hospital to find out I was miscarrying a baby I never knew I had growing in me It was the worst pain ever to instantly fall in love with something that has left me and come to terms with itAfter the loss I went to friends for help but of course people fail you and I have found myself with out my best friend of 15 years. I found my self to get more quiet and pull away from my husband. I'm just detaching myself from the world. But I think I've detached my selfs to far. I'm board and lonelyI have no friends. My husband and myself are people of faith and high up in our church and every single day I feel pressure to be perfect. I can't keep being perfect anymore. I've been the good perfect virgin church going girl since I was 14 and all I want to do is go to the clubs get so drunk, expreament with drugs see what it's like to be with another man & live a lifeI feel so horrible saying that though because my husband is AMAZING! He loves me so much and worships, encourages, loves me every day for who I am flaws and all. But I'm board, I'm sad and lonley. I feel I got three options, sit it out hope this goes away, or fake it and keep everyone around me happy. I could end my relationship, watch my self hurt the love of my life and be a failure to my family and love with guilt. I will have fun for a whole but I know I will end up sad. Or just end my life and hope people will slowly forget about me and I don't have to watch people get hurt  or feel hurt and sad any more. I sit in bed every night just thinking how easy would it be to end it all. I convince myself I should do it. I literally have to hold the bed so I want get out of it and end my life because I know there are other ways out but I'm tiered of the other ways I'm so tiered I really just want to be free and I don't know how to be free anymore. I feel so dead inside. I don't feel like the real me is alive and I hate that I really hate thatI just want to be normal beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Well I feel like I've finally achieved my unconscious goal. Waking up to reality and realizing that over the years I successfully worn down all my friendships,  alienated my family and actually have no one to turn to and talk, rely on (although I know I should really only rely on myself) and just be around. I've been trying to hold it together for so long and im so upset, I couldn't even hold it at work today. The tears just kept running down my face at my desk,  I had to go home. I really hate myself right now for letting it get to this, but I just don't know what to do anymore

I feel so alone, I feel so ugly, I read so many help books on how to love yourself but I can't seem to find the right solution. I'm 38 years old and I've been in recovery for almost 18 months now and I'm very proud of myself. But,  without the mask of drugs and alcohol, I really don't know myself. I don't have any friends because I'm so anti social, my social skills suck because I'm not comfortable talking to people sober. I really want to enjoy my new life but it seems all do is get angry or cry all the time. I was recently dropped from my insurance so my depression is at an all time high, all I think about is what's wrong with me and my life. I'm sure this isn't the way I should be living.... I'm just so sad all the time.... thanks for listening.

Hi everyone, 
I am looking to find some support or advice from other long term sufferers . It would help to know that there are others who have battled with this and continue to keep on keeping on.
I'll share a little of my history and some difficulties I am facing now. I have suffered bouts of depression since I was 8 . If it happened before then I can not recall it. I am now 28 and still fighting to keep on top of managing life with depression. My first thoughts of self harm were at 8 and I suffered major depressive episodes regularly after this. I went undiagnosed up until the age of 18 when I spent time in a mental health ward after my mother called the police for assistance as she didn't know what else to do. As the years go on I am finding it harder to pick myself up from my little moments, as I call them. They occur at least once every year and seem to be getting a little worse each time. I have started suffering from anxiety along with them, which I feel is coming from the dread I experience when I sense my efforts to fight back an episode aren't working well. I am currently hitting a major low point but have finally taken the steps to seek help that I should have done a long time ago....the problem I am facing is that I feel so exhausted from the compiling effects over the years that I am doubting my ability to fight back to better times like I usually do. My little box of hope I draw upon to build up my positive thoughts feels empty and I'm not sure where I'm going to get the strength to fight this time. As my thoughts wandered to places I normally don't let them go to tonight I thought I would come here and ask for suggestions from others that may have found them selves where I am now. My question to you all is how did you find strength when your supply of hope was dwindling? And what helped you to get back on track.

I am 59 years of age, a survivor of  anxiety and depression. Currently, I have hubby who was also diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Out of interest, does both conditions naturally go together?
Of course, now I find myself being the 'strong' one, trying to support him as best as I can. I thought I was his caretaker but a member here said that I shouldn't label myself as a caretaker. What is the definition of a caretaker, I wondered?
Early this morning, I received an email from my nephew who sadly informed me that my older sister is dying of cancer. So, now, I find myself in a pickle, what shall I do? What would you do if you were me?

hi everyone  at 58 and wondering how it made it and why.  my life has been a maze of relationships and expectations from everyone else.  I am intelligent and a leader by nature  yet I have never found anyone that actually cares about me  sort of a contradiction really.  for the last 20 years I have just tried to get through life and over time find I no longer laugh and feel anything except emptiness and isolation  I am a rational person with logical approaches and I feel that due to my  sex (being a woman) people cannot accept that I can think.  it is very difficult to explain how that feels and I know so many people would be more comfortable if I just acted like a woman and left real thinking and ideas  to the men.

Hi I'm new here. I'm a twenty something health professional with a pretty 'normal' life but am finding it harder to deal with how I am feeling. Since I was a teenager I have always felt unhappy inside (suicidal thoughts were prevalent during teenage years but I know it would never eventuate) however I lead a pretty 'happy' life. Did ok in school, got into a profession my Asian parents are proud of (and I am of too I guess ),  recently engaged with the perfect partner of 12 years... but I'm finding it hard to confide in anyone.  I have mentioned to a couple of close friends and my partner whether they think I might be depressed but they don't think so and seem to just dismiss it. I am fully functioning,  just am never happy inside,  but have days where I feel like there is no purpose and feelings of low self worth etc.  I have also found that although extroverted, im gradually disliking social outings, particularly those with my fiances huge group of friends. Im not very good at articulating myself but just wanted to let it out to someone. I am afraid to seek help and for now am just seeking some self help first. Sorry its all muddled but I Guess its a Start.

i have been struggling on & off for 15 years with melancholia, having 3 severe clinical depression episodes, one lasting a couple of years...lately i feel that i generally function at 80%, which i suppose is better than not functioning at all, yet i can't seem to get past that point. the main reason is i still cannot accept the past & choices i made long ago. in my mind i can accept where i'm at but i just have been not able to quit the 'what if' thoughts, & i really need to be able to do this to overcome my emotional paralysis. help!?

I feel really odd these days. I walk through the world yet it seems I am not part of it.  Things happen round me but don't impact on me. I am going to stop seeing the psychologist for reasons I cannot talk about. Maybe I am so afraid of this happening because he has been such a wonderful support to me and really helped me when I was in despair. 
I feel I can't talk to anyone except my GP who is on holiday ATM. I have been ill and maybe I have not yet recovered but this does not explain why I feel so disconnected from everything. What a load of babble I am writing.

Hello everyone,a brief, i have been jobless for over years now, trying but nothing seems to work, i am 37 male, single, live with mother and sisters, and nephews; family tension is always there. and it is frustrating. i am creative, and i am pro-photographer, this gives you an idea that i pay attention to details.I for as long as i can remember worry a lot,to an extent that it gets to me negatively, even when i was a kid, i remember to have stomach spasm after my school exams.2 years ago, i suffered, from what i found was Depersonilization or Derealization, due to smoking a couple of puffs of weed, some told me, it is not that, and the over all was stress. but it went well after that...as this feelign started fading away. lately,i am being consumed by fear, fear of illness,death, and i start analyzing everything that is happening in my body...   i suffered my first anxiety or panic attack last week,and it was scary, did EKG, blood tests, everything was normal,but cant stop thinking of it.. visited a  neurologist, who told me that i am in early stages of depression, he gave me dietery supplements,and medication to help me sleep.but still, i have this foggy head,tightness in my chest, i feel like something is holding and strangling my neck,something holding that back of my head,and still worry about everything,and honestly i am becoming creatively pessimistic in all aspects of life.I am a religious person, and suddenly i start asking question that i can not answer,which creates this kind of being in a dark alley feeling, then thinking about my health,then thinking what;s happening to me? am i going to stay this way? i wasn't like this before,...i want o my old me.and it frustrates me when i try to talk to someone and he tells me it is all in your head,and you can change your situation, as if i i happy with i am in now, and i want it.been through a lot lately, i don't know if it depression,or anxiety. will it change when my life style changes... its just that i feel down, and at times, i feel ok (and i will be very happy), and then boom, down the drain i go again.sometimes i feel i wish i am in dream and snap out of my mood.i dont want to be this way, i want my old me back . Maybe i need a few words or maybe i just want to let the steam out.thank you for your time :)

Hi Everyone,


I thought I'd start a new thread as the other one is getting a bit old now.


I'm writing again because although I'm not crying in heap quite so much anymore I am still suffering with horrible depression, anxiety and now I've started feeling really angry. I'm not sure if others can relate to this. Sometimes I feel like my anger is a way of coping because it's easier than feeling debilitated and crying all the time. I think it is also a way of 'dealing' with the emotions of being let down by people. It's easier to be angry and close my heart than feel the horrible pain of being betrayed and abandoned. I'm also not eating much and am drinking and smoking more than I should. 


My partner is amazing and I feel so sorry for him having to deal with my issues. My mum is going through a lot of her own problems and is really busy so I find it hard to talk to her. I have always found my dad to be a great source of calm but again I haven't been able to talk with him. Every time I go over there's someone else there or something happening. I guess I just feel alone. 


I'm still going to the support group- some weeks are great, other times not so much but always worth going. I just feel like so many other people are improving and having breakthroughs and I'm still in this darkness. I'm still not 100% comfortable opening up as I'm not the best with talking to strangers but sometimes I manage to offer advice and it's good to just be around people. Still seeing the spiritual healer/hypnotherapist which is going ok- not sure how much it's helping. 


On the positive side I've started going to the gym most mornings. Even though it's so difficult to drag myself out of bed at 5am I still want to go. I do feel better for doing this but some  days are better than others. I have cried a few times either at home or actually at the gym if no one else is there. Pathetic I know but it's getting some emotions out. I've also been trying to say hello to people I see in passing and even made a friend while sitting in the park. A nice lady came and had a good chat with me so that's something I suppose. 


Anyway I hope that everyone is keeping well.


Speak soon,


Laura

Hi I've never done this before, I feel like my spirit is broken.  I worked for a pastor in a church as one of his lay pastors.  He was meant to be a mentor not only on the job but for life.  Turned out he was a narcissistic, controlling manipulator - who did everything he could, passively or aggressively, to break my spirit.  He used the other two staff there to do his dirty work aswell.  My wife and I had moved back to australia for this job, but was the worst 18 months of our lives, and I'm speaking from experience.  I battled cancer not that long ago, with six months chemotherapy.  The following year after that was black year.  But with a ray of Sunshine, the job offer working for this pastor.  I fought my way out of there, he did everything he could to manipulate and control us into being stuck there.  He also happened to be high up in the denomination hierarchy which wasn't helpful.  Turned out a lot of the hierarchy know what he's like and watched me move there.  Ringing for help, I received not much.  Now I'm politically not a good person to talk to, soI've lost friends and more.  I was ripped off of 8 thousand dollars aswell. I now can't get a job and feel completely as if my confidence and self confidence is completely gone.  I almost committed suicide a few weeks after resignation.  Have fought through the last few months, have a job in government lined up - but just can't see the point anymore.   Disillusioned would be an understatement.  I'm angry, depressed, stressed (with little money) and just want to call it quits. I have been to counselling but didn't do much.  Just can't believe I'm here and feel like I won't get out.  when i was at school, I was voted as the one most to succeed in life.  I played in the first XV rugby team, was a captain and played guitar and sang at shows around the place.   I don't see why I should bother with life anymorebeyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work online (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Where to begin.  I’ve struggled with depression for around fifteen years.  It’s been a struggle to say the least.  I was abused emotional/verbal/psychological by my mother.  As a visible minority in non multi-cultural small town, I’ve also experienced high levels of racism.  When I was younger (late teens/early twenties) something inside of me knew that I couldn’t start my life until my family issues were resolved.  I swallowed my pride and starting seeing a counsellor – one of many to this day.  At that age, I was very ashamed of not only the change I was feeling internally, but I was also very ashamed of the dysfunction that was occurring at home.  My counsellor naturally suggested that I ask the family member who abused me to join, but unfortunately she was unwilling to acknowledge the truth behind what was going on, at that point in her life.  This made me not only feel rejected, but it communicated the opposite of what was preached at home (being accountable and resolving our issues).  I started having suicidal thoughts and would play-out vivid fantasies of ending my life.  As the thoughts of suicide got worse, I ended up sharing with my parents.  I knew I needed emotional support, but it was something they we're unwilling to give at that time in their life - I believe they were in denial about the effects of their abuse.  I remember crying for so long, I felt like I completely drained myself of both my tears and emotions.  I struggled with violence, promiscuity, drugs, and alcohol throughout my twenties.  I’ve tried many things (prescriptions, psychiatry, counselling, anger management); I’ve wanted nothing less than to lead a normal life.  I used to get so upset with myself, because I felt like I was unable to control my emotions and just 'get over everything' (I’d randomly break-out in tears; and often felt emotionally fragile and weak around dominant personalities).  I was constantly getting bullied/targeted at work (I suffer from extreme anxiety, which makes me come across as either weird or snooty).  I ended-up losing two jobs in a row and decided to take a year off and just write/focus on getting better. Within the last year I've rededicated my life to the Lord.  I've decided to fight the spirit behind depression and started opening-up about this illness. My dream has always been to write a novel, so I've decided to write a story about the struggles of depression.  I've started my journey of facing down the issues behind my emotional scars.

I was officially diagnosed about 9 months ago, but have suffered with depression on and off for a much longer period. My 'black dog' presents itself as waves of crippling sadness, emotional outbursts and tears for no apparent reason. These instances then make me think negatively about many aspects of my life, pulling me deeper and deeper into the darkness. I often have problems sleeping (nights are the worst for me) and rarely have much of an appetite.
I have chosen to be very private about my illness, and have only confided in my partner. I've become very good at hiding my depression. However, my condition now leads me to doubt my relationship with my partner and second guess everything. I hate being so down all the time, I miss feeling joy and happiness in my life and I am scared I am losing the ones I love because sometimes I just can't face the day, and they confuse this with me being disinterested or choosing to be alone. I am finding it increasingly more difficult to be in social situations, as I struggle to find anything positive to say about myself, and I feel very uncomfortable when my friends talk about how happy their lives are. 
I no longer enjoy my job, and obsess over even the smallest negative situation. I want to escape this dark prison. I am sick of this constant weight bearing down on me. I want to enjoy life again. I do not want to take meds, but would welcome some suggestions for coping methods to get through the dark days.

Hi there,Some of my earliest memories at 6 or 7 years of age include my parents yelling exhausted that ""I'm only being miserable because I enjoy it"" when I couldn't stop crying. I got stuffed toys when I didn't cry for a full 2 weeks after things were too much. At high school I saw various psychologists in and out of school, only to be told by one ""you definitely don't have depression"" before they'd even assessed me, as I was in a rare good mood and able to be myself, and the others focussed on the typical teenager things like friendships and parents. I was really mad when a friend of mine got mild depression in year 12 so got to miss out assignments, when I was told I didn't, despite all the times I'd sat in the corner of a room bawling, trying to harm myself, or hid in a dark cupboard to cry. This girl was going through a teenager phase of dying her hair etc and had never even tried to kill herself, and there was me, with my fully formed plan but just the resolution ""I'll wait and see what uni is like, just hang on a few months longer"" to stop me. Now I'm 20, on and SNRI an SSRI and a mood stabiliser each day but I still have terrible swings of happy (lasting 4hrs up to 3 days) then flat the rest of the time and the occasional 5 day depression fit, complete with bawling my eyes out, inability to function, and again telling myself ""You'll graduate in 2 years, that'll be better"" (not that I don't like uni, but being unable to do what I want or have any people respect me iskilling me) I was only diagnosed last year, by a proper psychologist (first one i've seen). He reckons it has been unnoticed for so long that it will never go away, we just have to keep on top of it by rotating different doses and seeing what works, yet they all fail within 3 months or less, with usually disastrous consequences. Today I had SLSWA state championships, the greatest day of the year, and won a bronze medal which was damn good for our first season as a team. And yet I broke down several times because people were treating me unfairly, like I wasn't equal to them, that I was worthless. They don't mean too I know, but why do it?!? It has made me so upset that I don't think I can go to the after party which starts in 15 minutes, which I have been looking forward to all year. I just wanted to share in case it makes others feel better

Hi There,
I think I need to seek help but I've tried twice previously and both times ended quite badly. I just sucked it all up, got on with life and kept on sweeping feelings under the carpet, so to speak. 
I'm in a position where suddenly everything around me has come crashing down. My husband has just had some bad news at work, my small not-for-profit company I started has fallen apart, my career is all but over and my plan to retrain at university next year is pretty much in doubt because of my husband's work issues. 
Even when in the absolute throws of depression previously, I've always been able to (with much effort) claw my way out, see a light at the end of the tunnel - anything to hold on but this time, I just, there just doesn't seem to be a light. 
I still force myself out of bed every morning, do my work to try and fix everyone else's problems (because they become my own eventually), do what I need to but the whole day all I want to do is go back to bed, I'm exhausted yet at night time, I do everything I can to stay awake - watch tv, play on my phone, you name it, I'll do it. 
 I guess I don't know what's wrong with me - I don't know how to move forward and I'm nervous of seeking professional help again after the last two experiences. I don't know if this will just pass and I'm being weak or whether I should accept I'm not perfect - heck, I just don't really know anymore. 
 I don't even know what it is I'm looking for here to be honest. Thank you to anyone who does reply.

It's 4 o'clock in the morning - the day has not even started.
I lie awake in my bed, gripped by the fear of the Shadow.
I feel its presence just lurking in the darkness nearby.
 
On with the lights, and look under my bed?
No, I don't want to see it. I don't want to find it.
I wish that Shadow away, but it taunts me and it tells me I will never be free.
The Shadow it owns me, for I am its slave.
 
Morning is coming, and I exist yet again.
Nobody doth like me, especially not I. Why would they, how could they, for I am so gray.
Held down by this Shadow in the darkness of despair.
I am so tired of this life, why must I be here?
 
Help do I seek in taming this demonic Shadow
At a time when I struggle to think straight, my mind but a blur.
Tangled inside, and lost in myself, must get back to the light, did I think
Away from that Shadow that plagues my soul and blinds my sight.
 
Before I am free, that Shadow doth return, takes me back into despair.
I thought I could fight it, defeat it and win. Thought I was better,
For I can see hope, and I feel the light, but I cannot defeat it
For confused is my mind; it is stronger than me!  It cannot be beaten, no the Shadow has won.
 
I must break free from this Shadow 
but I am too weak to defeat it
So I bow down to the Shadow 
and it keeps me down
 
I can't defeat the darkness, with anguish all consuming,
I just lay here and let the Shadow take me back to the Hell of my existence.
I am lost.

Well I finally decided to reach out and try talking to people that know what it is like to live with Depression. I have been suffering On and Off from depression for about 5 years now and honestly this time is the worst I have had it. I am at that stage when I wake up upset or feeling over it and then go to bed at night time with the same feeling. I feel like crying but I just cant?!! I have to drag myself out of bed in the morning then 2 hours later I feel soooo tired that I just want to go back to bed but as I work full time I cant always do this. I also feel sick to the stomach all of the time and just feel so off! I have been on medication for pretty much the whole time since I got diagnosed and since things are worse now they have decided to bump it up for a month to see how it goes. I don't feel happy doing anything. I use to be such a happy person that use to laugh and joke and smile all the time and now I feel like I am someone that nobody wants to be around because I am no longer the person I use to be. I don't like anything anymore. I feel like I just want to hide in my bedroom all of the time and not bother with going outside!
I am sorry that all I have written is about how I feel but I really needed to get things off my chest. I find that I can talk to people (non sufferers) but don't get the feeling that they actually know what Is going on. I am interested to hear other peoples opinions and sorry if this thread isn't what this forum is about. I am new at this..

I have been fighting depression now for more years than I care to remember, and it has always taken the same course, that is I find it difficult to do anything and that means anything. Like every one else here I struggle on a day to day basis with just getting out of bed, getting into the shower, going to work and dealing with the household chores. I usually dont want to move or go any where and I don't feel any joy in any part of my life.  I have had breast cancer four years ago and I am still fighting that battle as well, my husband is an alchoholic and my daughter who is only 28 is very ill and has just had two hip replacements due to a metobolic bone disease and now there is complications with that, so I dont feel as if there is any light at the end of the tunnel, but just recently I have found myself very agitated and extremley impatient to the point that I want to smash things and throw things, I yell and scream and get very angry with everyone around me, I have road rage and I find it difficult to go out in public as I want to abuse any one who gets in my way in the shops etc. Has any one else experienced periods of impatience with their depression.
Looking foward to hearing your thoughts on this. - Thanks J

In the past two months I have what I can only describe as plummeted
in to depression. It was triggered by some work my husband and I had
decided to have done around our home yet afterwards I was left feeling like it
was one of the worst decisions of my life and feel constant dread at being in
my own home for no logical reason. 
It started out as anxiety and panic attacks
after the work had been done when I realised I couldn’t undo it but desperately wanted to. I’ve
experienced panic attacks on and off for 9 years but not recently.
The anxiety has retreated somewhat but has been replaced by a deepening depression
and feelings of worthlessness and in making wrong decisions in my life. 
Looking back I know I’ve had depression for some years,
including what I believe was post natal depression after I had my daughter who’s
now 8 1/2 but was much too scared at the time to admit to anyone that I needed any
help or wasn’t coping. Each time I seem to have been able
to pull myself out from the depths of darkness but this time feels
different. It feels like all of the dark times rolled in to one and I’m not
even sure why it has occurred this time, why now? 
I was feeling so scared that I reached out to my husband and family
and started seeing a psychologist which I certainly
wouldn't have considered doing in the past. Telling my family of my depression makes me feel like im burdening them which they say it isn’t but I can see their not being able
to help me is affecting them too. I don’t feel like im making any progress as my
feelings haven’t changed but I do find talking to the psychologist helps, yet is
only a temporary feeling until I get home again and my negative thoughts return.
All of this turns in to guilt. So many people are in much
worse situations, are terminally ill, in bad relationships, have sick
loved ones etc. I have no reason to be depressed. I have lovely children, a
supportive husband, a stable job, my own home which ive just had work done to, there should be no reason to be depressed. Yet im so desperately unhappy.
For a long time ive been busy with full time work, uni, kids after school and weekend activities and a business. I've been functioning on auto pilot for so long but now i dont feel like i can get out of bed and function. My GP wanted to put me on antidepressants but i'm scared of the effect they may have on me and if they will even be able to help. I keep reading that you're not alone but depression really is such a lonely feeling.

Why is it that everytime I do something I stuff up big time??
 I hate it so much that now I am hating myself so much.  I had a session last night with my regular therapist.  He gave me work to do on the moodgym website.  I started last night.  But then I thought I would like a session next week to discuss certain issues I have but never have time to talk about it. So I emailed him last night.  He replied this morning with - no I don't have any appts for the whole week, I will see you the following week and we can put these issues down on a list to talk about then. And he also told me not to email him a reply because he knew that I would be angry with him and he didn't want a reply. Oh yes I was damn angry with him - why couldn't he fit me in somewhere; why does he have to have boundaries; 
So what did I do? - I emailed him back in my state of rage with him.  I asked him if I could then speak with him today.  His reply was no we will talk on Monday. That made me even more angry so I replied back saying that I was so damn angry with him and that I hated him.  (He knows that I don't really hate him).  He never replied back.
So I guess I have to wait until Monday,  It annoys me because I know that my behaviour was very childish, and prob manipulative as well. All I wanted was to talk to him or even better have another session.
I stuff up all the time; maybe he should give up on me for good.

Hi, this is actually my 1st post on a forum like this before so i'll try my best to get my message across.
I have had depression for many years now (was diagnosed at 18 am now 29) i was only on anti-depressants for the 1st year then figured i could manage on my own. i have had my ups and downs as anyone does but the past few weeks i have been having these ups and downs multiple times a day instead of every now and then. 
in the past i was really depressed, approximately 7 years after i was diagnosed, i didn't leave my room, i barely even showered, i lost all my friends cause i was not putting in any effort to do anything. 
about six months ago i finally got away from the place i was living and now live alone in a unit, i have not been happier in a long time, i started seeing a GP again after 10 years and got referred to a psychologist, which i see the 1st time this friday coming. i don't work cause i can't get hired (never had a job so no experience), i have no money to do anything but pay rent,bills and get food. i'm also still a virgin which gets me down at times (try not to think about it). 
Now the past few weeks i have had no energy, i seem to be sleeping in where i never did before, i cry at least daily and i don't even know why sometimes, yes, i'm lonely but i was for 10 years and didn't really care then. i just feel like i am going back to that dark place i was in for so long, i'm scared that i will not ever be happy and get frustrated all the time bout constantly struggling everyday. i tell my sister and the few friends i managed to reconnect with that i'm fine but 1 of them knows i'm not and that i hate lying to my sister about it, i just don't feel comfortable discussing that stuff with her. i hope the psychologist can help me to vent a little cause i have been told that i tend to bottle things up, and i am willing to go on meds again if they help me (my old meds made me like a robot)
 i'm not sure what i am saying really, so confused about everything. feels like i'm playing mind games with myself everyday and my mind is really good at the game and keeps beating me.
just a rough few weeks and felt i had to do something and so here i am, with all you fine people. and i hope that better days will come eventually

Im a 28 y/o happily married guy and was officially diagnosed with severe major depressive disorder when I was 19. Since then, Ive tried everything. Self help books, psychologist, psychiatrists, anti depression medications and everything. Its about 6 weeks since Ive finished another treatment period. Its shocking that Im a physician. I actually finished medschool about two years ago. Im also diagnosed with adult ADHD and OCD. I haven’t killed myself because I strongly believe in after life. I actually tried to find a way out of my faith to kill myself but I couldn’t. Another shocking thing is that I actually have a good life. Just bought my second house, have an average car. My wife is a 3rd year OB/GYN resident, I am the supervisor of medical students’ research in a university and was able to upgrade the rank of student research position of my university from 24th to 3rd in 6 months and this year we’ll become 2nd. If I wasn’t depressed, we would have become the 1st in the country. During the last several months, I don’t go to work regularly and haven’t done anything. The changes Ive made haven’t happened with hard work, only by implementing new teaching methods and some creative changes. Im finishing my mandatory service in 6 months and even though I have good offers of staying in this university with great promotional offers (which I would be great at). But I have rejected the offers until now… I cant find out what to do… believe me, I have done much while depressed and I can do much more (the bar is very very low over here and no one has done anything so whatever I do will dramatically change many lives) if I could manage this disorder but Ive become disappointed and currently believe that it cant be managed at all.Anyone have an answer, opinion or something for me?beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I keep crying for no reason, it's been getting worse this past week, I'm crying for about 10 minute intervals every couple of hours.
I can't stop, I just get this overwhelming feeling and just burst into tears, even looking at my own reflection I burst into tears.
Yesterday I had those heartache feelings while I was crying. Today I have a headache and I've had stomach pains.
I don't want to say anything to anyone in real life in case they just laugh at me, or think I'm attention seeking or stupid. I don't really know what to do...

Never posted before.  But really need to talk to someone . 
Have been diagnosed with depression and ocd. Have been seeing a physhologist for a couple of weeks . 
The Doc and physch have both reccommended Medication.  I have agonised over taken it as I am still giving my 2yo a bedtime breastfeed ( trying to wean him but to stressful right now )
I took meds first time last night and was terrible , got no sleep and woke up a wreck. Uncontrollable crying , very anxious and couldn't function . Was lucky my partner had the day of work . As I was incapable of looking after my son.
Im so scared and dont know how to cope , atleast yesterday I could function  . Scared how the meds have made me react . I have a 2yo to think about and its not fair on him to see me like this , he keeps hugging me and giving me kisses which is just breaking my heart.
Pleaee tell me there is light at the end of the tunnel :(

I think I have come to a startling revelation about myself, or I should say that I have come to a final conclusion. I honestly think that once you are hit with a depression such as the one that I, and many others, have gone though we're some what broken the rest of our lives. We manage and we live with depression but we never truly get ""better"" its kind of like a recovering drug addict or recovering alcoholic. I have several friends that are recovering drug or alcohoics and they... have all said the same thing, we are clean, we are better, yet one little slip, one taste and we will be off the wagon and maybe for good. Its always a battle with yourself and temptation, depression is kind of the same thing. To be brutally honest I think that depression is actually a little harder, I can not begin to imagine the will power that it takes a recovering drug or alcholoic to stay on the wagon, but both the recovering drug addicts and recovering alcohoilics have a great support system. There are meetings like AA and other such things, and when these people be come clean people praise them for being clean and sober for how ever long they have managed it.  But yet when it comes to depression people (and those that suffer from this disease) lay to hard of a judgement on people. Those that suffer from depression are the worst ones when it comes to judging ourselves (I am including myself in this). There is still this major stigma about being depressed as if some how its ""wrong"" or people will look on the outside and say ""Well what reason do they have?""   Honestly its easier to stay depressed then to try to fix what is wrong with in yourself, or at the very least its a hell of a lot easier to just say ""I am depressed and worthless, so why bother trying?"" Depression still has its claws in me, I have my good days, then I have some really bad days, and I still have some major issues that I am not sure if I have the strength to stand up and change or at least work around, such asI am scared to try something new to improve myself because I am waiting for something to come along and rip it out of my grasp like what has happened a lot in the past, either through my own fault or through someone else's fault.  Despite the fear and anxiety I am still moving forward, trying to start my own business, and trying to help others where and when I can, half a step only but its still moving forward!

As an extension of my other thread ""Depression and excercise"" I thought I'd mention this topic of physical restrictions or injury.
It's been on my mind since 3 years ago when I broke my lower leg and was wheel chair bound for 8 weeks. The first 4 weeks was so painful I didnt have the mental idol time to be depressed and I had to worry about my business running. Then it set in as well as impatience to get on two feet again.
The trouble is my physical health is a balancing act. DVT both legs, gout that just wont go away, old back injury (well who hasnt got one?), etc. I have to admit however that I always seem to have the drive to put these things aside in my daily life....well most times anyway.  I suppose I really believe that I am more fortunate than some, lucky to walk, lucky to do most things. But I also admit that at times it gets me down and seems to trigger depression. But that isnt conclusive. My depression comes and goes in short bursts now that I'm stable on the correct medication making it difficult to isolate if it is a trigger or not. This is where I need your opinions.
How effected is your depression from physical issues? Did you have the depression before or after your physical restrictions came about?
Thanks  Tony

I'm a 39 year old man.  I suffer from severe depression and anxiety. The anxiety came first: In 1991 while a year nine student I began to get panic attacks.  These were horrific and I kept them secret.  I was too ashamed to mention them to parents.  As my psychiatrist and I look back on that period, we are sure I was suffering depression also - but a bit later than anxiety, and perhaps in response to it.
I've tried everything for my condition: I'm currently taking high doses of two anti-depressants and two anti-pyschotics (although I have never had psychosis) and a mood stabiliser.
I filled out the little form on the beyond blue website to assess my mental state - K10?.  It was 34, and the instructions on the screen seemed to suggest that I should immediately rush myself to hospital.  But today is just a normal day like any other for the past decade or so
I don't work; subsisting instead on a DSP. I live at home with my parents. STILL.  I am absolutely starved of companionship.
Has anyone had ECT?  That is my next plan, albeit that I have some misgivings.
 
Any advice about how to pull oneself back from the brink would be welcome. (Actually though, just getting this down on paper has helped a little.)

I knew I was going to have a bad day today. It was how I woke up. I dont have a ""cant get out of bed depression"" rather and troubled tormented sad type with dysthymia. Often its poetry writing time.
My wife went to have lunch with her mother. So I was left to sort myself out. My wife has previously given me a task of digging up a patch of ground at the rear yard to improve our vegie garden area. So into it I went. Half way done and I was exhausted physically but mentally felt better.
Then when it was fully dug up I was done. Arms were cramping. Got a cold drink and sat there admiring my work. I then realised my depression was gone. My wife arrived home none the wiser. I felt I also achieved in that I didnt do the ritual- talk to her about it. This was indeed a day of achievement.
Do you have this ""remedy"" I know physically excercise can assist those with ADHD but I didnt think it help as much for depression...

I'm a first time user/poster to BB. I've been recently diagnosed with MTHFR genetic abnormality which has explained a whole lot of my past/present emotional tendencies and the issues within my family (alcoholic parents). In the world of MTHFR it means I under methylate which can cause anxiety, depression etc. etc. I had my first bout of depression and anxiety after I ended a long term relationship in my early 20's, lost family and friends over that and it was very hard few years...but came out of that depression with some lingering anxiety and minor social phobia issues. I am an overachiever and so always striving for better so with this I have held very demanding professional positions and always pushing myself to get over my anxieties etc.
Since my MTHFR diagnosis earlier this year (found after I did not recover well from the stress of 3 surgeries in the past 2 years) it has been so hard and overwhelming with all of the trying to find the right practitioner who actually knows about molecular biochemical pathways and nutrigenomics, doing the research to understand it etc as it's a relatively new field. I am on multiple nutritional supplements and feel a bit overwhelmed with this as it's taking months to fine tune it and I just feel like it makes me concentrate on illness rather than wellness! Last few weeks have been really hard and I am starting to feel that real disconnect I felt when I was depressed...I don't feel like anyone really knows me (or cares). I have many friends and acquaintances but no-one I can really talk to about the ""emotional"" me and I don't feel like my Husband or Son even know me, I just can't talk to them in depth about how I feel. I try to be the strong one who holds it all together for everyone. I'm now looking at other people and berating myself with ""why can't I be like that,  why can't I just get over these issues , why am I constrained by my anxieties..."". 
Why do I feel so disconnected from everyone and how do I get back on track?

I have suffered from anxiety and depression since I had my second child 15 years ago. Since then, I have been on different medications  to help with chronic insomnia, but other than bad days every now and then, I have been coping pretty well. I've had some kind of melt down this past week and have barely been able to function. Mornings are the worst, panic, nausea, foggy head etc. I have been off work all week but need to get back to work this week. Feeling very anxious about how I am going to function while I feel so bad?

Hey everyone, I am an early 30's male who has had Anxiety, OCD and Depression for 14 years. I thought i'd post on here, because its amazing how you feel so alone, but yet there are so many who are in similar circumstances to myself. I remember finishing VCE and very soon after that the house of cards came falling down ever so slowly. I remember this horrible, awful feeling of anxiety coming over me and it just never went away. Still hasnt today.I never told anyone about this. Not for 9 months. I just thought it was normal, but I knew I couldnt go on anymore. I tried a psychiatrist who put me on medication, but I was too erractic to bother taking it or see him, so my condition stayed like this for 3 more years. I just faked being happy and tried my best to please everyone, because pleasing myself was not an option as I didnt know what made me happy or where all this inner demons came from. I then found alcohol and drugs!! For the next 5 years I drank to oblivion, took drugs, partied for days on end because I hated reality so much back then. My family and friends were worried sick but I behaved for a few weeks to ge then the cycle started again. The penny dropped after writing off two cars and narrowly avoiding jail time that I should get help. Haha, well not so funny but I did have some fun going out over the years. yeah, great times!! Since 2010, I have been seeing a doctor and am taking medication, kicked drugs, drinking and smoking and have made small inroads on my mental state. I still get horrid panic attacks, uncertainty and the OCD is over-whelming, but over the last 5 years I feel im somewhat better if that makes sense. Things were going well up until February this year. I'd held down a job for 5 years, but I quit earlier this year because I thought I was ready for a change. Bad move!! I miss that place so much and I can't go back. I had great hours, good friends and although the pay wasnt so good, it was the job I always longed for! 5 years then one day your gone. Been unemployed since. 8 months. That's what anxiety and OCD will do. Runs you into the ground. Affects everything, including decision making. Think about suicide all the time, no good huh?On the outside, im actually a fit, good looking guy with a great personality. I actually love laughing!! When my body allows me too. I know alot of people would be shocked if they knew what i've been through/still go through.

I have only just recently become aware that I may have depression, still cant believe it.
I always thought I was just lazy or unfit. Been like this since a teen (40 yrs ago).  What has made me concerned is it's getting more frequent and starting to effect my work.   So.. here is an example - weekend.
I work all week 6 days, hanging out waiting for my 1 day off.   I have so many things I want to do or continue with, my Sunday comes and I will just sit in a spare room or on couch and spare for hours at a blank wall.    Usually I sort of come out of it at the end, to get some things done but day is pretty much trashed.  Doesn't happen always but having more.
I seem kind of paralyzed, not tired but not energized either, stuck in a mundane limbo.  Don't what to more or do anything.
Not even sure what triggers it, lately no specific reason or event.
There a pile of other stuff also.. (later).
I got a 36 on the K9 test also just before (was trying to be upbeat also but honest).
So, I guess I may be depressed, what level or type would I be?
Haven't seen /seeking any help yet, not sure I want to yet (more questions 1st), only did a on-line session earlier with an agent.  Was really helpful, for a moment I felt like I was actually worth something.
Could tell you more about my self but really don't want to bore anyone.
Thanks for reading  :)

new to this so bear with me ..  I guess it started 10 or so years ago with the loss of My best friend "" My dad "" keep in mind I was never a really outgoing Life of the party type to begin with . with my closes family 900miles away I relied on what was my core group of friends . for most of my life I keep 3-4 close friends  and never really felt the need to make new ones 
After depression/anxiety set in alone came more issues - Insomina , Tinnitus, Diabetes ect ect .. this made me fell even more alone and within 6 Month I was place on a Pension & a strick regime of Medications .. withing a Year my closes friend who have been showing signs of lossing intress in me as a friend "" can't really blame him I guess"" then another friend suffered a Stroke and yeat anoth cancer so all our lifes changed  no more Golfing , camping ect - I still take my friend that suffered a stroke to the movies a few times a Month where we have a good time . the last of my close 4 friend moved 800 Miles south  & I only see him 1-2 times a year now 
 Sorry If i am sounding like i am making excuses for bening lonley  I just am finding it so tough  to put myself out there ""do I even know how anymore ? I dont know ..  I have been looking at Meetup.com  groups  but that though of gathering with 20 strangers terrifies my to no end ..

 I guess a little info about me is needed , I am Male 51 on a Pension so I lots of free time :)  I consider myself to be a Kind person & very loyal someone who you can rely on .. while I am not the greatest conversationalist  I do my best , I like going to the Movies  and enjoy long walks ""to loss a few pounds"" I enjoy 4 Wheel driving in the bush , computer game that challenge me listing to Jpop even though I don't understand a word  :) I am looking at buying a Bike to ride around Parramatta Park

I am using this as a way to get my thoughts of my chest. Pls no judgment.  Not that I think anyone on here would.  I just feel so alone. I was diagnosed with depression three and a half weeks ago. I am 25 turning 26. I always thought in my own mind and this might sound so crazy but I always felt like there was something wrong with me. I would feel flat on weeks  and would b doing nice stuff with my boyfriend but still feel lousy and low. I masked a lot with alcohol. Not a big drinker but it was almost an escape from the constant burden on my mind. I asked my friend - a few close ones - and my partner and my parents quite often ""do you think I have depression"" and they would look at me like I was crazy like why would you have something wrong with you your life is fine. I always googled depression and always had headaches. To hear a dr and physiatrist say I had depression and anxiety was hard. I always believe in gut feelings and mine have always been right. I always used to have headaches but since I have been diagnosed I don't anymore as much. It's all been really hard for me as I have had had reactions to the medication I first got put on which have also cropped up on my second lot of meds. Very bad thoughts which are disturbing. And not me. 
I really just want this nightmare to be over but I feel like the whole thing had just been a journey for me almost. Not a good one but I have had to realise where I have gone wrong and how my way of thinking and my coping skills and my outlook on things - which is bleak and very negative due to past hurts - has almost compounded my depression till this point where I was at a breakdown and couldn't go to work. I feel like all those years I suppressed this nagging feeling there was something wrong with me it's all now come out and consumed me and I have to now deal with it. I'm seeing a phyc and she says I will have to change my way of thinking which will b hard work. As it's been this way for years. I get caught up on the smallest thing and blow it up and get sooooo down and upset about it. I know I am doing it but I just can't stop. I hope I can start seeing some better results with the meds soon as I really do want to get better. I hope whoever reads this finds some sort of comfort or feels not so alone because I know I do.

Hello- I probably wont sound any different to every other new person that comes on to Beyond Blue, but I will share my little bit as well... I am a young mother & wife. Yesterday, I was diagnosed with high to extreme depression & high stress levels. Ive known for years about my depression (well before my children) but I thought it would go away. I am an adolescent victim of sexual & physical abuse. I ""fixed"" it by suppressing as many bad memories as I possibly could. But, in each year that I get older, I find myself more withdrawn, negative & generally unwell. Ive had my fair share of mental breakdowns in the last few months; unexplained crying, paranoia, angry outbursts, unable to sleep-yet extremely tired, irritable etc But a few recent turn of events pushed me to finally see a GP yesterday & finally get the help that I know I need!! On the 8th of this month, a family member of mine comitted suicide. While we didnt have a relationship as such, his choice stuck in my mind. It really got me thinking... not that I wanted to harm myself but about all those times when ive just wanted to be ""gone"". I sat with my husband & I asked him in all seriousness 'Is there something wrong with me?' He couldnt answer me with a straight yes or no, instead, he could only give me examples of my behaviour & our conversations (aka my rants) & left me to make up my own mind. I cried & cried listening to just how much & how often I made him & our children feel worthless. I began recalling situations with them all where I knew I upset them & I couldnt explain why I did? Or how my words were someone elses fault. Full of self hatred & confusion, I did what so many of us do & I started googling. I was led to many different questionaires to check for different mental health issues. EVERYTHING kept telling me I have bipolar. This seriously scares the hell out of me as there is history of manic depression on one side of the family & schizophrenia & bipolar on the other. Monday, I woke up & lived out my day in denial like I did for sooo many years-nope-nothing is wrong, im ""normal"" im just doing my usual, over thinking things... then I woke up in tears yesterday uncontrollably. My husband & babies standing there speechless-  watching me sob - with No explanation- I knew I had to do something about this Now! It was really hard to confront this illness after concealing it for years, but I am determined to conquer it & get better to be the very Best wife & Mum I can be!!beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi guys
I don't want to be on medication but if my depression is endogenous. then there seems to be no other way. I read that therapy doesn't help with endogenous depression. How do I figure out exactly what's wrong with me? I have depression, a lot of anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive thoughts. I'm so scared of all of these things that are happening to me and have little to no trust in doctors and their pills. I don't want to be sick with this illness forever.

Hmmm the black dog is back again grrr finding it so hard just can't get out of bed and want to sleep all day.  Only thing that makes me happy is junk food, gorgeous children and reality TV.  So over feeling this way sleeping all day just seems a good way to not worry anymore. Anyone else do this ? Any tips to get over this depressed state and start living.

Hi everyone,   I’m new to sharing here but really needed to reach out for help.   I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for many years now and am currently in a massive low period. I recently left a horrible workplace for a better job- this is a good thing and I am proud of myself for moving on. However I now work for a very small business and don’t have anyone to really talk to on a day-to-day level and this had effected me more than I thought it would. I feel as though I have lost most of the friends I had despite trying to keep in contact and everyone else seems to be overseas, away with work or just too busy.    A couple of weeks ago I had a big meltdown whileI was home alone.  For the first time in years those truly dark thoughts came back where I couldn’t control my pain and emptiness and thought seriously about taking my life.  The worst part was having no one to reach out to. I felt totally alone and worthless. Although those really bad suicidalfeelings are not as strong I wake up every day with horrible anxiety and sadness. I often don’t know how I’ll get through the day at work and cry whenever I’m alone.       Since then my partner has come home from his business trip and has been really supportive even though I’m just sad all the time. I just wish it was over but I feel like it is just getting worse every day.  I can’t afford to see a psychiatrist and in my local area there isn’t like a community-based service that is cheaper. I suppose I feel lost, alone and desperate.      Anyway, I thought I should try to reach out here and see what happens. Thank you for listening and for your support   Laurabeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

hey guys. Well ive been sick for a while and the doc has told me I have a bacterial infection in my throat and its been killing me. Anyways today my emotions got the better of me and I just started crying for no reason and couldn't control it. It was horrible and I was out in public which was worse. Its like this feeling came over me and it was all too much for me to handle. Prob is I never know when its gonna come on on and start or stop I just cry for no reason I just cant handle being sick anymore and its showing through my emotions. I just cant handle feeling neuseas especially that brings on a crying session. I just candle it anymore :'(

Hello everyone, well I haven't been on here for a little while but I had to stop in today after hearing about Robin Williams. I'm very shocked and saddened by it.  Someone that for me had always been a symbol of happiness and heartfelt emotion, but he was struggling himself.  If only if only if only he had been able to reach out.  I know from my own experience that pain can cloud your judgment but there is always a way forward, always, even if you can't see it, please please reach out to the people around you and let them shine a light for you.  Love and hope to anyone who may be feeling like this right now.

Hi 
I'm new here. After being what I feel was bullied on Facebook I have decided to delete my account. It has taken its tool on my family as I cannot stop thinking about what this person has been doing. Becouse this is a family member of my partner,  I'm very torn. I tried to address the situation online by making a status not saying the persons name to bring it out in the open however that may have backfired on me. People say its just Facebook but why do they use it this way?
 My depression seems to cause me to obsess over things. Does anybody know strategies to not be so obsessive over people who don't like me? And how I can not react straight away, which gets me into trouble the most. 
I keep telling myself I'll get thru it but I feel like I'm just sinking into a bigger hole. :(

I am very lonely and suffer social phobia  - no friends that I can talk to.I have suffered depression most of my life due to my upbringing and anxiety has got worse and worse over the past few years. I feel like a huge failure. I have just turned 50 and am living on newstart and trying to raise my 2 children on my own. I have nothing - i live day to day and have no savings, my mother owns the house and I pay her rent. She is 77 and struggles to pay the mortgage on the house she bought 9 years ago so that the children and i would have somewhere stable to live. I am in my last year of uni studying law. This last year has been a particular struggle - I just don't feel i can go on with uni anymore at this point. I just need a rest or a holiday something I have not had for a long time as a single parent.
What i really want is for someone to take care of me - silly - I am not cut out for this world. If i could i would live on my own in a hut in the bush with lots of animals around - animals are safe. I look at other people who have friends and partners and jobs and I feel such a failure as it all seems so hard for me and so normal for everyone else. 
 
My poor babies had to witness their mother crying and hopeless the other day. What a sense of security that gave them!
 
Is there a world were people like me can live quietly without societies expectations and the pressures of a place that I do not want to be part of? I would like to sit in the sun and not feel guilty or that I am a failure  - at 50 with nothing.

Hi i am new to this forum. My story is too long to go into right now but i have been on antidepressants for 12 years and recently came off them over a6 month period in a possibly misguided attempt to support my teenage daughter who was also coming off hers. Suffice to say neither of us are doing well atm. I tried a natural antidepressant this past week but i seem to feel more anxious and have been having heart palpitations, so decided to stop this and thinking of going back on my regular medication. My daughter has been away at a youth rehab for 6 mnths and returned home about 6 weeks ago. They took her off meds while she was away as it is a very tough love program, but unfortunately seeing her so down and developing an eating disorder is bringing me down. Her father and i are divorced and although she sees him for 1 night a week, it is pretty much me dealing with it all alone and at the moment im not coping. Feel disappointed about going back on meds but i guess i need to do whatever it takes to be strong so i can help her also. Just needed to reach out to others who might understand as i dont like to talk about it much with others in my life who dont really know how im feeling. I have a pretty full on job and not feeling like im coping well with that either atm.I am going on a week long holiday with my daughter and son in a weeks time and hoping we are feeling ok to enjoy it. Any tips appreciated.

Not a good day Have cried for most of it. I've hidden from others so no one see's me cry and just moped about the farm. I feel very broken watching my ex wife take her and the kids stuff out of the house its gutting me to watch taking away fond memories and good times on the farm. Have been catching up with a few people of late for Christmas and just to say goodbye before i move away for work and just in case things turn bad and i don't get the chance to talk to them again sounds pathetic i know but just don't have the strength or fight to battle too  much at the moment. i know it sounds like I've given up just having a bad week i suppose, But i am really starting to scare myself and make myself believe it will be the last time i see many of these people. I have seen my doc again and went to the salvos to talk to someone but im just in a spot of feeling no matter what i do its not going change my situation and im still going to be alone and have nothing. All I can say is I'm very down and feel very broken and unfix-able today.

I currently help out by taking our neighbours child to school in the mornings along with my child. In recent times I have also been asked to take this child extra early. Some days have been ok and other days have not helped me out mentally. If I am struggling a few days in a row, the responsibility with an extra child puts me out.
I feel the requests for looking after this child in the early morning before school is becoming more frequent too.
How do I decline helping out without having to explain myself. I already take my child to school, so I feel the only way I can explain is to tell them about my struggles with my mind. I do not want to do this because this will leave me feeling vulnerable and looked upon as weak. I do not want to be treated differently and fell I will if people know. I am not ready for everyone to know. Only my husband knows and is always there for me and that's enough for now.

Hi, I'm new to BB but not really new to depression. I've suffered for around 6 years but it has gotten worse with time and now anxiety is a problem too. i do a lot of pretending. Pretending I'm doing better than I am, pretending I care about things I don't, and pretending I want to fix it......when the reality is I want it to be fixed, but couldn't be stuffed doing the work to fix it...you know?im a mum, a wife, a teacher, a daughter, a strong woman etc etc........that's the roles others have put on me.....I just want to be left alone and not have to deal with anything. I'm tired but I can only sleep cause I take large amounts of medications. I'm on strong anti depressants but they really aren't working well,I have issues that I apparently should be talking to a psychologist about but it just doesn't feel right to sit down with someone and chat about my past that can't be changed, and I have everything I'm supposed to want in life yet I'm still depressed and have anxiety.........what's the deal with that?  i can't be the only person who hates the idea of seeing a psych. Can I?

Im  single parent aand i dont know how im going to deal with looking after my daughter its that bad. as soon as my appointment was over today i came home and didnt get out of bed until i had to pick up my daughter. I need help but my sister cant as she has a friend staying over she hasnt seen in a long time and my dad is recovering from an illness as well and hes 70. No1 else is close by and they are too sick mentally to help anyways like my mum has bipolar and so does my step dad and they are on the yorke penin anyways. DOnt know what to do and feel soo crap im trying hard not to cry :'(

Hi,everyone,
Ok I'm new to all this but I also have an enquiring mind so that being said, what do others do to divert their brain from going sooo far down that its hard to climb back up?. I'm on quite a downer & nothing is helping. I cane to see if any others spend time talking to ppl like myself to help maybe with techniques on brain diversion from bad thoughts. I'm finding myself feeling alone & with no or  little support, so if anyone wants to suggest what they have tried well that would be appreciated. Thanks for listening

Hi I'm new to the Beyond Blue forum and hoping if I express myself on here with others, it may help.
I have realised over the last few years my depression is getting longer and stronger. I live on this depression rollercoaster. I am happily married with one child and both are very supportive. I have a regular job and seem to hold this together but outside of this I turn into a mess of low moods, hide from people and feel very lonely. I feel like I am two different people. I put on a front for work and then become me when I get home.
I usually manage my depression with exercise but everything I do is alone. Mostly because I want to be alone. Loneliness then leads to thinking then leads to depressing moods. up and down, up and down. 
Is it normal to ride this ride?

I don't know what is going on at the moment ...... i am so overwhelmed; i am struggling to think; struggling to stay focussed.  Too much to think of; I can't do it all.  I thought I was doing okay but now it has hit me and I don't know how to cope.
I feel like I am being strangled by so many things to do; so many things i have to worry about. I can't do this anymore.
I need to take a breath.

I actually don't know if I'm depressed or if this is just a really long case of feeling down.  For the past 2-3 months, I've had erratic mood swings. I sleep a lot and yet I still feel tired after. It's actually more of feeling fatigued than just plain tired.  I get cheered up easily, but then once that ""high"" is gone I'm back to feeling just ""blah"" about things. I've been more irritable and less patient lately as well.  Sometimes, I get really frustrated and I just want to scream.  Well, I do scream.  Inside.  I sometimes think of turning back to self harming to cope.  Lately, my boyfriend and I had an argument and it ended up him hurting me physically. Again.  I love him, but I don't think I deserve to be hurt like that.  He says he doesn't mean it and he just loses control and that I pushed him into doing it.  I do believe he doesn't mean to do it, but I don't know.  I've just been disinterested in a lot of things lately.  All I've been wanting to do is stay at home and in bed.  But when I' m at home alone, I find myself restless.  Sorry for the very confusing and disorganized rambling.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Not a great day for me today or a good week at all really. Been feeling really down for no good reason. I suffer from BPD and Dysthymia and find even little things get to me. Like watching the news updates where it says children or babies have been kidnapped or killed or missing makes me want to cry i can handle it when it comes to the young. Im such a softy. I cant watch movies if i know kids r gonna get hurt in some way. Unfortunetely a lot of movies dont tell u this until u watch it then i keep telling myself its just a movie and its not real over and over but it often doesnt stop the tears. Im soo emotionally fragile its not funny. Well thats it for now just feeling kind of neaseus and ot some anxiety as well. Prob will try and settle for sleep soon, we shall see. Bye for now x

Sometimes I find myself really wishing that I could fly out of my own mind and be in the mind of someone who hasn't experienced the things I have, someone who doesn't have depression, someone who is free from what feels like constant voices/thoughts telling me I'm not worthy because that mind is a place I would love to be...
I can usually keep the voices/thoughts at a low to dull murmur and sometimes forget they are even there, usually when I am around my partner, best friend or family...but at the moment I find myself wanting to hide away from everyone in my life because I feel like I have bothered them enough with my depression...I know they will support me and be kind to me, but I just want to push them away because I am sick of hurting them because of the way I feel about myself...this is the start of what I know will be a dark time for me, all the signs are there, I know them well...yet I still can't find a way to stop them from taking over and making my world grey again...
I'm hoping that by posting my thoughts here, maybe someone will have some advice on how to stop the darkness from winning again so I don't have to keep hurting the people in my life by shutting them out...because I want to protect them, from me.

Hello, I  wish to share my story as I think, hope and pray getting the feelings out of my mind to people who cannot judge me in person nor see my state, will help me.

I will start by saying I have sought help through my GP and thus a psychologist. It took a long time, people telling me I needed to see a doctor for me to seek help. I never wanted not to be ok. I told myself I was ok. I was not.
 My mother had brain cancer almost six years ago. I feel I never grieved as I had to be strong for my father. Recently he passed away too. The first few weeks whilst things were busy arranging things I felt I was fine, I was however running on autopilot. Once all the phone calls, visits came to a stop I had a hole that was left unfilled. I was in the family home, with the memories and reminders and my support system, a neighbor who has known me all my life went away.

I felt I had no-one as I had isolated myself from friends when mum died to concentrate on dad. I still have a couple of good friends and I think their presence saved me from thinking or keeping thinking no-one cared.

I broke down due to pressures dealing with dad's estate that I am not going to go into. I could not stop crying in the solicitors office, and she told me I needed to go see my GP as it was clear I was not copping.

I sat in the car outside the GP's practice for 20 mins. Eventually I convinced myself I had no choice as the solicitor knew where to contact my family and knew which doctor I was heading to. I convinced myself that she would ""dob"" on me. That was the only way I could get myself to go in.

I did not make it to the desk before I broke down again. A grown man crying and not able to get any words out. It affecte me even now I am typing this. I was lucky, the recpetionist was the sister of a friend. She knew that dad had passed away recently and she got me in to see the doctor, who also treated dad. It took me a while to settle down.

I am getting help now, it is helping a little. I am going back to ask for anti depressants as I am still not coping enough to be a part of society.  It is or was hard to tell my family. They were not shocked.

I am only at the start of what will be a long journey. I cannot get through a day without crying and at times it only takes a little thing to set me off/

The one thing I want to say is anyone reading this who has not sought help, please do. It is hard, I know it is hard. But it is just something you have to do!

Thanks everyone for letting me rant.

My depression is hardly there. As it waved goodbye in May it left me spells of fear. I think it was Snoman who suggested it had gone into a new phase.
Just lately I am really dogged with anxiety. I know it's a problem because today my Mum is travelling up to visit. I feel so anxious. Yesterday I rang her and asked if she'd come another time as I don't feel well enough (I've never done that before). She wouldn't cancel and is going to stay at my son's nearby. I'm so nervy about it. 
Also I am worrying about nothing. So I think it is another phase. Someone said that in a way it's a step further forward. 
I'm going to ask my GP to be referred for mindfulness course.
My overwhelming problem is my fear of never getting another good spell even though I always do. I think most people learn to be optimistic regading this. By nature I'm very pessimistic. I take after my Dad. 
But back to my question; does depression mutate?

I spend my days in the car the only place l feel safe away from the world. Through the fog and emptiness l watch myself slide into the deepest depression, consumed by hopelessness.

Hi guys,I'm new here and not really sure what I'm expecting from it but here goes!I've had extreme periods of mania and (mostly) depression since I was a teenager but was only ever prescribed antidepressants on and off. I was never referred to a psychiatrist or psychologist. I'm now in my early 30s and moved to Australia from the UK just over 2 years ago. The healthcare here has been so much better - I was diagnosed as bipolar straight away and started medication and therapy, although my medication is proving to be pretty ineffective at the moment.Life's been pretty turbulent since I got to Australia, with the breakup of my 8 year relationship and the death of my beloved dog amongst lots of other things. I didn't have any friends/family apart from my partner over here when I arrived and am now living by myself. I have made some friends but without a solid foundation of shared history it's not so easy to ask for help. I work full time and my employers are supportive but I've run out of sick leave from taking days off when I just can't face the world. I've just cycled through a mania coupled with extreme anxiety/panic attacks and am now on the other side feeling really depressed and alone. I've been to hospital and have an emergency appointment with a new psychiatrist on Friday to review my meds but I'm finding it really hard to cope with just existing until then without knocking myself out with medication. Unfortunately they're not good for driving and I crashed my car last week (nobody was hurt thank god). I'm exhausted from trying to keep my head above water, I can't afford to take any time off work and I just can't see how life is ever going to be manageable with this disease. I know I'm a nightmare to be with when I get sick so I can't imagine finding anyone who would want to put up with me but I hate being alone.  I'd love to hear how you have managed to cope, what you've found to be effective and I guess mostly how you can learn to accept being alone and not rely on others to get you through the worst of it?beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I had a question for the ""your questions answered"" page, but apparrently you need to ask them through the forums, so I hope I've got the right forum. Sorry if I haven't.
This site addresses the question ""why commit suicide"" and basically says that the answer or answers to this question are largely unknown or only partially understood.
Could you please offer some insight into the opposite side of this issue? Could you please explain why people who oppose suicide choose to continue living rather then not live anymore?
For some people, this question is as mystifying as the question of why someone would commit suicide seems to be for you, and I'd imagine that groups that are so resolute that life should always be prolonged rather then ended, such as your own, would be able to shed some light on this issue.
I'm truly sorry if this question offends anybody. That is the last thing I'd ever want to do. But I believe it needs to be asked, and more importantly, answered.
Thank you.

Once upon a time, the source of my light left me and she broke my spirit. When my spirit broke, she ceased being the light and became darkness. Now my ex has manifested herself as the dark shadow my despair.Last week that evil dark shadow hath descended upon our house.  That malignant despair has infiltrated the family home and taken root. The happy home of my children communing together in harmony has been dispersed. When they get home from school, the immediately vanish into the safety of their rooms. Their doors closed, that shadow of despair kept at bay.Our home is now quiet, so deathly quiet.  There is no conversation to be heard.  No laughter.  No joy. I feel so down, beyond blue, it's now black. It's so very cold. For even hope has gone home. And I find myself so very alone. I would want someone to help me, if I though someone could. But I know, no one is coming, I know no one would. I am alone tonight, as I will be tomorrow. As that witch of despair tightens her grip upon me. I must break free from this woman. But she puts me down, she pulls me down, she keeps me down. I can't hold the grudge, it takes too much energy, I forgive her. I hate me.

Every day is different. Some days I am completely numb - I go about my day in a haze, doing what I need to, speaking when I'm spoken to, even laughing along with a joke, but mostly just floating along without knowing how I got here or what has been happening for the last 10 minutes. I automatically do what I'm meant to, and then go to sleep.
Other days life sucks. My chest feels like there is a balloon inside it, pressing against my ribs, trying to burst out. My arms and legs are restless like they are waiting for something to happen. I feel angry or sad or scared or all three at once, for no reason. I can't stand the sight of people but desperately want them to see me, be near me, but please don't touch me or I might scream or cry or break apart in to dust. I force myself to breath.
Then sometimes there are the days that don't stand out - everything is so light and easy that it isn't until the end of the day when I notice the absence of fear, pain, numbness. Those days don't come very often.
I saw a movie once where someone said that madness can often be a choice. You can choose to let yourself fall in to the abyss, or you can keep fighting it. I understand what that means now - it would be so so SO easy to just slip right down in to my mind, to cry and scream and throw things, to become hysterical and numb at the same time, to mutter and forget that the world carries on around you and you need to just keep up.
So I try to keep up. 
I've never seen a GP or counceller or psychologist. I've never been suicidal, though I do think about it sometimes. I don't want drugs and I don't think just talking about it to a stranger will make me better (yet here I am on the interwebs...)
This is just how my life is, and I don't know any different. 
But I do want to know if I am alone? I hope so, because it breaks my heart to think anyone else could feel this way.

i think everyone who has experienced returning chronic depression must know this feeling.When you know the darkness is coming but there's nothing you can do to stop it.the storm comes and your holding on trying not to be sucked up into the turbulent destructive hurricane that will eventually spit you out in the middle of no where with nothing, once again.i dont know why its coming and i dont know what to do. there is no point in working because i am (physically) sick more days than well. I try to catch up with friends and family but i struggle to enjoy their company and the paranoia sets in. not to mention the constant fatigue and irritation.I thought i was doing ok -much better than last time- but every time someone asks me how i am, i struggle to act as fine as i say i am.is there any way out, to stop the storm, or is this just something I continuously must fight each year until i get strong enough to stop letting it affect my health?Antidepressants only keeps me out of hospital.

Ok. Twelve years ago I had a depression that was so awful I am still traumatised by it. Over the years my depression has become much milder and  sometimes my good spells have lasted for many months. Usually I come out of a depression within a few months and maybe within almost half of that my mood is good. 
I went into a depression that was very mild 6 months ago. A few good days here and there. In April I could actually feel the depression lifting above me one day. My depression became milder still. And since then I've had a few good weeks on a couple of occasions. I've also had  two separate weeks of totally irrational fear,believing I was definitely going back to that terrible place of 12 years ago. No amount of normal reasoning could change my fears. Each time it went within a week. 
Here I am now after several very anxious days - I think they're going now. My mood is mildly depressed. But if it's mild why do I just feel like screaming? Why do I want the day to be over. I will have another good day, maybe a few weeks. I know that it's the duration of it that's getting me down. It's the feeling that life will always be like this. The struggling to find the motivation to mow the grass later. The wanting to cry cos I've walked dog pooh in the house. The longing to enjoy my husband's company but even though I love him I feel too fed up.
Compared to my first depression this is nothing. But I think that for someone who had never experienced depression it would be awful - they'd feel their life was over. And in so many ways my life has had to die bit by bit. Working, living on my own, being able to help out my kids on a practical level. I've adjusted to all this. I just can't adjust to feeling rubbish in my head for much of the time.
Lots of people here have chronic mental health problems. They are all lovely people. The long term users rarely mention feeling rubbish regularly or for weeks on end. Is that because you are enduring these difficulties but trying to get by? Or are you going through a good spell? Do you have months on end of struggling? My GP sees me regularly. He says this is how I am. I do all the right stuff to help myself. My meds are ok. I think I've to just carry on enjoying the good bits and hoping I get a few months off again.
On here I've been given lots of support. Still I'm coming out with the same moans. I'm sorry about that. I just find it so hard to put up with this even though it's mild.
Thanks, Helen

Hi there,
When I was 18 a girl I loved killed herself. She threatened to do it for many years previously and suddenly just after we left school it happened. I was depressed for the next 5 years until I finally asked for help and dragged myself out of it. Shortly after putting that behind me I met the love of my life, and here I am 5 years later married with a young daughter and I've been living in Taiwan for 3 years. It was hard at first but I learned the language and get along well with my wife's family. 
i recently returned from a trip to Sydney to see my family and I've noticed those familiar symptoms returning rather strong. I took the test on this website and scored a 31 which is apparently high. 
my wife is also battling something which she wouldnt find help for, she's told me twice in the last year she wanted to kill herself. But there seems to be some sort of cultural block that stops her looking for help. Since the last time 2 months ago she has promised me she will see a doctor but hasn't got around to it yet. This really terrifies me but I feel at least she has taken the first step of admitting she needs help. 
I only do 4 hours work a week tutoring English and look after my daughter during the week. It's really hard for me to get a job here with no university degree. All my other foreign friends are well off English teachers and I feel like less of a man having to rely so heavily on my wife. I feel so lost and despite living here for 3 years I still feel a little alienated in regards to my career path. I've spent time looking for work in the past but I found no interest. No one needs a storeman with really bad Chinese over here. I also feel I don't have what it takes to teach a class. 
In the past I've blocked out my family back at home because I feel I miss them too much if I keep in regular contact. Since my daughter is getting older I've been calling more often and as the eldest in the family sometimes I feel so guilty about not being there for them when they have their own troubles as well as missing them terribly. 
I am having trouble sleeping and I feel so worthless and low I just don't know what to do. 
please help.

I'm in a really dark place today . A friend of mine asked me how I felt the other day my reply was I feel like I'm in a strange dark room and I can't find the light switch or the door to get out . My husband said last night I hope you have a good day tomorrow my reply was I won't ever day is the same , he said nothing because there was nothing he could say so like usual no sex tonight for him. I wait for him to come home that's all I do and he always comes home after work I don't know why he stays with me I am a shocking wife. He tells me to put the TV on or the radio but if I do I still don't here it . I'm just so numb . I made a cake for him the other day and burnt my arm didn't feel it . I really had to push myself to make the cake took me so long as I kept forgetting what the recipe was and to keep checking it was such a easy thing to do but to me it was a nightmare. I just can't wait till 3pm every day so I can have a bottle of wine at least the wine helps. And I know to moor will be the same .

hello.
i am new at telling people about these kinds of things. i haven't got properly diagnosed and i don't exactly want to. i have gone through depression before and it's happened again, it's not easy to deal with alot of the time so i try to block it out so it doesn't interfere with my personal life. it's been going on for the last few months to a year and it's still difficult and i feel like it's getting worse, for lack of a better term, the thing is i actually have a hard time trusting new people when it comes to talking about things like this and i would like to know if anyone has any tips as to how i could feel better without really going to other people. 
thank you.

I went off my meds a few weeks ago. I have no family, my few friends live in another state and I don't feel ok. I' m scared that my marriage will fail and I'll be completely alone in the world. I keep thinking of self-harming, not because I want to die, but because I just don't want to have to live for a little while. I would want someone to find me straight away, and tell me I can just go live in a hospital for a little while and not be responsible for anything . I don't know how to be close to people and I feel dead.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I've been depressed for a long time, and the only thing that's held me together was drawing. I love drawing. I use to have piles of drawings. I can't explain why but I destroyed all of them. That left me broken hearted. I feel like I have nothing now.
Worse than that, I can't seem to draw anymore. Nothing I draw seems to come out well anymore. I hate being unproductive. I just don't know what to do. I was already depressed but now I feel twice as bad.
All advice is welcome.

I am hoping someone might be able to share their thoughts on this mental health condition, narcissistic injury.  I have been diagnosed with this condition, narcissistic injury 18 months ago.  I am sometimes overwhelmed by terribly violent thoughts but they are no were near as controlling as what they used to be.  Sometimes the thoughts are like an out of control missile which can  turn on me, suicide, self harm.  It causes me incredible mental distress and pain, the pain may last for short moments, hours and long days. I have been admitted to a psychiatric hospital on three occasions.   You feel so distressed sometimes because  it is off the charts. When in hospital I was told  it was not appropriate to share my thoughts with other patients as it may scare them.   The only persons i can tell is my psychotherapist, who I am very lucky to have  and some close friends.  - Any feedback this character (villian) receives is usually perceived as a personal attack in him self which sends him into an inner rage, this rage is often disproportional to the ‘offence’ and will manifest itself through extreme irrational thoughts. I call it rage but actually it is really a very deep sense of pain and hurt.  The villain is narcissist very pre-occupied with him self, he is at his best (worst) when something important needs to be done.  This  villain is not some random fictitious thing that has just appeared out of no where, he was conceived out of a need to serve a purpose, which was  up until now, helping me cope and survive     -  hope this make sense.The hospital that i have been going to is actually very relaxing, the staff are fantastic and there is a real feeling of community among the patients.  I would encourage anyone with a mental health issue to speak to their doctor about getting an admission.  But mine is a private clinic so I am not sure how this compares to some public psych hospitals.Never the less I am really interested in hearing from someone with this condition,  As a consequence I have developed anxiety and am on AD and I am in fear of when the next episode may happen.  Does any one out there have this condition.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I am new to this so lets see how it goes.
I have been diagnosed with Depression and GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) I have been changing meds for the last few months with the guidance of a Psychiatrist but recently I feel as though they just aren't working.
I am constantly feeling like my heart is going to jump out of my chest. I feel like I am going to be sick. I don't want to eat, I don't want to do anything! I own my own business with my husband and I don't even want to go to work. I just want to sit and watch TV. I have recently put on 13kg's with the latest change of meds. I am the BIGGEST i have ever been and not liking it. I am jumpy and everything my husband and daughter do I find something wrong with it. I am over feeling like this, I am over being like this. I am just over it altogether.
How do people cope with their ups and downs? I am struggling!

I've lived my whole life with mental illness and lack of joy.  Lately I've been feeling so bummed out and miserable I wish I were dead.  I am a long term heavy smoker and I keep waiting for the day I get lung cancer so I could let it kill me and escape from this miserable existence.  I'm 52 and I'm fed up.  I don't want to feel this way as I would like to have some feeling of purpose and few periods of happiness here and there.  I am under the care of a mental health proff. but I""m already taking medication. Maybe it's not working anymore. It seems like I'm feeling worse and I don't know if any other meds could help.  I havent wanted to talk to my practitioner because all she'll do is send me to a psych ward where I'll be locked up and unable to smoke or do anything.  I'm heavily addicted to smoking and don't intend to quit.  I feel awful as I've been feeling pretty lousy over the past year.  I'm open to advice and shared experiences.  beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

With the terrible news of Robin Williams losing his battle with depression really hit home today, even though I have never been suicidal it has crossed my mind. I was so saddened that he felt so helpless and couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel 

Then today at work a co-worker was bullying another co-worker and I just couldn't let it go. I had a word with my boss and said how upset  that I was with this situation and it was uncalled for and totally disrespectful. What if this person that was being  
bullied 
suffered depression it could have been so detrimental to her health.  I am proud of myself for speaking up as I probably wouldn't have wanted to rock the boat in the past. I am feeling sad about Robin Williams and I am so upset, angry and my heart aches for the person who was being 
bullied today. 

I just needed to share with you all as I don't really have anyone close that I can share these feelings with

Hi I’m new to this website and i need your advice... 
For the last month or so I have had little motivation to do anything and i think losing my job almost 2 months ago is a main contributor to this since i now barely leave the house. lately I’ve been in bed all day finding myself in tears for no reason or just crying of the smallest things.  I’m doing an online course and the past few weeks i open it and no matter how hard i try i just can’t get myself motivated to do it or i get distracted straight away. Im beginning to have massive fallouts with my family and pushing them away. But in saying this i go out with my friends at least 3 times a week at night and I’m happy i also eat and sleep normally. i did the checklist test on this website out of curiosity and i got 30 which I’m very surprised about because i was honestly just thinking I’m just having a few bad days…. i just don’t know what to think

I was diagnosed with depression in early 2012. During 2013 I was fine, I had some ups and downs but nothing too serious. Then 2014 came around, and I've slowly been slipping. A couple of my friends know about it, and when I told my now ex-boyfriend he simply didn't want to deal with it and left. I don't want to tell my family because I'm scared they'll treat me differently, but it's starting to affect my life in more ways then it ever has before. I struggle to find reasons to leave my house and I've barely been to uni. 
Now one of my close friends, who's been helping me cope, has recently told me they're suffering as well. I don't know how to be there and look after them if I can barely look after myself. I don't know how to be strong. 
Some days are better than others, I've been feeling ok the past few days. But I know it's just a matter of time before I fall back down the rabbit hole. 
Please help

Hi I'm currently going through another major depressive episode, haven't had one for years but a spiteful ex ( it was him that caused the previous episodes) and chronic pain have put me back in the hole again.
I consider myself a nice person, I am considerate and have compassion for others. To have someone who hates me so much that he wants to ruin my life takes my breath away. I can't conceive how anyone could treat anyone else in such a way, even if they were an enemy. Particularly when that person knows my medical issues and carries on regardless.
The ex and I have two children and we share 50-50 care. He is using the child support agency to extract money from me ($900 per month) even though I pay 2 to 1 for all the kids costs and I don't work (I'm a PhD student on a stipend ~$1800 a month). He says I left work to get out of paying him which is rubbish. I have medical and psychologist reports to back me up but the CSA just hear his side. They also took $5k out of my tax return and gave it to him because of a computer error, they apologized but won't give me my money back and he refused to return it. I have some hefty medical bills so I have had to apply to the federal court to try to get the money back and to stop them taking more money. I have to do it myself as I can't afford legal representation. I'm very lucky I have a supportive husband who has a law degree. I can't think what it would be like to battle the CSA & a nasty ex without resources.
Needless to say my research is really suffering. I feel pretty awful right now.

Hi, everyone. My first time here (just joined).
Anyway, is this depression, or does it sound like it might be?
I have very low self-esteem and always feel like others are ""better"" than me. There's no reason for me thinking that, and I know at heart that it's silly and that I have the respect of friends and colleagues, even senior management (I'm a school teacher), but there's still no getting around the feeling. It only takes one bad incident for me to think it's all too hard, and then I retreat into myself and internalise everything. I'm a great listener, but not a good talker. I drink too much alcohol, but I wouldn't say I'm an alcoholic. Having said that, I'm from a family of heavy drinkers/alcoholics (father, both grandfathers), so it could get worse. I often think there's no point to life, but I think of it in a more philosophical way - what's the point of anything, really, when we're all gonna be dead in 100 years? Does it really matter if you die at 40, 60 or 90? What impact can you possibly make in the world? That kind of thing. I've thought about suicide, but only to think that I'd never do it. I suppose I'm just imagining what it would be like, rather than actually considering it.
I love my daughter deeply and would never leave her for anything. My wife also thinks very highly of me, as do my mum and siblings. 
I think I'm a talented musician, but would never have the confidence to go and pursue it it a meaningful way. That's a significant part of my thinking in my mid-40s: the failure to live up to potential. Yeah, that's the hardest thing, and it gets worse as I get older.
It's hard to explain. A friend of mine with serious depression (twice a suicide attempt) said to me, ""Oh, you've got depression. You just deal with it better than me."" 
I did the 10-point quiz and came up ""moderate"" (score 22), which surprised me. I thought it would say,  ""Go away. You're fine.""
Just wondering what you all think. Grateful for any replies.
Thanks.

Hi guys. I'm new here but have been battling mental illness for over 10 years now. I'm having an especially hard time recently and don't think I can do it on my own so I thought maybe an online forum would be a good way to help get back on track, back to 'stable'. Discussing these demons with others who are or have gone through similar things... After I post this I'll look at some other peoples posts and try to help where I can.
 There's not nearly enough room to post a brief history and where I'm at currently :( I keep running out on characters. Hopefully after posting this it will let me edit or comment... So on to reading other peoples posts.

Hi I'm Alastair 26 yo. Father of 3
 
I'm here today as I've been suffering depression for a long time now. I've never bothered to do anything about it but I'm fed up feeling sad all the time. The last 12 months havent really been peachy I split up with the kids mother last year after a 7 year stint. We were always behind with money and money was always what input my sadness down to but now things are a lot better financially and I'm living with  2 good friends. I'm always feeling disappointed and I always see the negative in anything . when family or friends try and have a conversation with me I just want them to shut up and leave me alone. I will even go as far to hide from them so I don't have to have a conversation. 
 
I hate being like this and I'm ready for a change

You hear this all the time.... ""Just find someone to talk to"", ""People want to help""...
What a load of crap. It would be nice if it was true but in reality, the reason people like me do not talk to anyone is because most people really don't want to hear about your problems. I've actually had people get up and walk away from a table when I've been talking about my relationship issues. They don't want to hear your boring depressing problems as it ruins their day. Even my best friend is not interested in talking to me when I feel down. She is over it. They all seem to think that you should just get better and stop whinging. 
Where was Robin Williams wife when he was at his lowest? She went out shopping. Surely she knew he was at a very low point. Why didn't she stay by his side?
i wouldn't mind betting this post doesn't even get published because it is too negative and depressing.

i often feel that im not actually depressed and dont need help, that im just down and that i would be wasting everyone's time if i burden them with my crap. as i read in the depression descriptions i gather that im a melancholic depressed person. i have for years felt that nothing good will ever happen in my life and that im unworthy of anything good. i have this awful feeling of disconnectedness and dont find joy in anything. it feels totally horrible. to be doing things that are considered fun and not find any feeling for it, to be around people who are laughing and joking and not find any humor. to have this numb sad feeling cover everything thats good.
as a kid i had dreams of travel and happiness and laughter and good jobs, fame and family. life hasnt turned out as i thought or hoped it would...  i feel that it doesnt matter what steps i take to improve my lot that i never make it there. i feel that it doesnt matter how much i love a person or people that the feeling will never be reciprocated, that somehow everyone can tell that there is something unlovable something wrong something unworthy about and in me. ive been on medication before and the feeling of numbness, and the feelings of being unlovable didnt go away. i still found no joy in life. am i always going to feel like this????????

Hey everyone, I don't really know where to start. I guess it all happened when my Father passed away when I was 19 due to a heart attack. I'm almost 33 now and the pain of depression has really taken it's toll. I just feel as if I have no where else to turn.   I'm the type of person that tries to be liked by everyone, hiding behind my mask of bitter sadness. I find it difficult to maintain relations and constantly wind up pushing people away, even though I continue to try to be a nice, generous and caring person. I just feel as ifno one really cares.  My mind is constantly flooded with thoughts of paranoid illusions, depressed feelings and sometimes, on the really bad days, suicide. I don't think that I could ever go to that extreme, but the thoughts are there and it frightens me to no end. I'm lost. I've remained at home living with my Mum as she has depression as well, though not to the extent that I've gotten too. She's a loving caring person that wants to keep her family close, but her only brother tried to take his life last year. He has many bad problems himself, and so cannot dedicate himself to my Mum, which saddens her. I try to stay strong for her as I know she'll be destroyed to know the darkness that resides within me is pushing me to the end.   I just don' t know where to turn. The actual friends I have are all married, some have kids. I feel left behind and isolated. I work as a Baker so my shift hours constantly conflict with any social activities that my friends have on. Hope someone can help shine some light into this dark corridor I've found myself in. I'm really struggling to hold it together. Thanks.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

This is my first time sharing thoughts on this site but having read several of the posts it confirms the need to talk through the thoughts and feelings floating around in our heads. I, like so many, have been through various levels of depression/anxiety for many years now. I've been on medication, seen psychiatrists and psychologists to varying degrees of success. Of late the pressures of this year from both running a business and in my personal life have found me veering back to my old thought patterns. Intense pressures at work along with the lack of a stable relationship and just recently an old friend and I seem to have ceased being friends, all inncuous enough but when layered on top of each other can really cloud ones world view with a very negative pall. I do keep myself active with both gym/ yoga and surf (weather permitting) even the simplest of things like a long walk does break the chain of negative thoughts. So in the end of the day it comes down to vigilance and even in the darkest of moments believing that there is a purpose and reason for carrying on. John

Always large for my age in a mans world ex military, prison officer, security etc a world where crying immediately and permanently embeds weakness into other mens assessment of you. Behind the scenes the big man became himself- a weeping mess battling illnesses I never realised I had. That was from as long as I can remember until 2 years ago or so. Then...the crying stopped! I've wondered if that has been good or bad...and why it stopped.
Crying is thought to release stress hormones in the body. So there is a reason for it. It can be socially attractive to do in some cases. Attracting help for example. For me- I always ended up with a headache! if I cried.
So why did I stop crying?  Well I can paint a short picture of the circumstances. What was happening prior to 2 years ago? My medication had been correct after many years of false diagnosis and wrong medication from that false diagnosis. I'd dated and married my wife 3 years ago. So there are some changes, but it doesnt address something. Within those two years I'd had 2 meltdowns or ""episodes"" as my doctor called them whereby on both occasions wandered aimlessly where ever my body took me. Fully in a depressive state but I did not cry.
I recently felt depressed. My depression doesnt last long nowadays. But I walked into the bush and sat, for hours, numb. I was aware a film of water enveloped my eyes but no tears fell. That's odd I think. Then I walked home. I needed the connection to nature, I needed to be alone. I was not suicidal. Planned that 18 years ago and I'll never go there again nor put my loving family through what could have been. That avenue IMO is stupid and selfish. Both my brother and uncle went that way
I read on this forum upset people telling us they have cried all day. I feel for them, they must be hurting, they must be feeling empty and hopeless. They likely do not see any relief in their pain. 
Well there is relief, there are answers there- they are just in your line of sight, just beyond your reach and it is in the form of management. 1. Correct diagnosis 2. Correct medication 3. Correct quantity of medication. 4. Appropriate professional support 5. The will to get better 6. Environment 7. Supportive family and friends. 8. Less work pressure and so on.
Achieve some of these and the light at the end of the tunnel might get closer and brighter. And you just might cry less. And I still dont know if crying less or more is better for you....

Today I am suffering my worst bout of depression that I have ever experienced in my whole life and I don't know how to cope.
i have an appointment to go to in half an hour but I can't get out of bed. I rang and tried to reschedule but another appointment was not available. I'm afraid to go out because I feel like if someone even looks at me the wrong way I will break down and cry. 
I don't have any strategies to help me get through days like these. Normally I would just hide under the covers but the more I do that the more it will impact on my kids and my overall ability to deal with my depression.
How does everybody else deal with days like these? What do you do to get through? I'm so foggy from my depression I just can't even think of ways to help myself because quite frankly I don't want to help myself today.

I feel so sad and low, I cry every night . I cant control it anymore. I can only describe it as a empty blackness that is consuming me inside. I feel myself drifting further into the darkness and I dont know how to fix it anymore. Is normal to much to ask? Is not having to fake smile such a big request? It feels like happiness, pride, achievement and sanity are too far for me to grasp hold of. Im stuck with sadness, anger and worthlessness. I dont want to continue feeling like this. I try and seek help but its not enough. I am scared if myself. I am not who I used to be. I am losing the plot at home and work because of this. I cant continue like this. I miss the REAL me and so does my family. I can see that. I try to talk to people but I cant express how im feeling in person. Im at a loss and not sure whats next or left anymore.

Sorry.

Well I've been down for a while because of certain events, but the last two days I feel really anxious and depressed.  I changed my routine this morning which was great but I was still sad in the new routine, but it was a good change. I feel like I'll never move forward.  I don't think I'm meant to be happy in life.  I know happiness is a choice but my mind won't let me go there. Sometimes I think I have more control if I'm unhappy because I'm happy something will happen to ruin it.

I have struggled all my life with depression, some days are worse than others but always it's a struggle to smile. My mother was a paranoid schizophrenic who had under gone shock therapy 3 times by the time I was 8. Childhood was isolating and I was different. Traveling was how I escaped and left home when I was 16 to backpack before that word existed. I haven't been on medication since my children were small and I realized I had no mothering instincts or skills. Now there is just me and my husband, the kids have all grown up and I really don't see the point anymore. It's just too hard and I don't feel that instinct to survive or to justify my existence anymore.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I can't put it down to any one reason - I'm just feeling really bad about everything and thats' a shame 'cos I had been doing really well for the past few days. Bummer!!One bit of good news though - I FINALLY have a date for my first psych visit. I only have to wait another week, so I'm relieved about that. Boy, is she gonna earn her money with me!!!I hope my head stops doing the unhappy-dance soon... Ihate myself even more when I'm sad. Zoe x

Hi everyone.
I was diagnosed with anxiety in my teenage years (prompted by bullying) but over the past decade of so, I can recall lengthy patches of sadness and just general misery. I've never been on medication - I've always maintained that its just anxiety and sometimes I have bad days - but I've just reread a diary from my early 20s and I was definitely experiencing more bad days that good.
I'm now 30, have been in a relationship with a wonderful man for nearly 3 years and things are going well, but 12 months ago he told me he wanted to move to the country and I didn't deal with it very well. Just recently he has changed his mind, and said he wants to take up a new career path, which might involve us moving overseas.
My initial reaction to everything is negativity. He has told me before how negative I am, and I almost feel like its ingrained in me - the anxiety forces me to go to the worst possible scenarios first and I'm automatically opposed to new ideas. Once upon a time at school, I had wanted to live overseas doing exchange, but the anxiety got the better of me. Now I'm being given this opportunity, with a support person, and all I can do is focus on the cons.
I'm concerned that the way my mother is (quite negative, and i'm the eldest and only daughter) has had a significant impact on my attitude and I don't know how to fix it.I feel melancholy most of the time and I have trouble communicating how I feel. I've been seeing a physiologist for years under the GP mental health plan, and i've just signed up for 2 classes (one on self esteem and the other on assertive communication) but I'm terribly concerned I might also be suffering from depression.
My youngest brother has depression and has been affected for more than ten years, so its in our genes. I just don't think I know what to do - I'm risking my own happiness by bending to my mental health and while my partner maintains he loves me too much to leave, I'm risking his happiness by wanting to live in my bubble.
Basically I am more scared than I am excited. How do I deal with my negativity?
Thanks in advance.
Sarah

Lots of people on here are suffering but don't burden people with it.
I'm sorry but I seem to have to share my pain.
This depression is so mild but has dragged on. I'm coping most of the time. But periodically I'm experiencing something different and horrible. This is the third time in a couple of months. It's intense fear. The first two times my mind told me I was going back to the bottom. I was terrified but each time after a terrible week it went. After the second time I was left with a fear of the fear - sounds crazy but sometimes I think I am. And so yesterday after a few good days fear lurched into my body. That had happened on the two days before but had worn off after a couple of hours. This time it's stuck. This time I think that for the rest of my life I will have this horrible fear. A close friend assures me it will go away again, my husband does too. But I'm not able to believe it.This experience is awful. My GP knows I'm getting this and accepts it's horrible. Because my depression is so mild and my anxiety too I think he feels it will go. Certainly the saying 'familiarity breeds contempt' has something in it. Just now though the whole thing is scaring me. I'm carrying on as normal - I believe that's how I got out of it before. Fear blocks hope and I'm scared. I just keep crying. At the charity shop yesterday I had to fight tears. 
I do think depression comes in different disguises. Like any illness it's job is to thrive. What's peculiar is I've come out of worse depressions more easily.My friend tells me this is the course it's taking - it won't get the better of me because I'm not giving in. I don't know. I just want peace.
I wish I was brave. I'm the opposite to most people, I wear my heart on my sleeve. I can't hide my depression. My emotions feel too big to keep in. People on here understand the pain of depression even if our symptoms are different.
I have to say that my meds are fine - and my GP  sees this as unfortunate rather than a problem. I can see his point. People who know me say they've see me improving over the months and if wasn't for this fear I would agree with them. 
Thank you for reading - I honestly wish I could have a physical illness.

This is only the second step I have taken in seeking advise/help in the past 5 years. I'm the first to extend a hand, offer a shoulder or bend over backwards for my family. I can just never take my own advice or open up about the issues which are eating me alive. Everyday I read the news and hear of the horrible things people are going through, always makes me realise how superficial and insignificant my issues are and I push them aside and tell myself I should just be grateful for what I have. I put on such a front to my family, they must think everything is peachy in my life, but really it is lonely and dark.I am only 29 but think it would just be easier to call it quits and hope there is a next life so I can give it a better go, how pathetic is that! I have no drive to take charge and even if I did I would have no idea how to start. I think my issues all stemmed from financial issues that started about 7 years ago (wow, that's a long time - how have I not got myself sorted in that amount of time)?!I remember the first time I picked up the phone 7 years ago and flipped through the phone book to see a Psychologist, I booked an appointment, then found out how much it was going to cost so I called to cancel.  I haven't picked the phone up again since.I got myself into a situation all those years ago and instead of asking my family (who I know would have done anything for me) for help I dug myself deeper into financial trouble. I have left myself with a bad credit rating, can't even get a phone plan! Even typing this I'm telling myself how pathetic I am - sort yourself out and get on with it! I just don't know how. It seems like the path ahead is just too steep and I won't be able to push on. I feel like such a disappointment and I'm so embarrassed for getting myself in this situation. I know so many people have bigger more serious issues, but this is my issue in my life right now and the effect it has on me is huge.I would love to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation - I need to start putting one foot in front of the other to get myself sorted and start planning a futurebeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

This is a little daunting, posting in a public forum on a topic like this, been so open. Especially since I'm very private as a person and heavily introverted. I've been plagued by depression and anxiety since early teens (now early 30's), spent many years in a viscous depression-substance abuse-depression circle that I was lucky to come out of alive. I was finally diagnosed and medicated a few years ago and things have been getting better in some respects, although I still drank far too much and still had plenty of bad days.
I recently moved to QLD, seeking new adventure, hoping for amazing things to happen. I've managed to stay sober for about 7 weeks now, started new physical exercise hobbies, met an awesome girl who I got along with brilliantly, so much in common...till today. Apparently I'm too nice, too sensitive emotionally and too concerned with making sure people are happy. Which is probably correct, my anxiety freaks me out and I get sickeningly worried if I think someone I care about is unhappy with me or disapproves. So...it appears to have just cost me a relationship with someone amazing, while everyone around me is married, having kids and enjoying life, and my first response was to think I need a drink and I've fallen in a miserable heap. 
Not sure what I'm hoping to achieve here. Maybe I just need to vent. I read some other people's posts and my complaints just seem trivial. I've been dealing with this for so long its long past the stage where I feel bad for constantly hassling friends for support, especially when only a handful know I have issues. I may head to a GP for a mental health plan and referral to counselling again. I did this before I moved interstate, but spent a few years in disappointment as I occasionally worked up courage to see a psych, only to not click with them and not achieve anything. I finally found one I liked, then my GP refused to give me another mental health plan and talked about coming off my meds, which scared the hell out of me. 
Sorry, this is turning long winded. Dont know what I'm doing here. Have the desire again to pack all my commitments in and disappear somewhere...while at the same time been in fear of appearing a failure from the perspective of societal expectation, going against the grain of stereotypical stability. But at least it would be quiet, peaceful.

It was at a hospital and for the 2 days that I was there I kept bursting into tears.i really want to be able to work but now I'mcrying all the time and feel so worthless being supported by my wife. Some mornings I just lay in bed trying to think of a reason why I should get up.latey I have been thinking that everyone would be better off without me around.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I have a question or two, I hope that's ok. from as far back as I can remember, there has always been times when I have felt down and wanted to be alone. It was picked up by others including my primary school principal who tried to give me 'special' jobs (water his plants, stuff like that) and then calling mum. No idea what was discussed, never cared to ask. last year I attempted suicide, it was the first time doing that, I was so angry at the time. Ended up at the hospital, they sent someone in who 'assessed' my situation. I told her what she wanted to hear and was subsequently sent home. I told the hospital I did not want a report sent to my GP.I spoke with my GP and told him that I did have thoughts but would not act on them (again telling them what they want  to hear). All the while I'm being asked 'why do you feel this way?'. I done a session via video link with a psych and again was asked why I felt that way, what did I think the reason was. So again, I told them what I thought they wanted to hear. I think I have lived with this for so long now, I know how to hide it well or how to make others feel better by telling them what they expect.The truth is, I don't think there is a reason why I get so depressed or why I have all these horrible thoughts. Does there have to be? sometimes I can be happy and like a switch,I can get so angry and so sarcastic towards my husband. At the time I don't care, there is almost disdain there. Afterwards I feel terrible, absolutely rotten. this is hard to explain but sometimes, things get so 'loud' and 'rushed' in my head, imagine a hurricane. Not voices, nothing like that. I don't know how to explain it. It only happens when I try to sleep.also, is it normal to feel physically sick? My stomach is in total knots,cam I just imagining this?sorry for all the questions, this is the first time I have been honest or open about any of this. beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hope you're all really well.My name's Aaron and around four weeks ago, I got officially diagnosed as having depression. It wasn't a surprise, though, and just confirmed what my wife had been noticing for a couple of years. I started becoming very introverted, withdrawing from the daily life of friends and family. More to the point, I stopped interacting with our daughter, always finding an excuse to do nothing or be distracted by things on my phone instead of hanging out with them.I imagine like most people, it just got to a stage where I couldn't function any more. My head always felt so swollen, almost like a really bad head cold minus the sniffles.I haven't really divulged it to a lot of people. To the people that do know, however, I've received a lot of support and understanding of where I am. Work has an unlimited EAP resource for us and I'm making progress with meds. Unfortunately, the suicidal thoughts just won't go away. I'm running/exercising/doing whatever it takes to ease my mind but it's taking time. I'm being as proactive as possible to try and stay positive throughout these initial days and I'm hoping that there'll be a stage where I feel 'normal'...whatever that means.I'm looking forward to being a part of the community here to talk openly about where I am and to hear of others' experiences.Thanks for your time :)beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Why is it if I CAN get myself out of bed in the morning and go to work (without calling in sick, that I can manage to JUST get through the day at work (and do a very good job), then the last hour of work get super anxious and do the drive home wanting to stop into a bottle shop and drink on the way home (which I would never do) and get home and be so anxious.I'm on medicatiom, I've done the therapy, I no longer have the nasty partner, I now have a nice job, but I just keep wanting to drink but it no longer settles the nerves. When I do it takes me 3 days to get over it including the process of suicideI just want to go somewhere where I can be cared for and helped but I can't go during the week because I can't leave my boss but I could go on the weekends. Does anyone know where there is someplace I can go on the weekends and get some help. The thing is I go through stages and feel like I'm crazy then I feel an overwhelming feeling like I need to be normal and feel guilty for letting people down. All the mean while I'm not sure I can keep on living like this. I'm not sure I can trust myself anymore. I need some help and advise please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I have been pretty good, until a few days ago.  I have been fighting the beast almost constantly and getting tired of it.  I want to curl into a little ball under the doona.  I know I can't give in to it, or I will slip back into the hole.
I am a nerdy type, so I have been researching into the effects of depression on the brain.  If you don't want to read too much sciency stuff, skip the next three paragraphs.
I learned a few months ago about the impact on the hippocampus which is believed to play a role in memory and concentration.  I noticed that in me, my memory got severely impacted, as did my ability to concentrate.  I started to do mental exercises to improve memory and concentration.  I think this helped.
Recently I learned of some research that suggests that AD's don't help by elevating low chemicals like serotonin, but they help by starting to repair the hippocampus.  This is good news.  Research into repairing the damaged brain function is welcome.
I also learned that when we ""ruminate"" on our low moods, we make it harder for the hippocampus to repair itself.
This knowledge is making me determined to:

Continue exercising my brain to help it repair
Avoid ""wallowing"" at all costs.

The problem I have at the moment is that last one.  I have so much to do (not really, but beyond what I feel capable of right now).   I am currently trying to apply for jobs, go house hunting, work on a project I have been contracted to do and be the stay at home dad.  This with significant financial pressures.  I am finding it so hard to get done what I need to, and I think I am wearing my happy mask again for my wife's sake (and mine).
Just needed to vent.
Thanks.

After making public my battle with depression via my Facebook account, I seemed to connect with many other people who are struggling with varying versions of mental illness, all of whom I had no idea were doing so privately. That effort to write down all of my darkest and deepest thoughts from the past 6 years was in one turn liberating, but also terrifying and very nearly caused insomnia for a few nights. Family have encouraged me to join up to the forums on here and share my thoughts and story, so that I can further investigate this illness, and how it is affecting other people (especially those about my age, 24)I have been married for just over a year now, and my wife and I are very much struggling to maintain a healthy and working marriage, very much due to my illness and it's effects on my personality and actions. Depression is not an excuse though, I do take full responsibility for everything I so and do, and more importantly when I feel down, all the things I do not do or say. My method of coping when depression sets in, is to retreat inside myself and clam up, not talking, not getting out of bed and ruining any headway I had made against anxiety and depression. Not knowing what to say or exactly how I feel is the main cause of this method, however it frustrates my wife immensely and debilitates anyone from being able to properly help me, because no one knows what's going on inside my head.So instead I contemplate methods of removing myself from thetorture of constant feelings of failure, disappointment toward those I care about, and seeing my wife break down in tears, and know it's all my fault. I have made several attempts at taking my own life and came close to succeeding and recently have had to stay with my parents so that I have very little time on my own, making it a lot more difficult to get in that state of mind again. I have a whole story behind all of this, but this is where I am at right now, and help is still a long way off. No one on the outside will every fully understand, and knowing that, to me, is proper torture.~GutterStars beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I was wondering if I had depression, I didn't think I had because I thought people with depression stayed in bed all day and couldn't function, but I go to work etc and don't feel bad every single day. I suppose I have had weeks of feeling down for the past few years I just thought maybe I had extreme moods only when I am in these moods I feel like nothing in life is positive, theres nothing to look forward to, I feel like ive been hit with a ton of bricks and nothing can cheer me up. I wondered if anyone else feels like this? Anyway I made an appointment for this afternoon with the dr and an appointment with a psychologist next week, as this week I feel terrible I snapped at my son this morning for something small, then I got upset that I over reacted and then I went to work and felt like I couldn't breathe or calm down for over an hour, and then someone said something to me and I burst into tears, I'm so negative and I haven't always been like this, I cant put a finger on what exactly is bothering me. Any advice would be great

I am suffering from depression - in that I feel constantly sad, gained weight and just performing daily dutied takes enormous energy. Due to a lot of fairly recent issues occurring, I feel that a lot of my undealt with chidhood issues have raised their painful heads AGAIN.
In the past, I have had years of councilling, which in the short term does reduce the pain by sharing it with a concerned person - however, with, I feel,  no real long term effect. I really would like to get past this pain ( of not feeling loved and supported in my life) - but I really don't know how to do that.
I have heard that the pain won't kill you - but the addiction will. However, I find the pain extremely debilitating. So - do I just plaster a smile on my face and get on with living (while squashing all of these feelings back down ) or do I really try to deal with the pain??
I have read that just sitting with the pain and getting in touch with it and going into it  leads to happiness. I have not been able to achieve this , to date. Has anyone got any suggestions or ideas??
P.S. In the past, I have had medication and went as high as a kite,
Warm Regards,
Susann.

Hello, any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.
I've experienced depression on and off since I was a teenager, so this has been over 20 years now.  Normally I am depressed, seek treatment, am fine for a while then I sink back down into depression again.  It constantly cycles. My most recent experience of depression is really starting to scare me.  I'm in a job that I hate (and have been in for a long time now, and the feelings have been getting progressively worse).  I am paralysed though and don't know how to make a change.
Increasingly, my depression is taking the form of anger and complete blind rage, my partner is the one suffering the brunt of this and I'm really scared to lose a really good person from my life.  I don't know how to change my situation and really have no idea what else to do. The pressures at work have been getting worse and worse and I don't know how much longer I can keep turning up there.
Every little thing has been getting to me and making me so angry.  I'm seeing a professional but it is really not helping me at all.  Lately, my frustration over life has been getting so bad that I fall into an uncontrollable rage and I yell, swear and throw objects across the room.  I'm at a total loss.  I don't want to be dead, but I'm putting on a big fake, front in my workplace and I don't really feel like life is worth living either.  I don't want to be so frustrated, exhausted, upset and angry all of the time!  Any advice appreciated!

Hello friends,
after having a somewhat horrible couple of weeks, yesterday I took myself to the doctor, had a quick chat, did a questionnaire and was told I have depression.  I have been feeling really low for a while, I'm a Project Manager for a government agency and have just recently taken on the role after a restructure, my partner and I have been having issues with our relationship for a while, we recently lost a 2 year court case in the federal court and I'm a father of two beautiful children under 3.  I feel as if the struggles and constant grinding of my day to day life have caught up with me.  I have seen a counselor who gave me a lot of printed material on anxiety and depression.
I'm now 34 and find myself living in what seems like a black hole.  2 months ago my life seemed 'normal' but I think that things had been building up.  I went to work earlier in the week and found myself sitting in front of my computer but not being present, I took myself home as I was struggling to be there.  I'm now here putting an entry on the beyond blue website to share my story and read yours.
I think I have some underling issues causing my depression, I can be a caring, sensitive person and usually put others first, I also tend to worry about what other people think.  I have had anxiety in the past, I had a motorbike accident in Thailand when I was younger and suffered Anxiety when I returned home.  I did however managed to get on with my life, progressed in my career, met my partner etc and have had a lot of fun.
I'm now in a place I'm not familiar with, I will get better just at the moment I'm struggling to find or see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I currently do have trouble sleeping and worry a lot during the night, some times I think I'm going crazy and that I'm a horrible father.  My mind seems to spiral in thoughts sometimes.
I realize now what depression is like and that its a big issue.  I'm trying to find comfort in people who have overcome it and how.  Sometimes the stories I read make me feel worse but there is also comfort in knowing others every day all over the world are going through the same thing.  To all of you i send you a big HUG.
My partner unfortunately doesn't understand mental health issues and thinks I should snap out of it, she is also focusing on our 2 children and does a wonderful job, I do wish she could understand what its like however and offer support.
I'm going back to my doctor on Saturday
Thanks for reading X

   Hi Everyone, this is my first ever post on this site. I'm going by the name Doolhof which in Dutch means Labyrinth or maze, not that I am Dutch, I just like the word! Some days I feel like I am in a labyrinth and have trouble knowing which way to turn, some days I feel like I am stuck in one place and just looking up at the walls wondering what is beyond, but having no energy at all to find out.
   As a teenager I felt like I knew where I wanted to be going in life, to be a Mum with 4 children, have a house near a beach, maybe a dog and a great relationship with a husband and my extended family.
   Four pregnancies and decades later I have no live babies, don't live anywhere near a beach, have a husband and a cat. I also have Borderline Personality Disorder, which makes life and relationships interesting, have a chronic back problem, and experience depression and loneliness, sometimes in almost overwhelming degrees.
   Part of me knows that my life is really great compared to what other people are going through, and then some days I think I am quite close to hell and no one has any idea how I am feeling. It frustrates me when the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and all I feel like doing is going to bed for the day as I have no enthusiasm to do anything else.
   For me, feeling lonely is one of the hardest emotions to live with, when my mind tells me that no one cares, when I feel like I don't have a friend in the whole world and who would miss me anyway if I did disappear? I am thankful I do have friends who care, sometimes my brain just tells me they don't.
   I have been reading some of the posts written by other people and have appreciated the openness to share thoughts and feelings, it has helped me to understand that other people go through similar things I do. A few of my family members and a friends do not understand depression much at all, and understand ""on going grief"" even less. 
   So many times I have been told to pull my socks up and get on with life. My answer to that is, that  if I could pull my socks all the way up to my head, some days I still would not be able to cope very well. Depression is not a thing you can turn off like a tap.
    How do others out there cope and deal with depression, grief and feelings of loneliness? I will be interested to see where this goes, to see where the labyrinth of life will lead me through the Beyond Blue connection.

Hi everyone, 
I just joined up, and I think I felt I had to because everything I was thinking and feeling was just being internalised. 
I know I have depression - I have seen doctors and am on medication - but for the last 6 weeks or so I have been feeling overwhelmingly alone and helpless. 
I always make a huge effort to see people, keep in contact and make others smile, but a while ago I wondered whether anybody would make that much effort with me. So I stopped. I decided I would talk to those who initiated contact and message when necessary, but would not go out of my way. 
Three people messaged me. In a month. One was asking for another friends phone number. My best friend knew I was in a bad place and still didn't contact me, nobody tried to make me smile. Everyone says they're busy. Hey, I work too. But if you have time to update your Facebook multiple times a day, or to sit down and eat or watch TV, then you have time to text a friend and see how they are, or ask someone how their day has been. I am so incredibly hurt because what I do for others, is apparently too hard for anyone to do for me. I feel helpless and worthless and I am just so incredibly tired of everything. 
I have hit the point where I don't wish I was dead, I just don't wish I was here either. I don't know if that will make sense to anyone. I just kind of want to disappear without causing a fuss. Just...be gone without anyone worrying. I know that isn't possible (I have family). It's so hard to explain.

Hi guys,
I haven't really got anywhere else to go, I have been fighting severe depression and anxiety since April. I was starting to make progress on it, regaining some confidence to step outside the house, but this morning a member of my family has sabotaged all that, making out that I can just get over it like that and I don't have a problem. I've had a massive downhill slide. This family member wonders why I become suicidal at times (I'm not currently). There's no point explaining to them because they won't listen to a word I say. I can't leave home because I can't afford to, but at the same time I can't cope with this anymore. I have barricaded myself in my bedroom and have not eaten at all today because I'm now too anxious to leave my bedroom or eat, lest this person starts again. I don't know what to do anymore. If I stay I won't get better, but I have no choice.

I had opened up to a friend about my illness and she suggested I join here. Finally did it - I guess these things take time. I was reading the forum names and I just started crying, which is odd for me. I guess it is confronting seeing so many people feeling like I do and all of your thoughts being displayed as a list through them. I find everyone just doesn't understand. Everyone has these wants and expectations of me and I just can't. I just can't. I know there are people who care about me but everyone is so caught up in their own lives and I guess I push people away... And people just don't understand. I think they compare how I feel to when they don't feel like getting out of bed. They don't know it feels to be physically, mentally and emotionally defeated by the pressure to be present. I've mostly stopped talking to people in the real world except my psych about anything because its too tiring explaining myself about everything. I say things (anything) and people respond but it's like it isn't a response to what I have said. They are always missing the point.I did the anxiety and depression test on here and it stuck me that I didn't know that people out there didn't struggle with these things.  It's so odd to think that that is possible. I ended up high range but I don't feel abnormal. I've started abusing prescription drugs when things get too too much. Particularly with my boyfriend, he takes my emotions personally and hates me self harming but the self-destruction and ""need to not be dealing with this"" mentality remains regardless. He gets defensive and aggressive and it starts a lot of arguments that I am usually too worn to want to remain conscious through.i feel trapped by it all and that makes me scared. I don't know how to make this stop.

I have recently been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I am a mum of 2 children (4&2). My husband I feel doesn't understand what I'm going through he just thinks coz I look ok I am ok. His response to everything is ""well everyone has crap going on"" which I totally get.
on the other hand my best friend has been amazing and really supportive being there listening to everything I need to say she really has been amazing.
now my husband has had a go at her saying she is sticking her nose in where it's not welcome.
understandable my best friend is angry and upset but now my husband has banded her from seeing my children coz he ""hates"" her.
im so lost as what to do. My husband thinks I should stick by him no matter what. But what do you do when you don't agree. I love my best friend who has always been there for me no matter what but i love my husband too.
i just feel like since I got diagnosed he just doesn't care about my feelings anymore

Not sure how to break the cycle of depression, negative/destructive thoughts. the catastrophizing.

just made some changes in my life to make it better. moved towns/states. change in relationship. change of workplace, same employer.

just found a new councillor, only had the one visit, seems quite good.
Need some advice on how to help break the cycle, just so alone, slowly meeting people and getting out and about. just feel so empty with no one to turn too. just so confused and overwhelmed at times. 2500 characters isn't enough room to type it all out lol

I have led a life of being the 'strong one'. Putting everyone else's problems before my own and wanting to help is just what I have always done. It's who I am. I put on a brave face and everyone around me sees a strong, independent person. Suddenly I sit here at 31, tight in the chest, feeling lost and unsure where to look for direction. I spent too long denying my own feelings and now I feel like I am the one who is unravelling. 
I am an Aries which makes me stubborn. Stubborn to the fact that I have been experiencing waves of what I was too proud to admit is more than likely some kind of depression. It's not life threatening but sometimes it can be paralysing, even if only for a day. It comes and goes and one day I can be plodding along ok and the next I can feel down enough to not want to get out of bed.
While the emotions I am feeling are real I also take on a great amount of guilt for feeling the way I do. Yes there's been things that have hurt me in the past, a long term relationship breakdown, a life time of family drama but nothing I ever considered significant enough to justify why I feel so miserable at times.
I think about so many other things that are wrong in the world and how many less fortunate people are out their surviving and it makes me mad for feeling the way I do. Maybe I am naive but I just don't understand it. How is it possible to feel so rough when most of the time you don't even know why? 
My brother was diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder which I feel was induced by his own drug addiction. He made and continues to make poor life choices and I have based my own life on working hard to be nothing like him. My mother is his saviour even though he treats her like a puppet on a string and she continually reminds me that mental health issues ""runs in the family"". I have never given in to the notion and sometimes I feel like our relationship would be better if I did use the Mental Health card like my brother so loosely throws around as an excuse for bad behaviour. 
I feel like I have spent my entire life trying to prove to myself that I am strong and that I would make better life choices than my siblings. I have spent so much of my energy setting such high expectations to be strong and shelving my own emotions that now I'm tired. Tired of being the together one. Tired of ""fixing"" everyone else and hiding behind their problems instead of facing my own. 
To those listening, thank you.

My depression has hit an all time low. On max dose of meds and still feel helpless, hopeless and unloveable. I was in a lovelss marriage for 6 years longer than I should've been, trying to make it work but it seemed that my ex wouldn't even meet me half way. This made me feel that I wasn't worth the effort. Been single for the last 3 years and dated a bit and agian the men made me feel used and unloveable. All I want is some companionship and to feel loved. I know this is not the be all and end all, I like myself, I am a loving, caring and affectionate person so what is wrong with me, why am I so unlovable to the opposite sex. I have been lonely and alone for nearly 10 years now. I have great kids, a job that I love, awesome supportive friends and family so why am I so depressed? I just don't understand

I went to see a counsellor the other day. For the first time, I have been able to see my depression 'in action', as it was happening. I recognised some of the destructive, hateful thoughts for what they were. Seems kinda weird that I've finally realised the destructive nature of these thoughts and seen them for what they are after so many years. But my mind-fog is pretty heavy some days.  She told me its an awesome thing to have this new 'clarity' on my depressive thinking. Now that I'm aware of it, I feel like I've given it a face, but I've also now made it more prominent in my consciousness... It's more powerful now than ever before. Today I want to leave this place more than I have in nearly 5 years andI' m frightened that I've reached this place again. Old guilt and shame have come flooding back anew, and my chest is heavy with the knowledge I'm so close. They are winning and I don't want to face anyone again with these forces controlling me. I cant face anyone again. I don't want to let my counsellor down, but I feel totally overwhelmed. Today at work I wanted to end it all.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

So here's my story so far. I feel I have to share it with somebody - somebody who knows what I'm feeling, can say been there done that, and hopefully come out the other side.Things were good till January.  I had a strong, happy, supportive family (still do), good job (more on that later), and everything seemed fine.Then out of the blue, the depression and anxiety appeared from nowhere.  I was an emotional wreck, barely functional some days, feeling like I wanted to curl up in a ball, cry, and make it all go away.  I had wonderful support from my wife, who said to see a professional, and I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety.  Take these little pink pills, and it will all go away. I stopped after a month - I don't want a pill to mask my problems, I want to know the root cause.A month later I saw a psychologist.  Waste of time.  She basically said I had a chemical imbalance, and to put a rubber band around my wrist, and flick it everytime I was having negative thoughts.  I haven't been back.I started to feel better.  Everything was looking up for a while.  But now, I'm back on the emotional rollercoaster again.  Tears are only a blink away, and I can't help but feel everything is blue.  I get emotional leaving my family in the mornings to go to work, can't concentrate for longer than 5 - 10 minutes while I'm in the office.I don't know why.  My boss (who knows the problem, and has been there) is supportive, but I dislike him intensely.  My wife is fantastic - fully supportive, compassionate and wanting to help.  My kids and I have a great relationship, and even though they're getting to the age where emotions in public are embarrassing, they're still happy to give their dear old (46 year old) Dad cuddles at bed time, despite being 10 and 12.I have things to look forward to.  We have a 4 week UK trip planned at the end of June, and I'm really looking forward to the break. We're financially independent, have good, safe jobs.. there is nothing that tells me why I should be feeling this way.But I go for a walk at lunchtime, and wonder whether being in an accident and being hospitalised for a period, will cause my life to be put on hold for a period, whilst I sort myself out.I'm seeing a new psychologist on Monday, but the negative Nancy in me says that she won't be able to help  me. She can't see inside my head, and tell me why it's all screwed up. I feel like nobody can help me, and I should just man up.  But I can't. The emotions are too close to the surface, and it's just a struggle to share this story, without breaking down in tears again.With me, the glass is never half full, it's half empty. Why get excited about the future, and be let down, when you can prepare for doom, and be enlightened when it doesn't happen?Does it get better?  Is there light at the end of the tunnel, or am I confined to these feelings for ever?I'd love to hear from anybody. Anybody who knows what I'm talking about. Can say they have been there done that, and whilst they may not be out the other side, can at least see the distant light at the end of the tunnel.

I have just registered. I have never been one to talk about my feelings so I suppose I have registered out of desperation. I feel as if I cannot tell anybody how down I am because I will just annoy them, I don't want to be a burden on my family and friends. 
I've gone from having good days and bad days to just having bad days. I can't get off the couch. I don't socialise anymore, I cant even respond to something as small as a text message. My feelings have changed from sadness to nothing at all. I don't care about anything anymore. I get desperate for human contact but I just cant make a phonecall. 
I don't know what I need. Ive been seeing a psychologist for 3 years. Two weeks ago I started back on medication again. I guess im just tired of feeling so alone. I see everyone else so happy and it makes me feel like a freak. Why cant I just be happy like them? Please help, I feel like I have nowhere else to go.

For a few weeks now I've been on an okay level. Once I'm out and about life's been okay. Suddenly it's changed for no good reason.
On and off I've had sleep problems with my depression and in the early days they caused me horrendous problems. If my sleep plays up I can become quite distressed.
On Thursday night I had problems getting to sleep. Then I kept waking and sleeping. So much so that on Friday I couldn't go to the charity shop where I help because I felt so rubbish. So on Friday night I took a sleeping tablet. Then last night I slept with nothing. Well I got 3and half hours. In Scotland it's midday now. I'm just crying and crying. My mind has gone crazy on me. I feel I've been shot down from the sky. Last week I had a couple of fantastic times and suddenly it's all gone. The sleep problem is all psychological but now I've got to try to get it back on track. 
Please could people answer as I don't want to ring my friends. My husband knows but is fairly dismissive and I don't want to talk to my family or anyone. I don't know why. 
The other week LING said she wanted to give up. We can't though. But I just wish it were possible because I feel so miserable.
Any support would be helpful.
Thanks, Helen

I have been feeling so depressed the last few weeks and I don't even know why, nothing has gotten worse, hasn't gotten better either but no worse than it was, im still inlove with somebody I can never have, hate my job, in debt to my eyeballs with nothing to show for it etc
but ive been getting really bad the last few weeks, im scared at the moment as I never drink but ive been drinking 5 nights in a row, I thought it was just because there was alcohol in the fridge but I went to the bottle tonight to buy more because I had ran out, so it is scaring me a bit, I have had a few alcoholics in my life and do not want to end up like that but I think I might be, I have been smoking pot a bit more to and when I don't have it I want it but most of the time I cant get it due to my dealer being caught, im not sure what to do, is it just a phase I will get over? because it is at the point that as soon as I walk in the door from work I start drinking until I go to bed and the other day I wanted to start drinking at lunch time, I didn't even start until like 6 on my 18th

Hi, just as I was leaving my GP's room he said a bit of community work would help me recover from depression and that my depression wasn't ""medical"".  I'm not sure what he meant by it not being medical, does anyone know?  I've been on medication for about 5 years.  If it's not MEDICAl, then why does he presribe me MEDICAtion?  Anyone else have a dismissive GP?

So quiet to the extent that you just give up sometimes, youngest of 4, lived with one parent from 2001-2003, graduated year 12, with rubbish marks, and a snapped ACL that wasn't operated on till Jan 2004. then July 2004 i did it again, there was a time during that period where i self-harmed, it was only minor, but i felt quite guilty afterwards and tried to keep it hidden from everyone. Then people call you names, and you don't bother calling them back, because you think your words will just go unnoticed.I feel im just rambling on so ill leave it here.beyondblue's clinically trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

been feeling really quite agitated over the weekend and today I have been teary off and on. called my boss to say i wouldnt be working today. I know Im not supposed to do that but it was just too hard this morning
went out with some friends on friday night and had quite a few drinks, 6 or 7 I lost count. I had a great time dancing and laughing and even singing karaoke. I was feeling great and in the back of my mind I wondered if it was maybe a bad thing cos my psychiatrist said that the problem with going up is that I will inevitabely come down hard. He said I shouldnt drink more that 2 or 3 at any one time but I guess I was feeling good and I didnt want the fun to end... guess Id better not do that again... 
also going to go back to taking my mood stabilizer early in the evening like i was in the hospital. it sucks cos they zonk me out and I lose my evening but I think in the long run I will be better for it
just called to get an appointment with my gp, next available is next week on the 7th... hoping I can feel alot better before then...

I have a huge problem and there's no way out of it, it's a big long hot mess of a problem and for years I've been trying to think a way out of it but every time I think I've got a way out it blows up in my face. I used to be such a happy person, even though my life has been way worse than it is right now even then I was happy in general. But this problem has just destroyed me. I never knew I could be so disabled by something. now I spend hours each day and night crying and I've thought about ending it almost every day for over a year.   No one knows though, In fact most people probably think I'm fairly happy, and on the rare occasions I'm around other people i do usually feel a little better. But I can't go out much and that never used to bother me. Wish I could go back to how I used to be. One night I came close to doing it..  well close-ish, I thought about doing it that night rather than just someday soon, but I didn't actually attempt or anything, and I wished I had someone to talk to, someone to tell me that there IS a way out, but I wouldfall apart the second I tried to talk about it, I HATE crying in front of people, yet I do it so easily, god it's so annoying, I'm never going to have the guts to call one of those hotlines, I just find it too embarrassing even though I know they've heard it all before, it's also why I most certainly couldn't talk to someone I KNOW .. That would be even more humiliating. I'd almost rather leave this earth than talk about itt to someone yet at the same time I want to so very badly.  Theres one thing that keeps me here, it's my dog. That's probably pretty disturbing to hear if you know that I have two children, but honestly I wouldn't be worried about them, they'll miss me I know, but they'll be taken care of and they'll get over it. But my dog who is on my lap almost all day, who follows me about the house as I do my stuff, she would just never get over it. And I'm lucky I have her I guess. She keeps me alive.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Been struggling with anxiety and bouts of depression the past 9 months.I was having mild panic attacks in meetings at work - nauseous, couldn't think straight or do public speaking. I was dizzy and would just freak out. Often I'd fake being 'sick' and explain my feeling off / nervousness by saying I was unwell. The prospect of a meeting brought on so much dread. Had some social anxiety, even with my best mates. I just felt off. Like a glass wall was between them and myself and I couldn't get through it. I couldn't be myself. I was seeing my pysch weekly over the past few months and then started on a low dose of medication. Had some side effects  - headaches, inability to concentrate, drowsiness and occasional thoughts of suicide. Have been on that for over a month and it was slowly wearing off and I was feeling more anxious and have up'd my dose  as per GP rec's. It's made me really irritable, depressed and I even lashed out at my ex partner last night and felt so terrible.This week I've had two nights where I have woken up in an absolute panic. Terror. So much anxiety and sadness. I can't stop crying. I've had to take the whole week off work. It's almost 4pm and I still haven't gotten out of bed this hasn't happened to me before like this ever. I have been lying here crying all day - feeling so alone and sad. Even though I have been reaching out to amazing friends who are there. I'm so lucky in lots of ways. But all I can think about is ending my own life.   This is so hard. I feel like a burden on my friends and workplace. I don't like my job and need to change. I'm not sure what to do. Take time off? How on earth do you get better? Should I stop giving the medication a go - it was working for a couple of weeks once the initial side-effects wore off... and I finally remembered what it was like to feel normal again. My life just feels so empty. I'm single. 30. A young woman with a great job. But I don't know where I'm going and what I want. I know my problems are petty compared to others doing it so much more tough - but this internal struggle is so dark and scary. I just want out. I wish it would go away. Does it get better? How does one break through the glass wall? Do suicidal thoughts wane? They scare me.  beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I need some help, I have been living with depression and anxiety for a while now and I am really struggling at this point, I have no motivation to do anything anymore, I have a good job, stable relationship and a roof over my head but I can't seem to shake the feeling that I'm just not good enough. I'm down all the time and I've even had to take days off work because of a mental breakdown. I don't want this to affect my relationship, my partner and I have been together for a year now and he's been very supportive but I don't want to keep putting him through my episodes of anxiety attacks and severe depressive states, I also don't want this to affect my job. They have also been very understanding through this difficult time but I don't want to turn up to work in tears and breathless before going home after half an hour of work.

My name is Debs and I'm 54. I'm coming on here in some anxiety. Can people answer my question and more importantly will my situation warrant the support I need, even the 'there, there' answers would help and obviously no reply doesn't. However it is the case that my depression doesn't need the help many people need.
So. 12 years ago I suffered a severe depression that was a living hell. I was gradually recovering when two years later I went into another, not just as bad, due to something happening. From there on I've been suffering from recurrent depression, sometimes with a few months between and once I had a years break.  At the end of January I woke one morning feeling low and there it was back. It is mild and has been getting milder over the years. But it is messing up my life because most of the time everything is an effort. I am no longer able to work (that's been for 6 years now) and so help in a charity shop which is a big help and distracts me quite well. I have a really good husband, good friends. My kids are grown up and I have 2 little grandsons. When I'm well I'm very happy and over the years have adjusted to a more limited lifestyle. But I can never reconcile myself to these episodes of depression. I can never feel confident they will pass and when I ask people how they know I'll get better they say 'because you always do'. The pattern of the depressions changes every so often; in length and anything between solid depression to good week/bad fortnight. Just now it's occasional good day.  
I take medication and can't have it increased. I've been told it's working (which I believe) and that these episodes are part of my chronic depression. By the way it usually comes for no reason. In fact life had been going very well prior to this episode. So, is it chemical. If it is what makes it go right again. If anyone knows I'd love the answer. Whilst I know there aren't any guarantees I respond quite well to logic.  As I've already said I feel uncomfortable. I know this is minor. But right now I'm wishing I could fast forward my life so that it was over and I could go in peace.

Hi guys after some advice here, I also just need to get some things off my chest and posting here is easier than trying to talk to people.
I practically spent all last year in a numb, apathetic state where I completely lost interest in everything important to me and I also avoided interacting with friends and family unless I absolutely had to. I spent my days distracting myself in any way possible and my nights were spent lying in bed just waiting and hoping that I'd fall asleep so my mind would stop wandering.
Mid December I started to feel a little bit better, probably because christmas was coming and I knew I was going to be spending it with my family. I felt like things were getting back on track and that I'd be ok again. Come late January, early February I felt miserable again for no reason I can think off. I remember one night broke down into tears one night for no reason, alone in my room. Nothing had triggered it, but on and off after that I had more cry spells and I felt terrible some days. I couldn’t sleep very well after that, and I sleep very little now.
Lately I've noticed that I've become somewhat worse, and sometimes I become very emotional when in public places and I feel as if I can’t hold it in. My health has also suffered I rarely sleep, I get migraines and have probably gained around 10 kilos. 
I don’t feel like I can trust anyone enough to tell them about how I’ve been feeling, although I think my stepmother suspects something is not right, even so I just can't bring myself to talk about it. I have no close friends; I haven't spoke to to most of them in a while and my so called best friend abruptly dropped contact for reasons unknown. I feel that even if I were stll close to any of them, I still couldn’t tell them
I've been to see a GP and had a mental health plan prepared, and saw a psychologist once (second appt in 2 weeks) 
I just don't know what is wrong, I remember periods of feeling down and depressed constantly for months at a time, other times I remember feeling on top of the world. Like I was invincible or nothing could stop me.

I don't even know where to begin. Today I woke up just really upset and I started crying. I've had a few of these episodes but today felt the worse. It's all a feeling of guilt, worthlessness and a lot of other things.
What really gets me down the most is thinking of my partner who has been so supportive. I hate the fact that I feel like I can't make him as happy as he should. I notice when I am just snappy and irritable towards him, I sometimes see the look of hopelessness in face and then I think about why he's even sticking around and dealing with me. He tells me he's not going anywhere and I believe him but I think he just offers me so much more than I can offer him.
At the moment I am working part time after getting made redundant from my last job. I've found it hard to find full time work and while the job I'm in now is not ideal, it's paying the bills. So some feeling of hopelessness and being stuck stems from the job I'm in and not being able to find full-time work. There has also been a massive pay difference from my old job to this new one so that's also a contributing factor to feeling down.
In all honesty, the job thing is such small potatoes when I look at the big picture. I have a loving partner, I'm close with my family and friends and I get along amazingly with my partners family. I have everything that I want and more. When I am in the right headspace, I can step back and be so thankful for everything that I have. My family and friends don't know about my depression so I think they think that my life is perfect, though I don't pretend my life is perfect, I have just never told them that I've seen a psychiatrist for help in the past.
I stopped seeing the psychiatrist after a few sessions as I couldn't make my last appointment cos of work and I thought I was feeling and coping a lot better. Only to realize that I didn't just develop depression recently, I think I've had it for a few years now and due to the redundancy situation and not working for 10 months just gave it a lot of time to boil and worsen.
I took the day off work today cos I couldn't stop crying in the morning and I have this immense guilt from not going to work. They know that I've been having personal issues but at the same time I can't expect them to just keep understanding. I guess I'm afraid that they'll ask me to step down from my role.
I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for taking the time to read.

Hi everyone
Well here I am again - back in hospital.  Don't know if it's a good or bad thing.  But I'm here and I am going to take as much rest as I can, do as many group sessions as possible.
I'm in a shared room and it is so weird - 3 of us who were here in April are all in today and we are in the same room!!!
I felt very withdrawn and nervous this morning, but as the day is going on I am not too bad.
I will keep you all updated.
Take care everyone, I have limited access to computer, so I will try and come on quickly every day.
Jo xxx

I'm studying myself...observing when I fall into depression, the symptoms, the lead up to it and how I get out of it. 
So, wife and I on holiday up north- sunshine coast. Staying with friends. Yesterday wife went out shopping and as she took our car I was..well marooned, stuck at this nice place but there is a limit to what you can do at a friends house alone. With boredom during the day I rang my wife for her to bring the newspaper. She returned and forgot it. We are too far to go driving just for the paper so I didnt bother.
This morning I woke up having had a really bad dream. I dont know if it was the result of the dream or not enough sleep from dreaming but I woke up in a bad mood. We had planned a day out and I asked my wife if we could start the day with brekky at a cafe. No, she didnt consider it at all. So we had coffee and the conversation with our friends lingered on and on. Eventually my mood fouled more and I announced to my wife- ""we leave in 5 minutes or I leave by myself"".
We left in a few minutes and started our day at a cafe but the depression had well and truly set in. By this time I was trying to feel the change in my brain. Started to study my body for reasons that set off the mood. Was it-
-the bad dream
-lack of sound sleep
-boredom the day before leading to impatience this morning
-my wife's lack of knowing how needy I was to get on the road
-my depression cycle coming around
-music....I had the tune of the bodyguard in my head...I'm a sucker for sad tunes. 
-being away from home in Victoria 
We had been at our friends for one week. We'd been camping for 3 days happily and the following 4 days we great, jovial, laughing - perfect atmosphere.
What I do know. Is that my wife is not to blame. My communication was reasonable and my sense of urgency was obvious. But my impatience came around really quickly..in fact it came during our drinking our coffee, within a 5 minute period.
Medication has been great and am on the maximum of the mood stabiliser prescribed. An anti depressant is ok and prefer not to take a higher dosage.
Also my feelings just after I lost patience was like my eyes were welling up. 10 years ago I would have cried for hours and had headaches from that. But the flushed feeling I had this morning might be due to the chemical reaction causing the depression?????  Does anyone else have this flushed feel?
How many of you can relate to the above circumstances listed as being a trigger for depression.? and out of it after 8  hours.

Hello,
I am almost reluctant to post this, given that I don't think I am actually clinically depressed or suffering from any particular mental illness. But sources of sadness, frustration and regret in my life have slowly accumulated to a point where they are affecting my physical wellbeing. 
I don't want to join any kind of support group - I would feel like a complete phony, because my depression is purely circumstantial, not clinical at all. I would normally even categorise myself as an optimist. All I really think I need is a sympathetic ear - someone who will listen without judging or jumping to unnecessary conclusions, and WITHOUT trying to shove drugs down my throat. If I were religious, I would just go have a chat with my local clergy-person. It's that kind of casual understanding that I feel I need, which unfortunately is very hard to find for modern, secular professional types who have difficulty making friends.
I'm looking for any suggestions or recommendations - I'm not sure if individual therapists are allowed to be named in this forum, but if so, hopefully I'm allowed to at least say that I live and work in Melbourne's eastern suburbs. A bit to the north, and not too far into the 'sticks'. Thanks.

I find it hard to explain anything about how I’m feeling, because to be honest I really don’t know anymore.

I use to have depression during primary and high school, but thanks to a couple of great relationships in my past things improved and I was able to get past that, there was once a point where I’d say I was free of depression and was just trying to work through the secondary problems my depression had created, such as poor memory and social skills.

But ever since my relationship with my ex failed two years ago I have slowly been spiralling down hill. It has been around 15 years since I have been this bad with my depression to the point that I am finding myself in tears every day and wanting to pass out too fee myself from the feeling of emptiness and pain I feel.

I have tried so many different things to get myself on track since the break up, from attending various social clubs, immersing myself in work, spending time with family, following hobbies, dating sites… whatever I do, I just have no interest and to be honest all these things actually make me feel worse.

While my memory is shot as my head tries frantically to cope with this pain; I still know of the feelings of bliss I felt every time my ex smiled and nothing these past two years can remotely compare or turn me around so fast. I think that is why I feel nothing when I do these “social” things. As much as I wish things worked, I understand that she wanted to follow her spiritual needs and going our separate ways was probably inevitable.

I have been in love and engaged before and breaking up has always been horrible, but I can’t turn myself around this time as I fall deeper into the darkness. I feel so alone as I walk through this town with no people.

Hi all,
Have been treated for depression with ad meds for the past 15 years or so. Was always on the same low dose till about 12 months ago when things started to go down hill. Then in recent months Ive been on a roller coaster merry go round of alternating highs and lows.
Yesterday I was voluntarily admitted to Perth Clinic and my diagnosis has been changed from depression to bipolar2. This is no great surprise to me as my gp mentioned that this might be the case. I have stopped the ad meds and last nite started on mood stabilizers. I am hoping that these, along with the skills & techniques I hope to learn throgh groups & individual therapy here will restore some balance in my world.
Hope everyone is having a good day

Hi, I am so not used to write about my problems or talk about it. I was brought up that way. You don't really talk about yourself and you are definitely not a burden to anyone so I am sorry if my writing is a little confusing. People see me as a very strong person that never needs help but the truth is that I am so unhappy and have this rage of hopeless inside me. 
I think I have had depression most of my life but now when life is a lot more busier with small kids it appears a lot more. I love and adore my kids and I have a wonderful husband that would do anything for me. But..... Here is my thing... I have fibromyalgia (chronic fatigue, pain)  depression and I also have a sugar addiction which no one takes really serious. Hey even I find it weird sometimes but it's real. All three of them come together. Sugar makes me very bad and my pains become worse. When my pain is bad, my depression becomes really bad. It's like a black circle that I can't get out of. 
I have worked really hard the last years to get my body on track and I think I have my pain and other things on track but it's the depression and the sugar addiction that is really hard to take on. I have been to therapists but they don't really take me seriously..Let me explain. I know my problem and I am asking and answering myself when I am at a therapist. The ones I have been to always says. ""You know what to do and you are strong"". I am a little tired of hearing that because I do feel hopeless many times and my head is just black with uninvited ""guests"", as I call them, talking bad things. Really bad thoughts about myself. I cry a lot and I am trying to talk to my husband about it but it's not always easy to really tell what you feel. 
I have been through a lot in my life and when I feel good I feel like a survivor and I'm strong. But when I'm in my black cloud I feel very weak and just want to disappear. Feels like my family would be better without me. I know it's my brain and the uninvited guests talking and not my heart but it's really tiring and difficult to feel all this while trying to keep up work, house, kids and life in general. 
For me all this is really real. I do keep going but I have become very good in keeping up appearance. People do not see it on me. Even my husband don't see it many times until I have a panic attack or I am just crying. 
I hope that I make a little sense. For me.. I just need to talk about it sometimes, to get the screaming voices in my head out. 
Thank you

Here goes, anyone who knows me thinks I'm a happy, confident caring person. And being a nurse my job requires such qualities, being a mother requires this, being a wife requires this and so I play this role, I want to be like this but the reality is I am dying inside, always anxious and nervous feeling over whelmed all the time. I am tired of acting, I'm tired of anxiety attacks and tired of feeling sad for no reason. I have to push myself to be motivated not out of wanting its a necessity when the truth is I could gladly just curl up in bed all day and withdraw from society, family and friends. And what is sadder no one can tell.

It's been a while.  Every morning I wake up with my stomach in knots and I even wake up during the night like I want to be sick.  Eventually I get the courage to put one foot in front of the other and attempt to face the day.  By the time I make it into work I feel overwhelmed and like I can't do my job.  
I always seem to be on edge.  I've been reading a book about CBT and I find it quite helpful at that moment but then by the next day, whatever I've read is out the window and my feeling of downness returns.
I have a super supportive husband and he is so encouraging and I feel like I'm really letting him down by being this way.  Not sure what he did to deserve me, but I am grateful he is my partner in life.
Not even sure why I wrote this .... just wanted to get it off my chest I suppose.

I am so tired, so sad, so fed up. I just want to go away. I want to find a retreat where I can talk to someone who can help. I am feeling so unloved and cared for. I can't keep this up. I have pulled back from all my friends and have no-one. No one wants to know about it any more. It is not my fault I am soooo down. You have no idea how close I have come to not  being here. 
I am so stuck I don't know what to do. My doctor has been changing my meds and I am seeing a physc tomorrow. I know everyone will say hang in there. Give the meds a chance but I am over it. I have been suffering depression for 40 years now and I am sick of being sick. Sick of no-one understanding. Here we go again and again and again. I don't want to be like this and there is nowhere to go. I need 24/7 at the moment. Physc ward doesn't want me. I'm sad not mad. Why isn't there somewhere we can go and stay and get help without it being a physc  ward. That's not the right place when you are down.       I don't know where to go from here.

I'm not expecting anyone to read this, and not needing anyone to reply. I see a professional, I take my medication, I just really need a safe, anonymous place to let my feelings out. Here goes.  I'm 36. I've been battling depression since I was 15, and I think it's winning. I don't have any horrible stories, or shocking childhood events behind my depression, it's just always been there. I met my husband when I was 19, married at 24, and now we have 4 beautiful kids. And it's not enough to stop me from wanting to not exist. I don't want to get out of bed. I don't want to get dressed. I don't want to make meals, or do the washing, or clean the house. I just want to not wake up in the morning. I've been to several doctors. I've been on several medications - to the point where my current Dr has recommended I never go off them again. And it's just not working. I hate myself and I don't see that I'm worth putting any effort into. I don't understand what my friends possibly see in me that is worth liking. I'm the most useless mother on the planet, and I honestly feel sorry for my kids that they got stuck with me. My marriage is not great. I feel like my husband would rather be anywhere than here - and that must be my fault. I'm not good enough. And I get so angry with him - he's always working, he doesn't help me with any of the household chores, if I ask him to do something, his answer is always ""sure"" and then he never does it, and now I find myself not even bothering to ask for his help and then resenting him for making me do it all on my own. My ways of dealing with my feelings are eating, drinking and self harm - and I pretend to everyone else that I'm ok because I don't believe that they actually want to hear any of my problems. I think a lot about killing myself, but I know I'd never have the guts. I have some hobbies that, at times, I really enjoy doing, but then I look at the results and they are so rubbish that I wonder why I bothered in the first place. I just feel that everyone in my life would be better off without me - I wouldn't be screwing up my kids lives, my husband wouldn't have to put up with me, my friends would be able to spend time with others and not have to baby me and my stupid meltdowns. There is not one positive, useful thing I contribute...so honestly, what is the point of me?? I'm taking up valuable air and space and resources.. and I should just not.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hello everyone, this is my first time posting and it's really my first step towards actually trying to get help.When I was 15 I went to see a councillor butI was scared of being told I was crazy so I lied about how I felt. Then I saw a psychologist when I was 17 and when I got there I started to leave out a lot of things, like when she asked if I ever had suicidal thoughts I just said no, even though I think about killing myself every day. I was, and am, just so scared of being told there is something wrong with me. Then early last year I tried again to get help. I was open with my psychologist, she told me I had depression and anxiety but after every session I would go home and hurt myself because I felt like such a loser, so I stopped going. I just so desperately want to wake up tomorrow and stop feeling and thinking these things. I think each day that passes I feel myself getting worse and worse.. I'm starting to go into hazes where I don't even feel like I exist and I feel like I can't move my body.  I know I have to get help but I' m scared of it all being real. I want to stop feeling these things, and I want to feel normal. I realise now that I'll never just wake up and all this be gone, so I know I have to get help. I wanted to ask if anyone has any advice on how I should go about seeking help? And also does anyone have advice on how to deal with being diagnosed, because I am worried that getting a proper diagnoses will make me break and scare me away again. Thank you

I have been depressed for about 3 and a half years now and was just recently put on to antidepressants. Overall they have helped a lot by removing most of my depressing thoughts but one has remained and I think about it everyday which is driving me crazy. However i don’t want to completely get rid of it because while it is one of my saddest memories it was also a part of the happiest time in my life. Im not sure what to do. Any thoughts?

Morning, I have struggled with depression for the last couple of years, I was able to recognise that there was something wrong pretty quickly and sort help from my GP, who put me through a mental health plan, put me on medication & recommended a physc, which I was a little reluctant to go to so put it off for ages. The first lot of medication recommended by my GP worked for a little while but got to the point where we had reached the maximum dosage for that brand, so changed medication, which seems to be helping but still a very high dose apparently. It's a funny thing depression, I'm one of these depressed people that people would have no clue I suffer from it.. Before I was diagnosed I had a group of people that I loved going out with at the end of the working week & having a quite drink or ten with to unwind, but when I was diagnosed I felt I needed to give up the drinking, so that I had control of at least a little of my thoughts, but in giving away the drinking I also lost those friendships, which shattered me at the time & of course added to the depression.
I chose not to tell a lot of people about the depression cause that wasn't who I was, but the one friend whom I did choose to tell was a very new friend, but made me feel comfortable enough to talk with her & throughout the last couple of years has been a constant support to me, we've had some great conversations, I'm not generally a talker, to the point where I was surprised she hadn't given up on me, well I think that time has finally come & I'm not quite sure how to handle it. She was the type of friend that would contact me every couple of days to see how I was going, even when on holidays & I loved that, it made me feel good.
The last lot of holidays, I didn't hear from her as I normally would so thought that I would ask why, couldn't quite get a straight answer or maybe the truth & this really frustrated me, it frustrated me to the point that I got quite upset & said things I wouldn't normally say, not nasty things but things that seemed true to me..I felt the rules had been changed & somebody forgot to tell me.
Of course there's a lot more that goes with this story but you can only type so much. This is a friendship I DO NOT want to loose.
Its a very true friendship to me because it wasn't built on drunken conversation as my past ones were..if it's over I'll be absolutely shattered.......How do I fix this??

Hi, I am 34 years old this year. I've suffered from depression since I was a teenager. I found a spiritual practice when I was 20 which pulled me out of drags and gave me a lot of happiness, but in an effort to prove how much I had mended my ways, I rushed into marriage and had a child at 23. Even before my child was born, I knew I didn't really love my husband and wanted to leave, but I am so disappointed in the lack of commitment to marriage across the society that I vowed I could make it work, rich or poor etc. The main issue is that my husband and I have nothing in common and I couldn't even call him a friend, even though he's a good person. I keep trying to hold it together, especially after hearing all the terrible stories of children who face divorce, and having been through suicidal depression during my own teenage years, I don't want to do anything to harm my son. At the same time, my life is slipping away... I can't bring myself to have sex with my husband in order to have another child, even though I've tried to convince myself to 3-4 times in the past 11 years. It pains me so much that my son doesn't have a sibling, and that I will never have another child, yet to bring another child into our family is just a shame anyway. 
My husband doesn't understand how serious it is for me. He's really really slow, he can barely read or write, and I'm too sharp to the point where nothing is simple. We now live overseas, but my family are still in Australia. When I'm away from him and go back to my parents, I feel like I'm myself again and I don't even want to remember that he exists. I feel homesick constantly and always dream of my teenage years... like I'm still stuck there. All these years of life don't exist in my subconscious mind. I've barely ever even dreamed of my son. I just want my mum and dad like a little child. I have no confidence in my husband whatsoever, and because I have never done anything myself, and have spent most of these years alone at home without a car, I don't even know how to live a life, or what I like, I don't know the feeling of achieving anything, and I've lost all motivation to put my heart and soul into anything. I feel like a psychological prisoner and I just can't normalize. It doesn't change year after year. 
I'm considering going home for a year, but because I've been depressed for so long - more than 2/3 of my life... I just don't know if it's how I am and if it will ever change. And that's my character limit.

I've been feeling so low for so long. The thought that I'm only half way through this cliched life is like a brick around my neck.I've been to doctors, one said ""I'm depressed, you're depressed, we're all depressed"" She basically told me to get over myself. Then I saw some supposed top notch psychologist and he too said I wasn't depressed but just had bad family using me up. I sob myself to sleep every night, I am filling with more and more hate and anger. . I feel like the outside version of me everyone is seeing is getting further and further from the real me. The one I must keep secret. My family are trying to help I guess, but whenever they contact me I just feel even worse after. I feel they judge me. They really don't need to, my self loathing conversations in front of the mirror far outweigh what they could come up with. I read to do this mirror thing, as a positive thing, say loving things to yourself. But I tried and discovered I just couldn't say anything nice.I get overwhelmed with such hatred at that thing looking back, that horrid ugly unlovable blob.I'm living in a pigsty, day after day I'm determined to clean up my mess... tomorrow. But I don't, instead I just eat.There is not an ounce of anything to look forward to. I'm getting deeper and deeper in this pit and I can't get out.I'm sorry to be a self-pitying pathetic whinger, I don't see what typing this can do, but the typing it has actually helped a little.

Hi. Ivehit rock bottom, I mean really rock bottom with Depression and anxiety and no life because of it. Im a male, turning 40 in a few months which I suspect its the big wake up call about all the problems I have to face and its overwhelming. Im really going through a serious breakdown and Im so so alone and unable to see what to do next, a life or future. A bit of backstory to show the major points of how I got here and struggling every hour to hold it together. Undiagnosed with GAD, male, Australian growing up was hell, anxiety attacks at school everyday, bullied ofc, extreme difficulty's making friends and a broken home all came crashing in my first real mental breakdown at 17. My father threw me out and I got on a plane in a broken haze to move in with my grandmother from perth to melbourne in 93. My life was destroyed from that point on and I fell into hiding, self blame ever since and cut myself off from family since. Instead of living a full life in my 20s and 30 Ive been here, under her protection as she is a widower and needed someone so.. this life has been just that, hiding, doing as little as I can to get by from fear. I watched friends I made in school grow up, meet girls, get married, have kids and get jobs and careers and I looked on in awe. But when they did have the family unit I started pushing away, cause I didnt want them to see the real me.  Ive no career training or real abilities I can use to get work, all my tafe and further education I put myself in are now all redundant. The only Time I did work professionally was as a webmaster in advertising for 2 years but that was horrific, the stress broke me again and they had to fire me. I didnt recover from that. that was about 5 years ago, and trying to stay on centerlink has been hell cause they dont understand or recognize they real help I need. My grandmothers 88 and shes so worried and there might not be much time left, my mom is on dialysis 3 times a week and doesnt have long either and I couldn't cope alone, even getting income, facing death again after losing a friend and girlfriend overseas last year Im just.. broken. Failed to begin a life. hitting 40, realizing ive been hording and hiding so so long and a dozen other serious problems hitting me all at once. So I saw my GP yesterday and got onto antidepressants again, I have a referral to a physiologist but.. I dont think thats going to be near enough. I need.. advise.. help.. no family or real friends left to rely on.

Hi, 
just wondering what people think is best. 
When you feel anti social and don't want to leave the house / go out etc (just socially I still go to work every day without issue) is it best to push through and 'force' yourself to go? Or is it ok to allow yourself to retreat and hide for a while? 
Im not sure if allowing yourself to withdraw will make it worse and create a bigger problem. If u hide for a while is it harder to come back out?

We are about to lose our farm because I cant get a job .  and even the doctors no I have a problem but wont do any thing to help me . Why am I so sad and bitter all the time . I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up

Hi, I'm just after some advice so that I can understand what to expect. I've been having strong suicidal ideation for at least a month now and also self harming to help when agitated or the thoughts are overwhelming. My counselor referred me to mental health several times and is concerned. I met with a new case manager on Tuesday and she indicated that I needed to consider either medication or hospital or I was very close to the choice being taken out of my hands. I have a huge amount of anxiety regarding medication, so agreed to try hospital. I have 2 weeks holidays now and was hoping I could use this time to get myself back on track without impacting my work. While very worried I was also incredibly relieved that someone else would be responsible for keeping me safe and I would have a break from constantly fighting the urges and thoughts. She then finally let me know Friday night that the program she has wanted to get me into wouldn't accept me as I'm too high risk (they are a sub-acute program) and my issues would be too distressing for others there. So my case worker said she had made an appointment for me for the mental health psych in a month! So I'm too high risk for hospital, so they wont see me for a month. And just Tuesday she told me they are very worried about me but now I'm left to fend for myself for a whole month.  Anyway...I spoke to my original counselor and she has suggested I just present to hospital. I'm really nervous about sitting for hours in emergency. Also, while I have made plans forsuicide they are not immediate though I have been harming, I don't know if they'll admit you through emergency unless you're imminently about to do something if they let you walk back out the hospital doors. Also do I pack a bag in case I'm admitted? Is that weird? It hardly screams desperation if I rock up with my toothbrush and pj's. I'm rational and not out of my mind, I'm just exhausted from constantly fighting this and don't know how much longer I can hold out. My family doesn't really want to find out either. I just need someone to help me.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

HiI'm new to this forum.male 55 year old, three adult kids. Married but live alone. I'm useless. I have no interpersonal skills.  I have had depression all my life but only been prepared to recognised it in the last couple of years. I've never really had a friend, always the third wheel in everything. Use to kid myself that I had friends but never really seemed to be liked very much.  No one ever seems to remembers my name or that they previously met me. I have had sum unfortunate interactions with people when out so I don't go anywhere now, except the chemist and grocery shopping each month. I fear interaction with others and feel they think I'm a waste of time. Its easier to stay at home and avoid seeing anyone. But it does get lonely. I'm always anxious and expect any contact will lead to me irritating someone and have them abuse me. It seems to happen a lot. For example I was walking along the footpath at the shops when a middle aged woman pulled up along side of me opened the passenger window of her car lent across a young girl in the passenger seat and said ""smile it carn't be that bad"" shook her head and drove off. Things like that knock me around for days, sometimes weeks. I play it over and over in my head trying to work out what I do to have it happen. I have no idea how to interact with people anymore.  Most people dream of what they would do winning lotto as a release from reality. My way of relief from life is dreaming of ending it. Typing this and opening myself up for ridicule has taken a big effort.

Can you relate? 
 
No one notices how upset I am. 
Sometimes, I don't even think I notice.
I feel miserable. I just can't be bothered doing anything... 
I need someone to talk to. I just want someone who understands. 
It seems like every decision I make, good or bad, there is no one on my side. For example, I quit my job today (just a weekend job, I have another job) because I wasn't happy. All anyone can say is, ""that was wrong, why did you do that, you're an idiot"" even my family says this. It would be nice for someone to say, ""I'm sure you made the right choice or as long as you're happy"" 
I just wish I could talk to someone without being judged. I just want someone to understand me. Not even my own family can accomplish this small task. 
I'm not sure if I'm depressed. My sister has depression. 
Here's how I feel right now:
Tired, unmotivated, sore, sleepy, sad, misunderstood and stupid.
I haven't eaten all day and I'm not hungry. I want to get up and do something but I just can't find the energy to do so. 
I can't tell anyone how I feel because I don't want to be laughed at. My family will say 'how ridiculous, you're not upset'  when really, inside, I'm dying. What is wrong with me?
Also I have times when I'm in a really good mood and I'm really confident and then I have times when I'm quite depressed.

I've really been trying. I did everything I was told to do but somehow it still feels like I'm plagued by the overwhelming shadow of badluck. I spend a lot of time trying to convince myself that it is just the way I feel and that the 'badluck' isn't actually real. However.. it's becoming a lot more difficult to rationalise that to myself as of late. I guess my back story is that I'm a victim of childhood neglect and have had depression for as long as I can remember. I do not have a supportive family and really want nothing to do with them. For the first time in my 18yrs + of depression I sought the help of a doctor. I got a mental care plan etc etc. A month ago, my psychologist went into surgery and is on somewhat of an indefinite hiatus. The anti-depressants (in my opinion) have absolutely not effect. But back to my sudden string of confounding badluck... I missed my psychiatrists appointment due to sleeping through several alarms; a first for me. Sleep is something that has eluded me for the good part of at least 10 years and is a constant struggle to figure it out. I.e. I can fall asleep but my sleep is really poor quality, my nights are filled with dreams that don't quite allow me any peace. When people say ""it was such a good sleep"" or ""I feel so refreshed after that sleep""I have no idea what that feeling is like and I crave it so badly. No matter how hard I try, my sleep always falls out of patterns, my life becomes less active and I end up spending the majority of my time in my bed. I hate the constant fatigue, the unquenchable feeling of wanting to be asleep hoping it will rejuvenate my mind after awakening.I planned on doing tai chi to help the anxiety to calm my mind; didn't happen due to mixing up the times. Missed a psychiatrists appointment due to a phenomena foreign to me; failing to study for an exam I have in a week due to such an inactive regime. I feel like I just need a break. For everyone to get off my back, let me laze around for a few weeks. Let me figure out my own mind; however this 'badluck' is making it all the worse. Not to mention the financial woes it keeps impacting upon me. I'm 22, yet I feel as though I have the troubles of one twice my age and experience. I don't even know who or what I am anymore. The suicidal thoughts were kept at bay thanks to the antidepressants, however that gate has since been destroyed and I'm intoxicated  with new ways to end it all. I need some advice.

I want to say sorry for disappearing after my recent post. I am most grateful for the support and good advice I was given but did not respond to. I've had a terrible shock and am now very sick with a flare up of my autoimmune disease from the stress. My ex husband is OK but....He (we have been living apart for 6 months) came to our house, and while I was out, attempted suicide. He was finally found by the police in hospital. He had called an ambulance. I spent most of the week at the hospital with him as he kept asking for me. I was literally spoon feeding him and helping him to walk.Now I am home, with a massive flare up of my illness and heartbroken again as despite having to deal with his suicide attempt, I am only a friend. I don't want to be in a relationship with a man who treats me as he does, and my head is too sensible to let him come back even if he wanted to, but my heart is shattered. I'm angry he has hurt me again. His depression is not my responsibility anymore and he has already hurt me so much. He should not have left me to deal with it all.My life is a nightmare as it is. I'm in constant pain, have seizures that prevent me from driving and despite working 2 days a week, I am scrounging a living well below the poverty line. I chafe against the restrictions of my pathetic little life. I am only 43 and I am reduced to reading, knitting and watching TV in the endless days and nights when my beloved family and friends are out living their own lives and I hate it. I don't want to be a burden on them so I mostly keep it to myself but I am profoundly miserable. Sometimes I even struggle to do something as simple as make a cup of tea (scalded myself when I passed out pouring water from the kettle the other night).I have tried to help myself, to find positives, reaching out to friends, working for charities etc but it's not enough.I have spoken to psychs and counsellors and am taking 3 antidepressants.Nothing helps and all I get told is to keep on going. I won't suicide. I can't bring myself to hurt my family but I desperately want out of this life. I feel so trapped.I am trying so hard... but I am so over it all. Thanks for ""listening""

Hi
i sufferer from chronic generalised anxiety, PTSD and mild depression. The last two or three weeks I have been struggling to be happy. I can't be bothered doing anything, going anywhere and have to push myself to just do things around the house. I am on medication for this condition so it seems to stabilise me somewhat but as i said, I have been feeling worse. I know what my doctor will say, lose weight, do exercise, plenty of rest and eat healthily. I'm unsure if I should go and visit him and let him know I have become worse.

Considering the following 3 facts:1) Imagine this universe as a graph, with time on the x axis and the sum of all happiness of all living things, except me, on the y axis. My only goal in life is, and always has been to get the area under that graph as large as possible.2) I am 39, single and don't see any possibility of having a family no matter how much I want that to be the case. I hate daylight, daytime and most of all, being awake, making deep sleep the safest and the only enjoyable part of my life. So I have come to realise that every single waking decision and action that I take actually lowers the area under the graph in point 1.3) I am 100% sure that my universe ceases to exist when I'm gone, making the graph in point 1 null and void.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all,
I just reread the community rules to check if this topic is appropriate,  it appears that as long as I feel comfortable sharing with a stranger then im safe. I will however choose my words wisely. I apologise if this has been discussed before, I couldnt find any similar threads.
My partner and I have been together 5 years and are both very much in love. There is only one slight issue and thats loss of intimacy. I say loss because I know it was healthy before. My partner has taken on the role of my carer while ive been battling with mental illness and now I have this strange feeling that he finds it difficult to be intimate with me. Ok, its not strange, its real. 
Over the past 6 months ive found myself having to raise the issue with on a monthly basis him to reengage in intimate acts. So here we are 6 months down the track and I think if I dont raise it again it will never happen. The problem is I dont want to have to ask for it or have discussions about it all the time. Firstly it leaves no room for spontaneity,  and secondly it leaves me feeling very undesired. 
In the past he's mentioned the scars I have make him sad but unfortunately I cant remove them. Ive also put on weight thanks to medication and lifestyle changes, but he consistently tells me he still loves me. I dont want a brother or a friend, I want my partner back, but because I feel like my mental health is such a strain on him I dont want to force him to do anything he doesnt want to. 
My Psychiatrist informed me that my medication could result in loss of libido but fortunately (or in my case unfortunately) its had the exact opposite effect. 
Does anyone have some words of wisdom that they'd be comfortable to share.
Thanks:)

Hi, Not sure what I'm looking for here? About 2 years ago finally got the label that I suffered PTSD with depression, after a lifetime (just about it seems) all of a sudden things started to make sense. I wasn't going crazy, there was actually a name for the looney toon I thought I was! I have been through numerous counselling sessions, just last year the psychologist who helped really identify things for me. But as we know 10 sessions goes real fast. Really struggle day to day just getting through life, feeling and doing and motivating myself. I tend to stay home, don't ring people don't socialise. My life enjoyment is not there and don't feel emotion often.  I'm my own worst enemy as I wont go on normal drugs, just lately have been trialling natural remedies and don't sIeep although tired. Just basically stopped enjoying life. I hold down a job doing rotating rosters which helps me get up each day.I struggle to deal with large amounts of people around (although if I'm in the right head space I can do it .. weird woman I am)
I always on high alert in social gatherings, stomach churns etc. 
II have wonderful children and grandchildren who are there for me, but I spend half my time hiding who I really am.. just because I don't want to hurt them or for them to worry.
 I don't even know what I'm looking for..sometimes none of it makes sense

I was just wondering if i could get some ideas on how to cope with feeling down? I mean its easy enough to read all the stuff on the web but is there someing that really helps you? I find i have no energy to do anything and it takes me ages to get up and go. What kind of rewards do you give yourselfs? Chocolate, a night out?

I don't know how to start I'm getting very angry easily especially with my son and family  who are getting on my nerves about little things when I have been doing good they don't see that.  I don't know if it's my new meds but I just wanna cry and crawl into a hole. I hate feeling like this. I've posted on here b4 and I was coping alrite earlier but it just takes one negative comment or my son to not listen to me and I'm a complete mess and everyone sees it. I'm sick of feeling soo helpless to this condition and really need to see my psychiatrist who I'm following up on with my GP tomoro. I just need to calm down. I love my son dearly but the thought of having him for another week makes me feel sick, anxious and depressed. I feel like a failure as a mum to think that. Really need some positive outlooks and or plan for the next few days to keep myself and my son busy during the school holidays that doesn't include money as that is a big problem atm.

Some days I wouldn't have a clue. I've said to people close to me that I couldn't organise a fight at a boxing tournament!
This is my first post. I'm early 60's married 36 years,3 kids and 10 grandchildren. Yet, it's a struggle every day to find a reason to go on.But I do.The best thing I do is to let go and surrender things into God's hands. This what AA members do so my friends have told me.
Can someone tell me what I'm supposed to do about my wife who absolutely refuses to go to counselling with me and has even not turned up at only appointment which she made.She says we've been to counselling but that was 25 years ago.I need to be able to speak about what's causing me to be very depressed and can't. An argument is no good because I can't win it anyway.
Don't get me wrong I don't mean to blame her as I have enough in my early life which caused anxiety then and depression now I'm older.She is not the cause of my depression but certainly is a contributor to it being a lot worse.
What do I do? Leave and tear the family apart?

I have been unable to understand what Depression is about.  My daughter has suffered from Depression for many years and I've wanted to help her to recover but didn't want to exacerbate her situation by offering ill-founded or unwelcome advice.  In an effort to feel comfortable about directly addressing her situation I bought several books that purportedly would explain what it is like for her and what others have done to overcome or manage their condition.  None of the books I read really put it in a way that I could comprehend nor identify with, or what it must be like.
I feel like I've experienced a sudden epiphany or revelation in terms of my understanding of the illness.
I have just returned from a holiday in Europe/England and travelled economy class on a flight from London via Dubai which left England around 11pm.  We awoke at 7am so were awake for 16 hours before departure.  I had only a few hours sleep before arriving in Dubai.  The subsequent flight to Melbourne was disrupted and we had to return to Dubai so the entire trip took around 36 hours instead of the original 24 hours.  Except for a few hours of sleep I must have been awake for over 30, in addition to the 16 hours before departure.  Overall it was nearly 2 days without adequate rest.  As a result I experienced a severe case of jet-lag.  The symptoms included lethargy, irritability, confusion, fatigue, bouts of nausea and inability to relax enough to sleep properly at night, but uncontrollable sleepiness during the day.
I thought, 'if this is what Depression is like, no wonder people struggle to cope!""
I couldn't think straight.  I tried functioning during the day, e.g. I tried to order a new battery for my wife's laptop and couldn't even correctly transpose the part numbers into the online order form.  I mistakingly wrote an ""8"" where a ""B"" should have been,  an ""S"" became a ""5"" and I left a ""0"" out of a string of 3 zeros in a row.  No wonder the system couldn't find the correct model of battery!
This confused kind of behaviour continued for 3 or 4 days until I rested enough to be able to function somewhat normally, but at least I've now recovered.
I would appreciate a reply from anyone who is experiencing, or who has suffered Depression, to comment on my symptoms to see if they are similar to those of Depression.  If they are, I will be better able to understand my daughter's situation and why it's so hard to overcome.
With sleep, at least one can recover from temporary jet-lag!

there has to be a better place for me. Is depression when you hide from every one I will not leave my farm unless my wife is with me and then I am afraid some one will come near me. I f I see some one come near my gate I will hide behind a tree till they go.  I want to die but just cant bring my self to do it as I love my wife to much. I have been on tablets for depression for 3 years but there not working any more. I am scared they will lock me up and never let me out. I just wont to be left alone hope I  wont to go to sleep and never wake up again beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I an hyper sensitive. I wish so very much I wasn't.
I do not read papers or watch the news because all the pain in the world is too much. Even when I'm well I know that this isn't a world I like being in.
I go on facebook and animal lovers sometimes post tragic stories to highlight what goes on. Last night there were three. I try no to read them and usually I can somehow get by. I love animals and it may be wrong but I prefer them to people.
Well last night there was a story which has made me cry and cry. I won't repeat it here because I don't want to upset anyone. But it's made me just feel so miserable. My mood has come down anyway although it would have really upset me whatever. It highlights the absolute cruelty and I know this is common place. Ironically this had a happy ending but there was something in the whole situation that touched me in a profound way - if that makes sense.
I know that this mood will pass. What won't pass is the continual cruelty that people, animals and the environment are subjected to.
I tried to ring one or two people that could maybe calm me a bit but they weren't in. Then I rang the Samaritans to talk a little. The chap helped a little but I feel so miserable. I really HATE this world. I was like this before I was ill. I wish I could be like my son. He has excellent coping skills - somehow he can separate his emotions from the cruelty.
I have to go to the charity shop now. I posted this really to get it out because the hurting feels too big. I really hate this world.

hi,So...gah i dont know how to really start, I think i have found myself here at Beyond Blue because ultimately i feel alone with this.  I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression about 6 months ago, it was about 9 months ago that i first had a 'breakdown' of sorts and started seeing a psych and looking into medication.  I am finding it all very difficult...even as i right this now my anxiety is telling me to stop and delete it, shut the computer off because no one will want to listen to your petty complaints, plus your grammar is probably woeful!  i have a lot of time at the moment to myself (whether this is a good thing or not), i have one part time job and a supportive partner who i happy for me to take time to 'get well', not that he really understands what that means.  I am therefore alone for the majority of each day and that is how i like it. I am worried i am getting to dependent on this time and am now actively hiding from the world even more.  I suffer all the usual symptoms that comes from googling 'depression symptoms' but i cant get past how stupid i feel every day. I still dont believe i have depression i feel as though I must be making it up, i dont really have anything wrong with me, i'm just lazy and can't be bothered trying so i will pretend to be ill.  also i am having great difficulty with medication and was hoping for some advice from others...i was originally put on medication which went up pretty quickly after i realised that it was having little to no effect.  This made me very numb and ruined what was left of my sleeping patterns.  I felt as though i couldnt really be happy or sad, instead of being able to cry i would have mini panic attacks.  I had very bad withdrawal as i was changing to a new drug, i have started on a dose and am at least 21 days in, which is how long they tell you to test it for...i am not feeling like the side effects are going away. I am constantly fatigued, very sleepy, and almost everyday suffering one, more or all of the following; insomnia, nausea, headaches, dizziness, vertigo, constipation, diarrhoea, sweating, hot flushes, and heightened anxiety.any advice would be greatly welcomed. thanks so much.CC

Feeling absolutely terrible at the moment, I'm behind on paying my parents board because I've spent my money on food and drinks, money which I received from centerlink. They're working hard and all I do is spend money on stuff that I want because I feel too stressed to work a job. I feel like my life is going no where at the moment, I'm 23 and don't have a diploma or any qualifications. Attempted 2 different TAFE courses, 1 of them twice. All of which I dropped out of because I felt overwhelmed and stressed by.  I don't have a job and feel like I'll struggle to work one. I feel so stuck, despite trying to keep busy I feel like a direction-less spoilt brat who has been given everything and yet is still unhappy. I feel even worse though because I know feeling sorry for myself achieves nothing and I can't help feeling it. This makes me angry and frustrated at myself. I feel like I never learn, I never deal with this in a better way. I just sulk until things go my way because I feel powerless to actually do something about it.

I have always had in the back of my mind that when you get to the age of thirty your life pretty much ends. So, i guess i've got two years left….. 


I am struggling to effectively deal with growing older and find that i am experiencing a lot of anxiety and depression associated with the idea.


I will briefly touch on my background. I have just turned 28.  I would describe myself as having super sensitivity to life, which is slowly being dulled with time. One of times few positives. I am relatively introverted, socially anxious, characterised as OCD, imaginative, idealist, borderline dreamer, person who has probably lived too much time in his head instead of facing that sometimes painful 'real world'.  I have historically been someone that has tended to enjoy riding the emotional roller coaster and have dabbled in drugs to potentiate this fluctuation. 


Don't get me wrong. I am a real person, am slowly beginning to face some long running fears, engage in a lot of healthy behaviour and there are a lot of positives in my life .


I understand it is not a unique idea, and is probably in the back of everyones mind. It hasn't come into fruition overnight but the feeling (or lack of) has grown since my mid-twenties. 


I am pessimistic about the future as i feel it is going to be one general slide towards feeling less and less. I hate this emotional flat lining. Is this what ageing is……?? Where the moments of feeling truly alive become less and less. What sucks more is i feel that i am acutely aware (more than other people) of what i am loosing. I get fleeting glimpses of how i think i felt (experiencing feelings of higher intensity) when i was younger, and feel sad knowing that i can't get feelings of that same intensity back.


I have half a mind to neglect preparing for the future just so i can experience the next few years with more feeling. As in quit my job/career, travel, go hard on drugs and generally not give as much of a $#@%.


I hate sounding like a downer, but hey, i guess this is a depression forum. 


Any advice and or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Maybe from someone that's gone/going through a similar experience. I guess its not something that you can conquer but more come to peace with. If you do have a time machine though…. let me know, I'm ready!


I am listening to the song 'Human' by the artist Krewella on youtube , as i write this and well...... not all feeling is lost. 


Cheers guys/girls

I was 8 years old when I first thought of suicide. I'm now 20 and over the years these thoughts have gotten more frequent to now nearly every day. Some worse than others. I have a beautiful loving and caring girlfriend, family and friends. And yet I've been stuck in my head for years dealing with this stuff myself. I've tried reaching out to people but finding it makes them feel awkward which results in them trying to dodge where the conversation is going. I've spoken to my mum and bought her to tears. Dealing with this burden has become a burden. So I deal with it myself. I'm so tired of living life like this. Driving to work and feeling awful over nothing. I think about suicide. And it all sounds perfect until that one word comes into play. Selfish. What of my mother? What of my sister and father? What of my friends? And what of my girlfriend. A complete stranger who has come to love me and grown with me. How could I be so selfish to leave them all. All these beautiful people full of colour and love....but what about me...?theyre not spending their time dealing with these thoughts day in day out. I have little will to live. But I can't deal with the thought of hurting anyone other than myself. And so I guess I continue to block it out. Wear a fake smile and and cry silently , pretend to be happy as I have done for the past 12 years.

Still in Perth Clinic. I will be here till next saturday when my husband will fly down to Perth. Then we will have a few days in the city together as well as him having a chance to chat with my doctors then we will be flying home... bit nervous bout that...
I think the mood stabilizers are working and Ive found some of the things weve discussed & learnt in group to be quite relevant and helpful. I guess the real test will come when I go back to my usual life. Going to buy tge set of relaxation cds as Ive found that really good.

Hi, my name is Jezz and I have depression. Not that ""Black Dog"" as some describe it, I feel like it's my dark side, whispering loathing thoughts and clouding my mind from the real world.I feel stupid even writing this. I'm in my early forties, married, family, well-paid and I can't understand how I got here. I'm no good at my job, my boss hates me and my family think I'm a joke. I have self-sabotaged every good job I ever had, and my dark side helped prevent me from pursuing those things I once called dreams.I tried to kill myself when I was 13. My suicidal thoughts have been with me right through school, Army and now in the private sector. I have real trouble being able to relate to people - even my own family. They think I'm a joke and my kids don't have any respect or interest in me. I can't blame them. But they sure can blame me... and now my 10 year-old son has revealed to his teacher after much prodding that he wants to die.I have never spoken of my thoughts to him, but now he's feeling this way - has he picked these thoughts up from me?? My failure is now complete.If you've read this far - well done. I'm not sure what I'm doing here, but writing this out is bringing it all up and maybe it will help.Thanks for your time.

Every day I wish I would wake up in someone else's life, maybe someone not so screwed up as me, 
I'm tired of being me, I'm tired of fighting myself trying to prove that I didn't chose to be this way, no one in my. Life actually cares to understand what it is like to be me, I am always there for everyone else putting everyone before myself, recently tried putting myself first and to begin with it was nice, I had a back bone!! But sure a enough it's back fired and now I'm just there for everyone to call upon. 
I just want to wake up and not have to deal with everyone.... I can't express my feelings to my family I feel they judge and don't really take this seriously, it's just a phase.... They look at me like I do it for attention.... My friends don't understand, and my partner holds it against me constantly, he resents me for being me. And I hate it. I feel like a burden all the time I can't open up and be 100% honest about my own feelings because it somehow makes me a bad person, or I'm to I did it all to myself. 
Why  can't anyone just know!!! Why can't anyone close to me tell me it's ok not to be ok!!!! Why can't someone just hug me and let me be who I am!!!! I haven't always been sad! But I didn't do this  on purpose ! 
I want someone to understand and well someone to just listen and actually care.

Hi.  I am new to this forum.  I have had clinical depression for over 15 years and have had several relapses over that time, including post natal depression.  I have a great psychiatrist whom I can depend on and I respond well to my medication.Recently however, I have been feeling like I was starting to relapse again, due to stress.  I was starting to think of death, reading articles relating to death on the net and basically feeling quite morbid.  I was starting to feel disconnected from my family and life in general and I know that these things are my warning signs.  I have begun seeing my psychiatrist on a more regular basis and life is better.  When I suffer from depression, my parents were always my greatest support.  My father passed away in August 2010 and my mother 9 months later.  Although I suffered from grief at that time I did not relapse.  My husband doesn't really like to discuss my depression he just tells me to seek the help I need.  However, I have never told any of my closest friends that I suffer from a mental illness.  They think that I am very quirky and different and I think that a lot of people who suffer from a mental illness do see the world differently, in a very individual way.  And I am proud to be that way.  Some of my friends are very negative regarding mental illness and I am starting to feel isolated.  They know something isn't quite right but why can't I just come out and say that I suffer from depression.  When my parents died everybody was saying that I was so strong but I think my medication made me cope a lot better and it took a year for me to really start to grieve.  But the grief was different to depression. Do other people hide their illness from those closest to them? My friends are my support network for practically everything but the support I really need is when I am starting to feel like I am going to relapse.  If I had a physical illness people would offer me empathy, but sometimes I just want someone to ask ""how are you feeling"" or ""are you ok"". beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hey everyone,  I am currently in a rut.  I am struggling with sleeping. Last night I got to sleep at 6.30am tonight so far it's 3am, I am going to the doctor to see if I can get something to help me sleep.  I can't. Keep sleeping all day or forcing myself to stay awake when the alarm goes off. Please help

Hi everyone.  Just joined tonight.  Why?  Because I need to talk about my depression, which I think is getting worse. I've had a few reasons in the last few years to be sad. After years of motherhood my children have all left home now.  I think they call it ""Empty Nest Syndrome"".  Add to that, Menopause has come into full bloom....hot flushes are not for the weak.  My mother died 2 years ago now and then my mother-in-law died in hospital last November with me holding her hand.  God bless her.
 
I added up all these stress factors in my head and can see why I'm so sad.  I'm grieving I guess.  I have a kind husband who bravely listens to me..  I have no friends and unfriendly brothers and a sister. I have a part-time job that keeps some of my week occupied.  I don't love my job but I'm grateful to have employment at this time of my life. 
 
I've started exercising as I read it helps with depression.  It really helps but I'm very sensitive and I've never really been any good at anything in my life.  I'm not attractive and I haven't got a sparkly bubbly personality like some popular people do.  I largely get ignored or people just talk over the top of me if I'm telling a story.  I try not to wallow in my depression too much so I read books, listen to upbeat music and try to keep my days occupied.  
It's nice to have a forum where I can vent.  Thanks for reading this.  I'll write again soon.

It's late for me and I'm not sure if I'll be on to see replies.I've been debating whether or not I should even be here, but considering that things don't seem like they're getting better what choice do I have?I've tentatively done the self-diagnoses regarding depression, and I do know that there are several symptoms that are persisting.For starters, I've pretty much lost all desire to do the things I once enjoyed. I've spent the last few hours being unable to write or draw anything. In the past I loved it. For the past several months the interest has been waning. I remember what it was like to enjoy myself and this makes it worse for me knowing that I used to have fun.I have work tomorrow but I don't feel like it anymore. I have little desire to work and be a productive member of society, even though I know it's better than sitting around being a bludger. I can't make the effort to better myself.I feel heavy, fatigued. Sometimes achy. Easy to feel irritable and I get annoyed at small things. I have little to look forward to. Even sleeping feels meh because I know I have to get up the next day, and for what?A lot of the time I feel nothing is there. And when I do have feelings, the happiness is fleeting and my anger is somewhat... well, it involves self-harm. The pain I cause for myself somehow makes me angrier. And there's the negative self-talk. I rarely encourage myself or tell myself I'm awesome or whatever. WhenI get angry over stupid stuff I tell myself I'm worthless, stupid, pathetic, etc. That I'm not good enough, I'm always screwing things up and I shouldn't even bother trying to make it better because what's the point?I'm not suicidal. I haven't had a suicidal thought in ten years, not since I moved away from home. I had a really bad time back then with, well, it wasn't referred to as depression, but I had to take medication to help me cope. Until they made me stop feeling things and I quit them, and my GP left to go on maternity leave for several months and I hate HATE changing doctors. So I never went back and just dealt with it.Beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Sorry. I have severe depression and anhedonia, and anxiety. I'm currently undergoing ECT and an MAOI antidepressant for it (but the treatment's only been ongoing for less than a month, so improvements are negligible). I'm sorry. I really can't think. I made a list of things I've felt/thought that might seem strange to another person, even with clinical depression, then I trimmed it down a bit to just the things I just really can't rationalize..Sometimes, especially right after I mess up socially, I self-harm because I feel like an absolute worthless idiot who deserves to be hurt.I think, and am extremely uncomfortable with the idea that everyone just thinks I'm perfectly normal, and that I'm just a terrible, lazy, incredibly dull person. I'm always apologizing to sort-of communicate that this isn't a part of my personality, and that I really do hate how I am and how I think.I'm constantly internally (and sometimes whenI' m alone, externally) telling myself to shut up because I hate all my thoughts and can't stand listening to myself and how I think when I'm like this. I have a tendency to get disproportionately angry and stressed, to the point of violence and/or self-harm, for no real reason.I occasionally consider the possibility that my p-doc/s, and/or my family might be working towards making sure I never get better, like they might be spiking my food with something that causes severe depression, or they might be trying to prevent any chance I might have at remission/potentiation by maybe giving me placebos, or the food spiking, or something else. There've been times where I've put things on the inside of my door before I sleep, so I'll know if it's been opened, or discarded my food without anyone knowing, and even searched parts of my house for suspicious substances

It has been a while since I’ve been on here.  I have been struggling with things for a
while now.  Instead of getting better I
seem to be getting worse - I feel like I have hit rock bottom now and  I just don’t
know what to do anymore.  I know I need
help and I have tried a couple of times but so far nothing seems to work.  I am trying to deal with issues from my past
that have come up again for me.  It is so
much harder than I thought it would be. 
I feel like I am desperate to get it all out sometimes and feel like I am
going to explode keeping all these things inside. 
 
I have issues asking for or accepting help.  I had it drilled into me over many years that
asking for help or asking for it to stop/crying/getting upset etc just caused
more pain and punishment.  Now I have a
lot of difficulty asking for help with personal issues.  I have always been very independent and never
needed help.  Now I desperately need
someone to help/talk to but I can’t seem to make myself do it because I know
most people do not want to hear about these things and I feel awful putting
that on someone.
 
Rationally I know it is not helpful to not seek help
but I can’t seem to get past the feeling that it is wrong, I don’t deserve help
and shouldn't be dumping this on someone else. 
It just feels like everything is crashing down around me and I can’t
stop it.  I want to get back to normal, I’ve
tried so many things on my own but am just running out of energy and ideas
now.  Any suggestions would be
appreciated.

I never really know how to start these, but I find writing how I'm feeling on here generally helps. Diagnosed Anxiety, O.C.D and Depression, so I'm never really sure where to post, but I'll try here. I thought I was going so well with my recovery and but I'm having quite the set back the past few weeks. 
The anxiety... the constant niggling thoughts, the nausea, the over-analysing, the inability to sit still, the bad dreams (and that's when I can manage to sleep). The depression is eating away at me lately. Full of doubts, the crying, the feel that my chest is physically aching, not wanting to do anything, struggling to leave my bed, the feel that I just want to sleep. My O.C.D. is getting worse too.. Constant tapping, everything in fives, needing to check doors even though I already know they're fine, weird patterns that I have to complete with my fingers before I can sleep... and just when I thought I was doing so well and was considering dropping my medication with my psychiatrist.
The worst part? Usually with any set-backs, I know what's roughly caused it. But I have no idea this time, it just... came. And now I'm just so very tired.

I've recently been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder in that order. I wasn't too surprised especially with the trouble they've caused me my whole life. My anxiety began when I was only 12 and in middle school. It was hard for me to get out of bed and even go to school because of it and because I forced myself to go every day I started feeling depressed every day. Then came high school and I did what I thought I would never do in my life. I dropped out. Now years past and I'm a social mess. I just turned 20 last month but feel like a child with no experience at all. I haven't gotten my license or can even drive because of my anxiety. Every time I get behind the wheel I hyperventilate and start panicking feeling like I'm going to crash. I don't know if I will ever be able to drive in my life because of this, and no medication seems to help with it either. I never got my GED because I just suck at math in general. I took the test and passed the writing section but not the math or science so I just gave up. My self esteem fell even lower when I found out I couldn't pass. It hurts to think about it.. Then to top it off my younger cousins who I am proud of, but sad to know that they all received scholarships and off to college while I'm at home all day wasting my life away. I'm a short female, I look extremely young for my age, some people comment that I look no older than 14 which also makes me feel even more like crap, to know I won't ever be taken serious because of my appearance.  Right now I'm living with my fiancé who miraculously cares about someone like me. He takes care of me and I feel like I might need support for the rest of my life with how things are going for me right now. Medications don't help but make me feel tensed, and just emotionless. We even discussed getting married but what's the point? My family views me as an outcast, his family doesn't approve of me at all. I have no friends to invite and it's just horrible the way things have played out in my life. I did have a job for  7 whole months which is a record breaker for me, but then I quit because of my anxiety and depression overshadowing me again. I feel like I really need help or I won't ever be able to actually be happy without having to worry every day. Worrying I will never have a steady job and the income I need to survive without someone taking care of me. I'm just at loss and it's getting worse.

I have been depressed for a few years now, at the moment I am stuck in an apprenticeship I HATE because I cannot afford to quit, I am currently an apprentice chef and it is not fulfilling, can barely survive on the little pay I get, I want to do something in community services but with work do not have the time to do the course nor the financial means to actually enrol in or complete the course.  my mother (whom I am close to) is moving away on Monday, the time has came so quick :( I don't even know if I want to stay here or go with her. my mind is just so messed up at the moment I have no idea about anything and cant even think clearly as there are 20 million things going through my mind at once I don't know what one to think about first and end up overloaded and breaking down, I have tried seeing a councillor, only got through two sessions and stopped going as I did not like it, I don't know weather it was the person or the whole counselling thing I didn't like. my finances are in a complete mess as it is right now I have three separate court warnings from three separate debt collectors about four of my debts and cannot afford to pay anything on any of them, and somehow I do not own anything besides a $1000 car, I do not even own the bed I sleep on and I have over 15k in debts, it may not seem like much but they all of a sudden got out of control and I cant fix it, I have tried getting consolidation loans but my credit has been dragged through the mud I cant even get finance for a chuppa chup from a hock shop.......
I just have no idea what to do anymore and don't know how to deal with things

I wonder if others have this problem.
I'm constantly analysing my depression. eg. I'm sure I should be having another good day - I know I was having them more often a few weeks ago; I feel like crying all the time - that's been for days now - I don't think that's happened since January; I didn't feel any pleasure doing/talking to etc why? Is my mood going down further?  The doctor seemed surprised when I said I was no better; God what will I do if I go down further - I'm on the highest dose of my meds  etc etc
This is a running commentary in my head on many, many days. Fear of not recovering or worse still, fear of getting worse. 
Possibly, and please tell me if anyone thinks this, my mood feels lower because of my expectations and the sheer frustration of not getting better.
Thanks,Helen

Ok, so here goes, 
I recently moved to South Australia from QLD to be with my fiancé, I left my job, my unit, my family/friends, to be with him, in a country SA town, and I hate it here. 
There's hardly any jobs going around here, believe me, I have tried finding one. 
I just want to go back to QLD town where I came from, there's more jobs going there (around 770 on seek site alone) where here there's 47 on seek. 
I'm getting more and more depressed being here, so much so, I sleep half the day, I don't look after myself properly (eating/showering etc) I spend most of the time crying. And my fiancé sees that I'm getting depressed. I've lost 11kgs since end of January. 
I don't want to be without my fiancé, (we get married in Oct in QLD) I love him sooooo much, but I just can't stay here. I need my family/friends, my home town & to work full time, (i'll need to try to earn $ for a while before we have kids)
My fiancé has been here probably about 7 yrs, he's on a disability pension and is likely never to work. He is a home body, stays home most of the time, and his mum lives here. He has no friends here either. 
He isn't keen on moving to QLD, But I know I can't be here much longer. I'm trying to convince him, and I think he may be opening up to the idea, of moving to QLD, and me working fulltime and sending him back to SA for visits. As it'd be so much easier for us to do that, then the reverse of sending me back from here (if I was working fulltime) as he doesn't work.  
I know it'd be hard for him to move, but it just seems the most logical solution. 
He's waiting for his mum to come back from holiday so he can talk to her, (as he doesn't have friends to discuss this with) I know he's scared of moving, he told me so. 
I feel like I'm in limbo, I don't know whether he's going to commit to moving or not, and I'm worried that he's going to break up with me and we not get married. 
Arghhhh my stomach is in knots

So I was admitted to Perth Clinic yesterday which so far is going well.
The psychiatrist has taken me off the anti deppresant meds and put me on mood stabilizers as the cycling between the highs and the lows is an indicator that I may now have developed bipolar 2 rather than depression... will be interesting to see the affects over the next few days...
Hope everyone is having a good day

Since I was a little girl I have gone through long periods of depression.  My teachers had me see the school counselor but I wouldnt tell her anything because I didnt trust her. I used to try to tell my parents but they blew it off as dramatics and ignored it or laughed at me for it. Because of that I internalized it a lot during my childhood. Ive always had friends but if my own parents wouldnt believe me how could I possibly let some kids in? I started gaining weight and withdrawing from people. I started to self harm. I dont even remember when I started having thoughts about hurting myself. It just sort of was. By the time I was in highschool I was a completely different person. I had an emergency surgery that left me unable to ever have kids. I didnt have anyone to turn to and while my family thought id just been ok with it I was constantly reminded of what I lacked when I was at school or when our family had a new member. It became a big trigger for me and I didnt know how to cope. What could anyone understand?  None of them were failures the way I would always be. years passed and I found myself engaged. The man I loved and trusted hurt me in so many ways and I would let the abuse continue because I was desperate. It took him leaving before I even realized what id let go on for almost two years. I started going to parties and experimenting with drugs. Every day I had hundreds of thoughts about ending it all. I hoped that id down the right combination and all my pain and emptiness would just go away. I told myself that every day was a new hell. Then at one of the parties I was sexually abused when I wasnt able to do anything.  I still have nightmares and plead in my sleep. Its one of the reasons im afraid. Im afraid that all this will make me unable to connect with anyone. Ive been unable to have any relationship longer than 2 weeks since my fiance left and married the other woman. I cant sit with my friends without feeling like its forced. And I know they love me and I dont wanna lose them. But I cant tell my family any of whats happened or anything that im going through. Id just be an even bigger disappointment. And im afraid they'll just laugh at me again. There's nothing that bites more than your mom mocking your cry for help. I want a promising life and I want to get past this but its all locked up inside and my only outlet is the internet and my cats. I dont want this to bring me down but imbjust afraid to seek help.

I've been having episodes of depression for 12 years now. As the years have gone on it's become milder. This one started in January after a year's break. It's a roller coaster and not the way I usually experience my depressions. So please could someone tell me if this makes sense. Bad days, copeable days, days of fear, sometimes great days. All these moods come any time, lasting anything from a day to a week. Nearly always for no particular reason. The depression is no deeper and these moods are so random I don't know where I am.

The TV’s are there, the computer is there.  The clothes are there – we have to be here.  We have to.We have heaters to keep us warm in winter.Our bodies are all different – everyone is different.  Just look at your fingerprints to reveal that.Some of us like tea, some like coffee, some like water – some like spicy food – some enjoy jazz music, others enjoy western or heavy metal.With every choice in your life, you are creating a path – a path that you have to travel on.So I guess when you don’t want to exist, you just don’t make any decisions.  Therefore, does the path stop?   Or do you stop?    I think the path is always there – and maybe you are on a travelator, that moves you along.  Just while you sit with your head in your hands – but what are you contemplating?I don’t know.Neilps:   my DOG days are counting up - and you know, I somehow feel better for doing that - my stomach was just getting way out of control - I had to do something.  Maybe it's not drinking that is causing me to be so terribly down.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I think it's other things.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi, not sure how to start.  Ive finally decided to make a profile and post something after a couple of weeks of just reading.
I'm 19 and just finished my first semester at uni, working part time aswell. I thought that once exams were over i'd be able to relax but i cant. 
Im panicking about results becuase i didnt do aswell as i'd hoped and cant afford to pay to redo my papers aswell as work demanding i work more shifts and it feels like this pressure from every direction is just crushing me. 
I moved cities to start fresh at uni to escape these feelings but theyre only getting worse, ive had a really hard time making friends and ive fallen out of contact with those i had. I feel like ive backed myself into a corner and eventually im just going to break. Every time i come to a fork in the road it feels like i choose wrong, I cant talk to my family, they'll only worry and want me to come home. 
It feels like im just a facade (i think thats the term i want) im just one ball of stress and anxiety who keeps up appearances everywhere i go. I have a different personality for every situation and now that ive finally got some time to myself i dont know who i am anymore. I dont seem to enjoy anything, its like ive kept up these appearances for so long that im just no one anymore. Dont even know what to do with the time now that ive finally got some to spare. 
Think i just wanted to get some of that off my chest, seems like ive got no one to talk to but myself nowadays.

Hi everyone! I'm new to this forum, although I wish I'd signed up much much earlier! I was diagnosed about 6 years ago and I have been on the long road of recovery, and I've certainly had my ups and downs. Recently I've begun dating again, and I've found it quite strange with this monkey of 'mental illness' on my back. Recently I had one gentleman taken aback by it, saying he knew nothing about depression and was really apprehensive. He said that he had an aunty who suffered from psychosis, and that's all he could think about when I told him I had depression. He since has explained that he still wanted to get to know me and try to understand my lived experiences of my illness, but it's really made me super aware and anxious about telling potential partners about my depression. Like, when is the right time? How do I explain it? What do I do if they reject me because of it? And further from that, if a relationship develops, how will my illness impact the future? Will he understand? Will he blame me? I've even been wondering if I will be able to cope with the complexities of a relationship? I know I'm in danger of catastrophising here, but I would love to know other people's opinions and experiences of navigating this illness and dating and relationships! Thanks!

I know it is just a low phase and I will come out the other side, as I usually do, but I am so over it right now...not feeling too great physically which makes it worse, have been alternating between freezing cold & boiling hot all day... I wish I could just escape sometimes from myself and my life... I know its not the answer but it would be so damn easy and I think a relief to just be done... have another counselling session tomorrow and we have discussed this before, that I dont need to get too stressed about the low times as I know they will pass but still it is hard...just wanted to vent to someone who would understand, I dont have much of that in my world...

For the last few months I've been struggling to look even my own family in the eye. I am terrified of getting out of bed and cry myself to sleep almost every night at the sheer horror waiting for me the next day. I am unemployed and have been jobsearching for over a year when I found the reason I haven't gotten a job is because my father in law (first reference on my resume) has been telling the whole town not to hire me. I feel worthless, I want to make a difference in my life, I want to change. I have been trying to call about about getting a diploma done, but every time I start to dial a number into my phone I freeze up. I just want to know what to do, I'll do anything, I just want it all to be over whatever it takes

I have known for sometime that I have swings of depression... it is not the constant kind... there are weeks I am fine and then like a car crash, it just hits me out of no where and I feel like I can't do anything to get out of it...  When these swings happen, they can sometimes have a triggering event or like I said come out of nowhere. When I do have these episodes, I tend to have feelings of being trapped, anxiousness and sadness. I have this feeling like there is this heavy pain in my chest where the only way i can release it is bycutting it open.. I sometimes wish i could erase myself or sometimes even just die. The thing is I would never kill myself though but i do fantasise about getting seriously sick or just disappearing when I am at my worst.  So yes, I know I have a problem, but when I go to my fiancé and tell him (which is not easy) he dismisses it and does not take me seriously which makes me feel even worse. My fiancé is the best person in the world, caring, loving the best I could ask for and we tell each other everything. Which is why I was ok in sharing this with him... but the few times i did i got this reaction.I feel horrible when this happens, like a stab in the heart. And then I get angry and take it out in some other way. I am not sure what to do?beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hello people you know what I did I joined facebook for 11months I really really wanted to see what people think of the real me. So many people friended me even ones I didn't know . Wow how exciting mainly I found out they disliked me they knew about what I did and their perception of me was not what I thought it was. Really I am shy, not very loud, funny at times, emotional , passionate, caring , love helping others. Their perception tarty., big mouth, know all, loves herself  haha that's ok all my links were fake like top designer brands ect ect some of the sports , all those countries I have travelled too man ive only been to goldcoast ive never been to Europe with what money?????    Myself and my husband have basically just worked took quick trips down south pay our bills pay our mortgage we have no expectations on our son . I put there that I see him playing for a top international league team as if ??? haha he can do what he wants im not a parent that puts any pressure on . Now people these people are coming too me with all my quotes all my sayings think they know my business they don't. I hate facebook  I really hope this is all closed down one day it is absolutely ridiculous to post up family photos photos of children this is all asking for trouble really. Look I have 2 friends I can really trust and 1 brother who is bloody incredible in my heart that's it really I know hey I wrote I cant drink too. I can people I know how to stop im not an excessive drinker now all eyes were on my when I went out lastnight I drank 1 in front of my spys and then later had another 4 when they left Im one cool cat and one smart cookie . I need this research people for the book I will write titiled MY BATTLE WITH DEPRESSION  This disease has taught me to enjoy 1 day at a time and to enjoy the small things like a simple hello from a stranger or just waking up in the morning seeing the sunshine or just seeing my son laugh honestly I live in the real world in not a dreamer im not a celebrity im just a realist who drives her husband absolutely crazy at times haha

This is my story. Perhaps it will resonate with someone, helping them to realize that they are not alone. Perhaps someone will be able to shed some light on my situation, giving me a fresh perspective and hope.I am a 34 year old male who suffers from depression. I have been receiving treatment these last 4 years, although my depression goes back as far as I can remember. I suppose that the stigma of having a mental illness kept me from seeking treatment earlier in life. This ""stigma"" is still an issue for me, not because I judge other people; but because I judge myself. I was in a relationship with a woman whosuffered from extreme anxiety and depression, she later became my wife. Her anxiety attacks were frequent and debilitating. Almost every night she would have a panic attack and ask me to take her to the hospital. We both knew that it would generally recede before we ever reached the emergency unit, however going through this process seamed to help. Maybe it was simply the thought that someone cared and was going to take care of her that alleviated the anxiety, or perhaps it was simply a matter of enough time passing. I spent several years encouraging her to seek help and eventually she did. There was a marked improvement as far as the panic attacks were concerned although her depression never really left.  Towards the end of our marriage, we have been separated for three years now, my own depression seemed to increase. There were a number of factors that contributed to this; the suicide of a close friend, the terminal illness of a family member, my feeling that my wife and I were both withdrawing and drifting apart. I believe that what had helped to keep me focused and able to work and function was the notion that I needed to be strong for her sake. I know now that one cannot make someone happy, happiness is a personal journey, and something that needs to come from within. My own people pleasing behavior was never going to result in my own happiness either. It became apparent to me then that if I did not get some help that I would eventually kill myself. What price misery?   I am running out of characters so I had better come to some sort of point.The last few years have been a dizzying merry go round of medication and therapy, so far nothing seems to stick. I am currently undergoing a protracted period of extreme depression, over two months. In this period I have lost my apartment and my job, because I have not gone to work. Losing all hope.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I'm 62 and most of my life I have been caring for people. My 1st daughter was born with Cerebral Palsy and I cared for her at home for almost 30 years. I had 2 other daughters who are fine. I have been through a divorce which was my choice. My brother and only sibling passed away at 42 from a heart attack. I cared for my Dad who had lung cancer and was beside him in hospital when he passed. I then cared for my Mum who had Alzhiemers Disease until she passed. I also suffer from Fibromyalgia and in constant pain. In 2008 my daughter became very ill and was put on life support. After talking to doctors and specialists my ex and myself were advised us to turn off the life support....she calmly passed away going on 5 years next month.I live near my 2 daughters who are both married; one has 3 children who are 17, 13 and eleven but because of her circumstances I haven't had a lot to do with my grandchildren. I feel I am a stranger to them.My youngest daughter is my rock and has just found out she is pregnant which I am over the moon about. It may seem strange to some but I am closer to this daughter than the other.  But I think sometimes she gets sick of me. I live by myself apart from my 2 dogs and 4 cats and have no friends; I say hello to the neighbours but I don't like socialising or going out. sometimes I can't even be bothered talking on the phone yet in saying this I feel so lonely and isolated. Does that make sense? Am I playing the victim? Am I feeling sorry for myself?I have been on several antidepressants over the years and currently have been on the only one that seems to work for 5-6 years now. I have seen a Psychiatrist after my daughter passed away and then a psychologist....that was about 4 years ago. Some days are good but mostly I feel I don't want to be here any more. I shouldn't feel this way especially with a new grand child on the way.I hope my story makes some sense because at the moment I'm feeling lost and sad.Beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I have battled depression for as long as I can remember. I have tried many antidepressants that have had no effect.2years ago ,out of desperation my girlfriend had me admitted to hospital.i saw a few physiatrists and the only real answer I got was more antidepressants.Last year I became worse,overwhelming negative thoughts,never a day that I'm not angry or depressed so I had a mental health team visit me.they have diagnosed me with dysthymia and have told me that my only solution is cognitive therapy and there is no magic pill.Ihave finally taken myself off antidepressants which was the hardest thing I've ever had too do.I have had lots of sessions with a phycoligist but I don't really see any improvement in my condition. I am at a point now where I had to quit my job as I just can't face the day and have lost my relationship as I'm just unbearable to be around..Is there any solution to this misery I call life

Hello, My name is A,I was officially diagnosed with depression 8 months or so ago. After almost half of a year in University, and countless days where I wondering what was wrong with my head, I finally decided to do something about it. I saw a psychiatrist, and I told him how I would spend full days in bed, not leaving for even a shower. I could barley eat, and I felt like with every beat my heart took, black tar was coming through my veins. I had spent nights curled up on my closet floor in agony and anxiety. I had self harmed countless times. I had written over and over again the dark thoughts racing through my mind.Naturally, medication was subscribed, and I was battling the depression, the worry, the new news of what was wrong all on my own.  Only a number of days after beginning my medication I had gotten so out of control that I felt I had no choice but toend my life because of the pain that seemed it would loom forever unless dealt with. I made an attempt one night, my roommate had come in without me even noticing. I spent that entire night in a hospital, completely alone, without sleeping a wink. After that things all went uphill. It was my lowest point. My parents were contacted by my roommate of my condition. They were finally able to support me. I was put on proper medication, and things took a while, but I began feeling like myself again. Days still came along however that I could feel the depression slowly creep up again and try to get a hold of me. I felt like I was swimming in pool, and I could stand up most of the time, but then some days the sun would hide, the clouds would come and it would pour. I'd start to drown. Sometimes this would last a number of days and I feel like I can't catch a breath. It's been 8 months that i've been properly medicated. 8 months that I've did everything I was supposed to. The thing is, Depression is still there, hidden under pharmaceuticals. It's dormant most days but I can't shake it. My question is when will the time come in my life that I can finally be free of this demon once and for all? When will I be able to breath, all day every day. When can I stop relying on pills to be happy. When can I be happy for real? On my own. Will I ever be able to get rid of this horrible part of myself? Will I ever be able to forget what happened that one night. beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Am 70.  When I was 20, I saw a psychiatrist at the university health service because of extreme shyness, particularly with girls.  He was so awful I never went back after the first time.  I had an academic career, successful, publications, awards, etc., but feel a failure.  I could be entertaining, spontaneous, informative, etc. talking to a hundred people, but in an ordinary social situation where I am not a lecturer, I freeze, can't talk, or when I do, it comes out so awkwardly that it falls flat.  It is as though I were two different people.  I only identify with the loser ""me"", not the successful ""me"".  I was good looking as a young man, looks never a problem.  Spent 3+ years with a psychiatrist in the 1990s (dysthymia was his diagnosis), learned a lot about why I react in certain ways, but could not change and ended up feeling even more of a failure.  I have almost no friends, avoid social situations whenever possible.  Am married with 4 adult children (great relationship with children), but no help.  No time to talk about marriage/sex, but also a problem all my life.   I have little faith in therapy, but I would like not to feel so lonely and useless (not suicidal, though).  I have notes the psychiatrist gave me, but they just confirm my inability to modify my behaviour patterns.  For example, I realize, as he said, that my self-image is largely the result of my conditioning by my mother, but it still seems, or rather feels like the ""real me"", even though I know that is its origin, so I still behave the same way.    I have read about CBT, but from what I read, it seems to me that you have to tell your self lies, deny what you know, or at least feel, to be true, and I couldn't do that.  I don't really have a good question, except that I would like to know if anyone knows if it is possible to find some kind of ""cure"" at my age, so that what time I have left (am fit and healthy, attend a gym) is not as miserable as these 70 years have been.

So I went and saw my GP today, I've been given a script for 2 drugs; one to help calm and settle me down when I need it and an antidepressant I start tomorrow morning. Unfortunately he did not complete a mental health assessment, so I did seek out a psychologist via my work eap program. Talking to someone face to face was an relief and a burden off my shoulders. I can only do what I can do. I need to focus one the future and getting better for my family. I will see the GP again next monday and will ask to complete the mental health assessment.

I can't speak for everyone here  but my experience of depression and anxiety is that, well, it's pretty awful. One the top 5 least favourite things in my life, somewhere between Justin Bieber and cold showers, both of which make my nipples invert in unpleasantness. 
 
I'm sorry everyone, I don't mean to undermine the severity and the effect of depression, nor shun those who enjoy Justin Bieber or cold showers, they're just not my thing. A weird (or possibly just stoopid) sense of humour is the one thing I hold close to me  and try to never lose because it keeps me fighting back and allows me to look at things from another, less painful point of view. I just think that we all deserve to be able to laugh at the things that hurt us, that is our right. Sometimes the joke is only for your own sake and no one else's. That's okay. I don't think laughing at something or joking about an issue indicates that you don't take that issue seriously or that you're weak in any way. It's a way of holding some power. 
But for those of you who can't laugh at their issues right now that's okay too. There's no pressure. There are some things in life people often don't take seriously enough and could do with a bit of emotion. If you don't really feel like you care try not to feel guilty either. These things can play on your mind - someone out there has it worse than me and therefore my feelings or lack of feelings are unjustified and a waste of space. That's part of what people never told me about depression. It can make hit you on a small scale but be so persistent that it you doubt it's there and question whether you're making it up to justify your own apathy. That can just be another part. 
Depression really comes in all sorts of ways, it can be a numbness, a prolonged feeling like there's no purpose, direction or reason for your existence, it can be intense sadness experienced in frequent bursts and it can be a consistently average /low mood. But it's really not always so obvious that what you're feeling is depression and/or just a part of your personality. 
I know right; hats off to captain obvious but these are things I often  forget and they can lead me to doubt myself. I say this hoping someone out there might not feel so alone and just for a bit of venting/musing. 
Whoever is out the reading this, I give you my love and wish you the best. I'll be posting  here somewhat regularly, to share my thoughts, learn from others and hopefully help as many as I can on here.

I'm 32. I don't feel like I have anything to live for. My life is a waste. I have no purpose or great talents. And every day everything just seems hard.I' m done. It's like I've felt every possible emotion that I'm ever going to feel, I've travelled lots, I've been in love, I've had a good career and now... I'm just done. I don't want to get out of bed most mornings, even on weekends. I've always been a loner and I'm okay with that. I have only a few close friends and only one best friend who really understands me. I've never been close to my family. I see my brother and his family once a year at Christmas. I visit my parents maybe 4 times a year. We just don't have anything in common and it seems like a pointless exercise to even try to build a relationship there. And they don't want to either. I don't trust people. I don't really like people that much. Meeting new people and making small talk is a huge effort.I'm a negative, pessimistic person. I have read a lot of self help books, tried affirmations, self esteem courses, gratitude diaries etc. None of it works. I feel bleak about the future. I don't see what I have to look forward to except more of the same struggle. I feel like I am failing at life. I don't like myself - the way i feel and the way i can't dig myself out of this hole makes me feel like more of a loser. Intellectually, I know I need to think positive and maybe I should be working harder on this, but it's just another thing I'm obviously not that good at.My job bores me. I'm a well paid marketing manager. Things are changing at work and I often feel undermined and like I have to fight for my position. I have talked to my boss but he doesn't seem to get it. I feel like I can't quit or change careers because I need the money. How can you start a new career at the age of 32 anyway? Working in the corporate world is just all so fake. People would think I am nuts to quit. The thought of working in an office job for the next 30 years is just ridiculous. Is this what the point of life is? I've never really struggled to find dates or boyfriends. I have been seeing someone who i believe is m soulmate (what he believe is another story - and it's a long one) on and off for 10 years and when I finally told him how I really felt about life I don't think he could handle it and we haven't seen each other for weeks now.

Ive always felt like I was a resilient person, shy and introverted but quite capable of coping with whatever life throws at me. Sometimes its dealt some very hard times but I have always picked myself up and carried on. I look back on things, and I have had to deal with a lot of stressors over the years and have had periods of low mood. For example, raising 2 kids entirely on my own, getting a degree while working, then caring for others in my chosen profession. But I have always managed to lift myself out of the depression with a bit of counselling and looking after myself. Last year, I completely broke down and felt suicidal. A number of stressors completely overwhelmed me and I could barely function. I have to work, so it took everything that I had just to get through the workday. I did start to get better with some meds, counselling, hypnotherapy and had been fairly stable for the past 3 months. The last 3 weeks have seen a number of different stressful situations,  and I am back to feeling hopeless, no energy, shake when I am in a situation with even a little tiny amount of stress, socially isolated....if I could escape to a hut in the bush where no one could find me I would be happy! Does this ever end? Will I ever get back my ability to cope with stress?

Hey everyone
I really don't know what's going on.  The last week I have been doing okay, keeping busy, housework, gardening, walking, coffee with hubby down the street, sessions at the hospital - things look like they're okay.  But then I think okay if I am doing okay why aren't I much happier in my life.  And how happy should I be? 
So why do I feel so sad.  I read a lot of people's issues on here and I feel really down.  I wish there was something that I could do more for these friends.  Reading about how much they are suffering, it makes me really sad. And I know we shouldn't take in others issues but it's too hard because I can relate to a lot of the posts on here.
I then thought before - so how long will my depression stay with me - will it stay with me forever and I will have good days and bad days. I guess the more work I do as in therapy the more I will feel better.
Jo

Hi everyone, just after some advice. I have suffered from major depression, ptsd and also anxiety. For the past 10 years I have built myself up to be able to cope with everyday life without living in the pit of dispair that many live with day to day.Over the last few months I have been slowly sliding into a huge depression of which I haven't been in in a very long time. I have started drinking a lot to mask the inner pain I am going through.  I also am finding myself doing things extremely out of character. I have spent the past few days on benzodiazepines trying to stop my mind racing. Does anyone have any tips to help get back to the person I built?

i don't want to be living like this but i feel so trapped. i've suffered depression and anxiety in varying degrees since i was a teenager living in england with mum and her (now ex)husband. i went to a bit of counseling at the time until i wasn't allowed to and eventually moved back to australia when i was older. recently i've had sessions with the MHP, but between only 10 a year and having difficulty in opening up to people, i feel it is beneficial but barely functions as a bandaid. over the last few years my partner has been struggling with his own problems and things have become very hard when he doesn't want to do anything at all and i'm either too scared to try or too fed up and frustrated to bother. i'm really struggling at this second now, and i don't really even know why i'm writing this or what i want just gonna stop now sorry

Like heaps of other people I have depression.  I have had very good help for at least six months and I thought I was managing my life.  Suddenly I feel as though I am back to square one.  Difficult to get out of bed, although I make myself do so.  A permanent, or so it seems, ache in my chest, feeling totally alone and sad unmotivated to do anything without a huge effort.  There is no reason for this.  I have family who care about me and friends.  I have places to go, people to see and things to do and yet I feel unwanted and unloved.  How does this happen and how do I get out of this situation?

my first ever post on this site and Id just like to say THIS CONDITION REALLY SUCKS!!!
I am 35 years old and have ""nothing to be depressed about"". some days I feel quite good then others I just feel crap again... having my first session with a new counsellor this week so hoping that will help a bit but I really dont even know what Im going to say... having my sessions via video link as I live in remote WA. have spoken to her once on the phone and somehow managed to give the impression that my husband and work colleagues are quite supportive of me but in reality they are just sick of me, they want me to get over it... I take my meds as required and make a point of getting some light exercise each day as these things are supposed to help. mostly I eat healthy as 18 months ago i had gastric sleeve surgery to help lose weight so getting the correct nutrition is especially important..
I know I am not as hard done by as many and I know that I basically have a good life but that logical thinking goes out the window when I am feeling so overwhelmingly low...

Hi all
Just thought I'd share a bit of my story.  I'm a 47 year old guy with what most would consider a moderately ""successful"" life so far - married to a wonderful woman, three great kids, a solid career.  But there's really been no enjoyment of life for as long as I can remember.  It's not that I'm sad all the time - on the contrary, most of the time I feel nothing at all and find myself acting out feelings for the benefit of those around me.  I know how to make the right faces and say the right things in social situations so that interpersonal interactions go well but really there's not much happening behind the face at an emotional level. I've struggled with anger most of my life but over the last four years have recognised where it comes from (people - especially my kids - thwarting my efforts to control situations) and have learnt to let go of the need to control... thanks to some excellent counsel from our church's pastor.
 All my life I've felt like an outsider - like everyone else knows some shared secret that nobody has ever told me, so I'm somehow left out. I don't mean that like it's some sort of conspiracy, it's more like when someone tells a joke that everyone else gets and laughs at, but you're missing some key piece of information to be able to get why it's funny. You might laugh along with everyone else, but you really don't get it. There's a shared understanding that you're missing and you don't even know what it is.
I've been unable to really form fulfilling relationships with people. In talking to my wife since my diagnosis she often feels ""shut out"" of my life, which is awful, but I was unaware and even now I'm not sure what to do except to keep sharing my journey.
The weird thing is that I was completely unaware that I was depressed. No clue. I thought this was normal, that going through the motions every day was as good as it gets; happiness and pleasure were for other people, and I just got to do my duties. I'd still be thinking that if it weren't for the fact that I'm studying at the moment and had a lecture 2 weeks ago on mood disorders. When the depression slide came up on the screen I was utterly horrified to find that it was me. A light went on! This is not normal! If this is an illness maybe it can be cured, like they say.
So I made an appointment with a good GP (she rated my depression as 16 out of 13! Who knew?!). She started me on meds and referred me to a psychologist for CBT. Looking forward to brighter days ahead.

I think hubby might b annoyed with me... I have not tried to stop him from going at all, in fact I have encouraged him to go which im pretty sure he will but I still feel like Im letting him down... I did no study or housework today even though I was supposed to do both... I know it appears to him that I am just being lazy but at the moment it is all just too much effort... I only got dressed today cos I wanted junk food so I needed to go to the shop, otherwise I wouldve stayed in my pjs all day... even now i am in my bed with my laptop even tho it is only 6:30pm... I know I probably should make the effort.....

Hi all, i am new to this forum but am feeling tonight like I really needed to get some answers or some insight as to how I have been feeling.... I dont know if its depression... or not.. or anxiety... or not...I guess I have a bit if a long story but... I just feel empty all the time, I feel like i am not good at anything I attempt and then I feel like a failure when I think i should try something else to see if I am better at that ( I am talking about my job here) I am 27 and have pretty much started a new job every 1.5 to 2 years changing careers or changing companies, It seems like when the pressure gets too much I look for something else. I am not a lazy worker by any means i am more of a perfectionist if anything and i put alot of pressure on myself... i always have in everything i do. I am currently working for a man whos way of working involves putting alot of pressure on me and expects overtime to be worked to pretty much keep your job (its very wrong I know) he likes to pick at things and put you on the spot, i feel nervous as soon as I hear him walk in the door and feel giddy in the head sometimes at work when I know he is there and my heart races. ..... I feel the answer is to get another job but then i feel like a failure, like i am giving up when the times get tough once again.... I have a partner who I have been with for 8 years. He says he supports me and wants me to get another job but then tonight when I was discussing how I was feeling down because I have to go to work tomorrow he snapped at me and said it was so annoying talking about this all the time, that all I talk about is my boss and that I should be positive. My partner works away and I dont see him for 4 weeks at a time so we only talk on the phone... as soon as the conversation was over i burst into tears and cried for about 30mins... I just feel really unsupported i think. 
.... i lost my mum 5 years ago to breast cancer and I dont have her to speak to about alot of things i guess which makes venting harder.. my partner cops alot of my down times.... on top of all the work stress I am constantly thinking i am going to get breast cancer and cant get it out of my head. 
I dont have feelings of suicide or anything but I just feel like... I am .... useless... worthless... and now... annoying. I feel like ok, I cant talk to my partner about feeling down anymore because its annoying him... i dont know what else I have to talk about..... I dont know what makes me happy besides my dog... I know I have family and friends but its hard to see past the things that get me down most of the time. 
As I mentioned earlier  my partner works away and you would think I would jump all over him the second I see him but I have lost interest in being intimate and am tired most of the time... I spent most of my long weekend lying on the lounge in and out of naps.... 
I dont know maybe I am just in a rut.... but I just wanted to see if anyone else can relate to this or if I am just being dramatic. 
I am feeling a little lost now I dont feel I can talk to my partner... Sorry for this very LONG post but i needed to get this out. 
Hope someone can help!

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 4 months ago, although I should've probably been diagnosed 15 years ago (I'm 30, so half my life). It was a relief to know that there was something wrong with me, and that it wasn't just that I couldn't cope with life while everyone else could. 
 
Four months of therapy and medication, and I'm just as bad as ever. I've tried changing my diet, and exercising as well, but everything seems to be in vain.
 
I thought once I had a diagnoses, my friends would try to be a little more patient with me. But it's been the opposite. One of them said that if I was on a downward spiral, that I shouldn't take them down with me. This was said in a group, and no-one stepped in. It was like they all just agreed.
It was a complete contrast to a few years ago, when one of our friends found out they had a physical illness. Everyone said they'd do whatever they could for him. But with me, since it's ""just all in my head"" - it's like it doesn't count.
 
I feel so alone. I live alone, I go to work (where I barely speak to anyone), I come home and go straight to bed. I just want to shut everything out and sleep.
 
I've never been this unconfident, unsure of myself. I'm at that age where most of my social circle are getting married, having kids, doing well in their careers, getting promoted, going on amazing adventures. And I feel like I've just let life pass me by, being miserable and cooped up, too afraid of doing something wrong.
 
I'm terrible in social situations but when I do speak to people, I trip over my words, forget common words, etc. Then in my head I go over and over and OVER what I did wrong and just want to avoid dealing with people at all.
 
I don't like my job, so I tried to change careers into something else, but I've been told I'm terrible at it. I'm too afraid to try anything new because with most things, I do ok as a beginner, but when you get to the point where you should be starting to go up the learning curve, I drop back and flatline.
 
I'm getting nowhere with therapy, and the meds aren't working.
 
I'm tired, exhausted, and worried this will be my future until the end. Everyone around me seems to have such optimism and energy, I want that. I want to have a smile on my face, and wake up and actually want to get out of bed. I'm tired of crying on my drive home from work, and waking up with puffy eyes from crying all night. I'm upset that I've wasted most of my life not really living :(

So here's a weird thing. For years I have actually WANTED to be diagnosed with depression. I have no idea why. It's not because I wanted to understand what was going on (partially yes), I think it's because I've always wanted to feel special in some way and not be like everyone else. So when I went to the doctor and she actually took me seriously I was a bit surprised but relieved. But then I've started looking online at stuff about bi-polar because it sounds much sexier than boring old depression. I also have deliberately not told (many) other people, but have secretly hoped they find out by accident and that this will somehow make what is going on far more serious/significant. Why the hell am I thinking like this? Is there something else wrong with me (you know I'm hoping everyone will say yes don't you... LOL).  Anyway, would be interested to know if anyone else had thoughts like this. I really need to see a psychologist soon.... only a week away.

so a bit of background (short I promise!). Just prior to being diagnosed with depression about 7 weeks ago I felt like the whole world was hurting me. Everyone and everything. I was hiding in my closet because that was the place I could go where only my own thoughts were hurting me. It was so painful just to be me that all I could deal with was me. I was having a lot of issues with my partner because it felt like everything he was doing was mean and hurtful when in reality I was so delicate that anything was hurting me.
After starting to take AD's this improved vastly, and for 5 weeks it went well, with one change in medication in there. 2 weeks ago I changed to a 3rd to try to alleviate some side effects. This last week has been a gradual slide back to where I was. But the thing is I didn't realise it until I was way down low again. It is making it hard to trust my own thoughts and reactions as I don't know if what I feel is real hurt or if it is magnified hurt. Does this make any sense?
I am so lucky to have an amazingly supportive partner. But I am finding it hard at the moment, he asks how my head is and I honestly don't feel like I even know. I am questioning myself constantly. Dr has increased my dose of the 3rd AD to see if it was just the dose was too low, she tried an initial small dose to see if it would lesson side effects and I am on day 3 of increased dose.
How do I ever trust how I feel?

37 year old female here who just started on AD's about 7 weeks ago (onto my 3rd different one as there have been some side effect issues).
My question to people is in regard to telling people about your depression, close family, friends etc. I've told my mum, only because I was upset when my Dr suggested I take AD's and needed my mummy :) I haven't told either of my sisters, but we're very close and I feel like I am hiding something from them, we talk every week and it's a big change in my life that I haven't discussed with them. But I just can't think how to tell them.
I've always played my part very well, my family don't live close and over the years I have worked out how to get around their questions of how I am by talking about work and changing the subject, or brushing the questions off, so they really have no idea. It would be a huge shock to them.

Hi, this is my first post.
Iv been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past 10+ years, i have been on many different medications, visited many hospitals and mental health clinics but I'm still fighting a losing battle with the dreaded black dog!
I had a treatment of ECT last year which helped short term but Im now back in the same dark place that i call my life.
All of my depression is related to money (or the lack of) and this compounding with my depression is causing a very unhappy relationship with my wife and daughter even though they are very supportive.
Every day at work is a massive struggle but I know I have to be there as we are on the verge of selling our house or becoming bankrupt. With this stress upon my shoulders I feel a tremendous amount of guilt that exaggerates my feeling of anxiety and depression.
I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and I'm afraid that I will be admitted to hospital again for more ECT which means 2 weeks off work (unpaid) and this will be the beginning of selling our home!

Hi, I've just discovered the forum aspect to beyond blue and thought I'd try be brave enough to get the advice I'm so desperately craving. I'm not sure how to write what I'm feeling but I'm going to give it a shot. Basically, I am terrified. So much has happened in the last few months and I'm struggling to make sense of it. It's all so overwhelming. Just before Christmas, I was confronted by a work colleague about my apparent change in behaviour. I insisted I was fine but a few days later was approached again. Since then, it has been a whirlwind of chaos. Anyway, earlier this year, my employer made me see a psychologist. That in itself was difficult. I refused to go back. I've been finding things getting harder and harder. I can't concentrate at work. I can't sleep. I wake up every hour. I'msad, all of the time. This has been going on for about 6 months but the last month has been the hardest. I spoke to the colleague  again and found myself back at the psychologist. She now wants me to see a psychiatrist. I am literally terrified.  I have never dealt with anything.  I also grew up with a drug addicted sister, abusive brother,  and alcoholic/absent father.  I was abused as a child. I am drinking a lot. I am having thoughts about how easy it would be to just end everything. I don't want to. But I can't escape the thoughts. I am so scared. I'm completely numb to everything. Apart from the occasional tears. I catch myself thinking about how easy it would be to just, let go. To leave. Tonight has been hard. I've been anxious and scared. Sad and jumpy at the slightest noises. Please, someone tell me it will be ok. The only person I trust is my work colleague and I have leant on her too much already.

I feel that all to familiar black heavy mist consuming my soul, my body, my thoughts, my moods. I can't fight it now, I'm tired. My thoughts sit in my fatigued head, my heart physically hurts. I open my mouth but all those words spewing out of me like I'm auto pilot are not me. 


Who am I anymore? 
Its been so long I can't remember who I was! 
Why does this dark pain never go to that place in my head that my heart, soul and me seems to be hiding. 


I have fought this for too long and I'm tired. I sit and think how I just want to get in my car and just disappear. I can't carry this pain anymore, I can't keep putting my family through me and my darkness. 


I want my children to not have a memory of their mum being this shell, I'm sure they look deep into my eyes and struggle to see my soul. But I smile and continue to be that strange person who looks at me in the mirror. 


How many more tears can fall silently from my eyes before I face what I know is the answer to all this pain becoming nothing more than a distant memory. 


My name is Esther, I have a husband that I feel everyday is drifting away from me, he is busy and constantly reminds me that he is so busy, too busy for me. The motions always move smoothly, he does support me. But I can't stand seeing his face again and again as he looks at me like I'm a wounded animal that he knows he can fix. I only show him parts of me now, and yet he does bit noticed that his wife is slowly dying inside. I can't remember the last time he gently held me and made me feel like no one else existed. 


My name is Esther , I have two children 8 and 15, I go through the motions but what use is a mum that can't get out of bed on her days off to be an active participant in their lives. This is the person they shall forever remember.


My name is Esther, I work but I go through the motions there.


My name is Esther and I was diagnosed 2 yrs ago with this soul destroying debilitating illness depression. I was going ok and have gone down in the last 6 months. My dark thoughts are becoming more regular, I find my self whispering that my uselessness would not be missed. 


I have not posted on here for some time.

Hi everyone,
I'll try to make this brief.  I was diagnosed with a depressed mood a bit over 12 months ago.  I was on medication for a short period and then went off as things were improving.
 
But it may have returned tonight.  I was at a the birthday party of closer family friend's daughter 5 year old daughter. Normally I would happily have a nice chat with the people around but even after 5 minutes seemingly listening to everyone talking about the holidays they had just come back from, were organising or the houses they were planning on buying.  I'm under quite a bit of financial stress at the moment so it really got to me.  But when people starting bringing out their presents and I knew mine was sitting back there that only cost me a couple of dollars I had to excuse myself when I started to tear up.  In the end I had to leave early because I didn't want people to notice the tears.
 
At this point I'm not adverse to going back to the doctor but I simply do not have time unless I miss work or study.  And where I am with those at the moment would have significant consequences if I took time off.
 
So any advice would be gratefully appreciated.

I was just wondering how do other people deal with the crushing feelings? Like, Why should I get out of bed? Why should I clean? Why should I leave the house? Why should I talk to other people?
I'm struggling to deal.....x

I don't want to do this anymore, I don't care anymore. I can't be bothered being me. I don't want to do anything, I can't do anything because everything makes me so anxious and its such an effort. Im hopeless and a useless mother and partner. I see no light at the end of the tunnel. Im only living on for those who I know love and care about me and I couldnt destroy them. Im selfish, I know. I just want to feel something other than this horrible feeling everyday. It's been too long and its all I know.

Do you think it's possible that depression, anxiety and mental health can effect your feelings for the people you love and care about? Can we drastically change the way we feel because our depression has changed? I'm interested in what people have to say on the subject.

Hi All,I do not know what my official diagnosis is but I suspect depression of some kind and maybe anxiety. I can get out of bed (just) but at the moment all I want to do is lay on the couch and watch TV. EVERYTHING seems to take a huge amount of effort. I used to love playing computer games but at the moment they seem to require far too much effort. I believe I've suffered from depression for most of my life with multiple depressive episodes, however this time, something that I previously used as distraction (uni studies) now became incredibly difficult. It's like my brain is just refusing to work. My memory is also becoming very bad and I'm even worse than usual at making decisions.Three weeks ago I decided I had had enough and this wasn't normal and talked to my GP, I started crying as soon as I sat down, she immediately gave me a prescription forantidepressants. The first week I had some scary side effects - waking up with a racing heart in particular but that has now reduced significantly and I'm now mostly getting muscle tics. I saw my GP today and she reckons I should be feeling better by now but everything else I've read says it is more likely 4-6 weeks before things improve. I took time off work last week because I'm casual and I feel bad being here and being paid for sitting around doing nothing. I have told my team leader what is going on because I'd rather he know then just think I'm being lazy. Thankfully he has been really supportive.Basically I believe what causes me to feel like this most of the time, especially now, is that I feel that I've wasted my life. I have had a number of people say to me that I should be doing more because I'm intelligent, and the frustrating thing is that I know I CAN do more with my life. I've had opportunities, new jobs, ideas etc on things I could do to improve my life but just can't be bothered pursuing them. Once upon a time even when I felt depressed I at least had the motivation to go after things that I thought would make life better. For example there's my dream job advertised recently but I can't even be bothered applying. I think maybe I've got to the point where I've given up. That if I chase these things, they will be just something else that I get bored of so why bother at all? I'm also not sure if chasing new things and ideas are necessarily helping or just temporarily making things better.So my questions are - did anyone else notice that in the past they were able to find distractions to make themselves feel better but then it was almost like all of a sudden their brain stopped working and couldn't even do simple things? I struggled just to put some words together to send a text message to my mother this morning. I don't feel suicidal, I mainly feel overwhelmed and have a severe lack of motivation.Also, is just under three weeks too early for medication to be working? I will definitely hang in there, just a bit uncertain about whether my GP has given me accurate information. I'm booked in for a psychologist on 5th June which is in a couple of weeks so hoping things will improve once I can talk to someone.Thanks for listening.

I am cancer the crab  
I watch the waves crash onto the sand, leaving in it's wake smashed and broken shells As the waves recede back into the depths, some shells also return, intact, to the depths to surface again,and again or if the tide is especially strong go further out to sea, but will invariably return as the pull is too strong.  
Most of Those left on the sand will crumble under the feet of people  unaware of their  turmoil - just another shell on the beach. nothing special , no point stopping.  Then maybe just maybe, someone sees something. a tiny flash of colour, an unusual shape and they stop. they look. they see .
 Then they reach down and pick it up turning it over slowly in their hands. They see the beauty that was and carefully putting in their pocket think, ""I'm going to see if I can clean this up, and return it to it's original beauty"".
I feel like one of these shells I see on the beach every day. My hope is someone will pick me up and restore me to my authentic self   
Not this 'shell' of what I should be, could be, need to be. I am so overwhelmed

I've always tried to hide my depression. It's been something I have become quite good at doing. My struggles have been dealt with in silence. While there are people in my life who know what I go through, I am very good at putting on the 'I'm ok' face and just going through the motions. However, the events of the last three days have lead me to realise that I can no longer do that. It is not only hurting me, but those around me. And as I feel as though the walls are closing in, I am less able to put on the brave face that has always masked my inner struggles.  around this time last year I was admitted to hospital for an act of self harm. While I admit that this happened, I don't like using that word. My actions were not done toend my life, in all honesty I'm terrified to die. I wanted the thoughts in my head to stop and I thought that this was my only option. As I think back, it was almost an out of body experience. Like someone else was doing it and I was just the vehicle. I got the help I needed. I was able to work through what had lead me to that situation. I truly felt ok.  this year so far has been good. I was enjoying work, planning an overseas holiday, actively participating in social activities, making new friends, seeing old friends, finding love. I could acknowledge what had happened and was able to talk about it. I still didn't want my depression to define me though. In the last 4 weeks I have been faced with challenges. Not knowing if I had a job, issues at work (not solely directed at me personally), my social activities were becoming less, my mum (my biggest support person) went overseas, the guy I fell for told me he no longer wanted to see me and my shifts were so erratic that I couldn't catch up on enough sleep. It all happened at once, everything that seemed fine was becoming harder and harder to deal with.  I took myself away and put up all the walls I had previously broken down. as I looked at myself in the mirror all I saw was a stranger staring back. I am completely disconnected from the person staring back. My abilities to have conversations are clouded and I often don't even know what I say. Talking to a friend I said 'I just want it to end'. I did. I meant it. But I didn't want my life to end, I wanted the thoughts to end. I can see now how my words can be heard to others. I don't blame them for what they did. While at work, in a corner and barely able to stop crying, I was approached by a colleague. He told me to get my bag and come with him. As I walked down the hall I could see the police standing there. My friend, in wanting to know my safety, had called them. I knew what was next, as I sat in the hospital I just wanted to go home. How embarrassing to be in this situation again. How do you explain to people that you didn't mean it the way it sounds? It's right there in black and white.  I sat in a room with two security guards watching me. I felt like a prisoner. The psychologist sat there asking me questions. As I answered I felt her tone was judgemental. As I sat there becoming more and more embarrassed, crying, she made me feel like it was my fault. 'Well clearly you need to get out more' she said. Don't you think I know that? She finally let me go home, after telling me I should know better, given this is my second admission.as I lay in bed the images of the night were there every time I closed my eyes. I wanted it to be a dream. After a few hours I had to get up. To move. And that brings me here. As much as I feel like I am alone in my struggles, I know I'm not. I'm not ready to talk to all my friends. But being able to unload here brings me at least some kind of peace. I don't want to do this alone anymore. I don't want to be a stranger to myself.  I need help..

OK, like it says in the title, I don’t know what’s real anymore. 
It all started four years ago when I was living alone and picking up the pieces after yet another failed relationship. I am in my mid forties and have no children. I had friends and a good job but my life still felt empty. Guilty, unlovable, alone in the world. I had started seeing a new therapist and during the second session, out of the blue when I was talking about my problems, she randomly asked me: Elizabeth, do you think you might have been sexually abused by your father? 
It was like I had been hit by lightning. I felt sick. I felt lightheaded, I couldn’t breath. Was this the reason I’d been in and out of psyches offices for the past 20 years, trying to fix endless mood swings, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, anger, rages?
My new therapist thought we were onto something because I responded like this. She started pushing me to remember as much as I could and so I did, later at home that evening. It flooded my mind, a vivid and horrible scene and one that I don’t really want to go into detail with here for reasons I will go into later.
So I rang my therapist the next day and told her all about it.  She suggested I write letters to both my parents to vent the rage and pain I felt about what I had remembered, and to say I didn’t want to see either of them ever again. She was the expert, and I was in shock, so I did what she told me.
How did they respond?  Well my mother was shocked, frighted.  I never heard anything from my dad. She sent me an angry letter saying I shouldn’t blame my problems on her. My therapist said that attitude was more proof that my father had abused me and that she knew all about it.
So that was the start of four years of being totally alone and cut off from my family. I believed my parents were toxic, and my memories of sexual abuse gave me good reason to cut them out of my life. I kept up going to therapy. Weekly, sometimes twice a week, but nothing seemed to make a difference. I was still depressed, still suicidal. I started to think I was wasting time and just wanted to get on with my life so I decided to stop going to the therapist.  This was about two months ago.
This is where it starts to get scary for me. I started to have my doubts towards the end of the therapy, but it has only started to get worse since stopping.  I am now almost convinced that I made up these memories of abuse and that it actually never happened. 
My life at the time I saw that original therapist was a mess. I had a shocking temper, relationships with men were a disaster, I would fly off the handle at any criticism, and no self esteem. I had problems at work getting on with people too.  When I think back, that simple question ‘do you think you might have been sexually abused’ seemed like the answer to all my problems.  For the last four years I was able to blame everything wrong with my life on being a victim and being abused and the sympathy would flow. But have I got better? No.
This is an awful realisation to come to and I don’t want to upset anyone who has really gone through such terrible abuse but this doesn’t make sense to me. How is it possible for me to forget something so awful for so many decades and then just have it pop up like that? I just don’t know if it’s true anymore, and if it isn’t what have I done to my family? Can I ever fix up this mess?

Hi friends  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,As   As usual I am humbled that you have responded ..Most times I post without really expecting a reply from anyone as my problems are insignificant in comparison to so many others. I log on mainly to check how all our friends are doing, and are comforted when I see Neil, Geoff, jo ,mares, GA, and so many others ( sorry didn't mean to leave out names) have reached out again.Then I feel guilty that I don't respond to enough people and just take ,take take.
.Is it just me but does depression make you selfish? It always seems to be about me. Currently I am feeling so overwhelmed and I can't see my doc for another 3 weeks because when he can see me I am working, and being in a new job I can't take time off  
.But damn it he should drop everything and make time for me shouldn't he ? I mean I'm sure I have paid for his last holiday with all my sessions - he owes me right? 
Ok starting to lose it. one of my major symptoms are catastrophising things. I know this but can't seem to help it. I feel like I'm drowning . I hold onto the float as long as I can, go about my day, my life, pretend all is ok but really I am white knuckling it I start to have panic attacks and anxiety becomes my second name.
I want to wake in the morning and not have my first thought, "" That's right I have depression"" I want to not take medications because the alternative is too awful to think about, and I want to be honest with people and say ,""no I'm not OK""
.Too much to ask? It must be because it doesn't change.
Be kind to yourself friends

I just took the depression/anxiety checklist and I rank 39 (high). I'm female, in my 30s and I have kids. I've had to deal with depression about 10 years ago when I had two miscarriages, it was so bad I wanted to die. I would self-harm and I ended up being hospitalized for over a week. All I could think of was how much hated myself and I was trying to find ways out of my suffering.
Since last September -- for the first time in years since becoming a stay-at-home-mom -- I was hired and had a great job but then I was laid off a few days before Christmas. My grandpa passed away in the meantime and I ended up returning on welfare with hardly enough money to get by. Now I struggle with dark thoughts of worthlessness, hopelessness that resemble the ones I had 10 years ago. It scares me but I don't want to mention it to anybody. I'm full of shame and disgust with myself, My drive and energy has disappeared, I struggle with everyday tasks and I often wonder if I'm just not strong enough to handle life's hardships.

Ok. I think I posted my first thread in the wrong place. I'll try and be brief. For 12 years I've been living with chronic depression. The very beginning was a living hell. Over the years my depression has come and gone and I've even had a years break. The patterns of my depressions have been varied. Usually I lurch between feeling absolutely fine to feeling depressed. This can go on for months, then suddenly the depression stays away. I am not bi polar  it's how it goes. The depressions have become milder and at the end of January I went into it again, for no reason. I have the odd good day. I take meds and have been told they work ( which  I believe). What goes on in my head?. My life was going really well. I do not overdo it and live my life in a way that best helps my health. If it's chemicals, what are they doing? Do I recover because my brain chemistry sorts itself out? I no longer do paid work owing to my health problems. I help in a charity shop 4 shifts a week. I go to a writing group. I see my kids and live with a good husband. When I'm well I live a contented life, then this comes back.Excuse my going on but what really gets me is I do all the things I'm meant to. I've altered my life and cannot do anything like I used to. What doesmy depression want? Blood? Thanks for reading. Any advice would be much appreciated. Debs

""...Don't talk of love./ But I've heard those words before; / It's sleeping in my memory./ I won' t disturb the slumber of feelings that have died./ If I never loved I never would have cried./ I'm a rock. I'm an island...""
You know normally I have new theme or problem when I post a new thread. I don't really have one for this, just the old one was getting too long and I felt the need to post. I felt the need to contact with someone. 
I just came back from second session with my new psych. We are working challenging thoughts. It makes sense but it will take time. I knew that from the beginning, just this week has been so wretched that everything seems a monumental task. I made muffins yesterday. I sang and danced in the kitchen to the tunes of Sweeney Todd. My friend who was also having a hard night is going to come over today. We were meant to make muffins but I don't know if we'll have time now.
On the way home from the psych I felt so bad I was just silently crying slowly as I was driving. It's a skill. I stopped off on the shops, sunglasses on and all in order to spend my last twenty for the week on skittles and childrens stickers. The shinier the better. In my hospital admission, a friend of mine in there (fellow patient) held a slumber party of sorts and we had colouring in books, pizza and I decorated my various gadgets with bright glittery puffy stickers.  I bought these to finish the job ad decorate the cbt file my psych gave me. I bought them because I thought it would make me happy, or least give me something to do. It makes me kind of sad though it reminds me of the hospital and how safe I felt. How I had hope when i lefft for all of two days before I crashed. 
I am unlikely to be able to see my psychiatrist to change meds this week. She is just too busy. I could see a doctor on duty but they don't know my entire history. It's too much effort for someone new. I did hear via psychologist though that I can stop taking the antidepressants that have been giving me migraines. I have been weaning off for this past week. It would have been nice to hear from her in person, or get on something different but I guess that will just have to wait two weeks. 
I'm not that important. I am just going to take my stickers, decorate my books and then go to bed. Seems thats all that is left.

Hi guys,
it is a beautiful day but all I see are clouds
I live in a lovely home, not far from the beach but I feel trapped
I have a new job that allows me to express myself  and yet I have no confidence
I have an understanding and caring husband - I don't know why he stays
I have two well adjusted happy children but I feel I am a bad mother
I am sick of being overweight and taking meds every day
I hate my doctor for making me face my demons, yet I thank God he is there to support me.
I don't want this type of life any more. I want my old life back when I was ignorant to my depressive issues. Yes ignorance is bliss.
I am not religious despite being brought up in a God fearing household ( ironic I know) but I am spiritual .I believe in a higher power. I believe in ying and yang and Karma.
What is my purpose. this can't be the reason I am here. I have wasted ten years of my life. I need answers.
Stressless

I tried anti depressants but I couldn't function at work.
I spent 3 months in rehab and was clean for a year. However, the alcohol cravings returned.
I only feel comfortable dealing with the work when drinking.
Does anyone have any insights into this issue.

My friends have become really concerned that I have depression.
I, in myself know something isn't right- however I have felt like this, for that long, that it feels to me that it is normal.
I will always put others happiness before my own.
I am not un happy- not really sure how to describe it really.
I am engaged, to the most supportive and loving man I have ever met.
We have been through so much together- health wise.
I am constantly tired, and feeling as if I have to force a smile.
my partner isn't the problem, things were numb far before he came along.
I work full time, and I look forward to going to work.
But once I come home, I'm down, tired and irritated.
I know I need to talk to someone, but how do I start the conversation? I think I'm scared- I know I'm scared.

Hi,In relationships, I am always angry. After another relationship breakdown almost half a year ago, and facing single life, I am back to feeling depressed and lonely. My family have rocky relations, parents and siblings have tenuous or strained relationships with one another. I have trouble talking to my friends. I get so down that getting out of bed in the morning is a task. It can take 25 minutes to get up from the table after eating breakfast. I have very low drive to do things. I exercise, I speak to people, but the in depth stuff worries me. Having to know things and communicate beyond small talk, getting close to a person. I have no idea about what's happening in the world because I have stopped paying attention. Sometimes I get so sad, and I cry. I feel better afterwards, but it never seems to last. In conversation I am negative and cynical, and it annoys people.I've begun to see a counsellor again and hopefully things will improve. My dream is to have a good job, to meet someone, and raise a strong and supportive family. As I get older it's the thing that I want the most. When I think about the likelihood of those things happening I get very sad. Anger is always a problem, jealousy, and a raft of other negative attitudes.I think a lot lately about suicide. The thought is like a practical thought on how to deal with a problem, like thinking about changing a light bulb that's difficult to reach. When I think like that, I can't move, but the thought just appears. To tell someone about depression invites the same answers: ""Everyone gets depressed sometimes"", ""Life isn't easy for anyone"". Try telling those people that it's not just a one-off, it's ongoing, it never stops and I hate it so much. They turn their backs.I really do wish it would all just stop. Every day is either dull or hard, it's always there in my mind and if it isn't then the high watermarks are clearly visible. At every chance I shut it out and retreat into my own head. Talking about it helps to shut things out, but conversations can't go on forever. At some point you have to face an empty room and your own thoughts.Beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

What's happening to me?I don't understand it. My wife loves me. I am starting up a new business that everyone that sees what I am doing say that I will kill it. But I constantly want to curl up in a ball and cry my eyes out. For most of this year my self doubt has always been nagging at my sub conscious. Everything that I am felling inside is a massive jumble that I can't understand. During a particularly stressful week at work about a month ago where the construction of my new business was derailed completely I started to think back to 2003 where I failed at an attempt at taking my own life. I found my self wishing for the first time in many years that I had've succeeded. My father died in September 2000 and being a young man I tried to drink away what I was feeling. It culminating wanting to end my life. I ended up seeing a clinical Psychologist and was prescribed antidepressants and was on them for 6 month whilst seeing the Psychologist. I put it don to unresolved grief issues and have been for the most part fine. I was getting the occasional dark periods where I was floored for a week or two but I just put that down to normal mood swings.   I have shut my self off from every one in my life. I have no friends that I talk to and I am completely estranged from my entire family. I haven't talked to my brother for nearly 5 years and now recently my sister has stopped talking to me to the point where she has blocked me on Facebook and is talking about me to my mother and brother. I am a replacement child and have been told that by my mother. My oldest brother was run over and killed before I was born and my mother didn't handle well and had me. During a particularly nasty argument we had she told me that I shouldn't have ever been born and I wouldn't have been if my brother hadn't been killed.  I feel the overwhelming sensation of guilt all the time. I went to the movies on ANZAC day and didn't enjoy myself. I felt guilty for trying to have fun. MY wife was away in Melbourne this week and told me that she was going out for dinner with old friends. I went out and got pizza and felt guilty for doing so.I feel guilty for writing this. I feel like I have let my wife down and don't deserve to have her.  I used to drink very heavily all the time and have resisted the urge to do so again so far but I found myself standing at the door of a bottle shop yesterday and barely stopped myself from buying a short term forget session. I am sick of this. If I am going to be like this for the rest of my life. I don't want to put my wife through that. She doesn't deserve that. But I can't stand the thought of doing something to make her sad. I hope this makes sense to some one as I can't make any sense to any of it. I feel like a failure at life, love and work. beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi,
I'm a new member, diagnosed with bipolar at 37, now 44 and have a great family, nice home etc, nothing much to complain about. My last bipolar depression was a few months ago and was very bad to the point I'm (now) consciously doing all I can to avoid another. I take meds, eat healthy, exercise, see my dr twice a year - all the right things. To cut a long story short I cannot find my passion and feel useless and unfulfilled. I only work 2 hours a week and want something more, some self satisfaction and enjoyment. I've tried so many things and never stick them out. I become bored. Now I sound like a miserable, whining child! Why cant I get my act together? I'm beginning to feel like a can't do anything and my confidence is waning. What's wrong with me? I been feeling like this for a decade and its now getting worse.

Sometimes I feel really down for about a week (and i mean down like in the bottom of something deep down) and then go back to being ""normal"" again for a week or so and during this week I am quite happy with no worries at all. I don't know whether or not what I am experiencing is depression or just mood-swings. How do I find out? It would be weird if I went to see a GP because my father is one and whenever I am ill I go to him but would never in my wildest dreams discuss something like this with him. If I went to another GP people would start asking questions and I don't want people to start asking questions because they may start looking at me funny. so until I know if what I have is or isn't depression I don't want to tell anyone I know about my problems. 
I tend to make things seem more significant than they actually are, therefore I feel that one of the main causes of what is making me feel so sad is not knowing why. every time reflect on the problems than could cause this I tend to become even more sad so I then try to ignore my problems. It's also very frustrating and confusing not knowing, it seems like I have some severe mental illness but I don't know whether or not I have just inflated and stressed myself over what could be an average dose of sadness. 
until I find out whether I am sad or depressed I think I'll become more and more sad so is there a simple way of knowing?? is there any way of knowing?? i have also taken some of the online depression quizzes but they're not very useful because the answers depend on which mood I am in. 
please help me because the doubt  is so hard and frustrating to have to handle.

I don't even know where to start or what I can share/can't share here....
I've always been like this. Except the depression has taken over more in the last few years. I grew up in Foster Care because my mother was in and out of hospital and physically abused me. To be honest I don't really remember it at all. Mental Illness runs throughout my family. My mother was diagnosed with Borderline Personality, my Grandfather with Bipolar. My Aunt has Bipolar as well while my sister and other relatives suffer from Depression. 
I spent my entire childhood being diagnosed with everything from ADHD to ODD, Depression and Anxiety.... medicated up to my eyeballs on pysch meds for kids that didn't work. Eventually I grew up and worked out how to best manage my emotions on my own. I settled down and had three children whom I love more than life itself. Really. If I didn't have them, there would be no point anymore.
In 2011 something snapped and I had a meltdown. I fell into a deep depression. My anxiety was through the roof. I was losing my mind. The doctor prescribed antidepressents and this brought on what I now realise to be a ""hypermanic"" episode. I was so happy I could burst, I couldn't sleep at all, I cleaned the walls with bleach at 2am....
After a few months of erratic behaviour I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and we struggled to get my moods under control. in August my mind had had enough and I lost any control. I made an attempt on my life without even putting any though into it. I was hospitalised and tried everything from mood stabilisers to antidepressents, benzos, anti convulsants and anti pyschotics. This was an 18 month struggle until I finally found medication that worked for me. I hated the way it made me feel. I felt no emotion or enjoyment in life. Each day rolled into another and ""just was"".
I no longer see a Psychiatrist or a Psychologist. Nor do I have a regular GP. I've been medication free for 10 weeks now. Gosh some days it's hard and I don't know how on Earth I will ever survive, but then I remember how much I didn't feel when I was medicated and I don't want to go back there. I'm not happy, but at least I can feel how unhappy I am and not just like an empty shell. I can feel anger and outrage. I can feel excitement again.
I'm not sure how I will keep going for the rest of my life, but all I know is I don't have a choice. My kids are my life and they need me and that's what I tell myself everyday.

howdy everyone,
i've been lurking around these boards for a couple of months now and i think it's done me some good. It's great to have an outlet for the type of thinking that we depressionados are so prone to, this site is a positive and valuable resource for me and i imagine for many of you other posters. i tend to read here far more than i contribute, i'm so interested in all your personal stories and the characters here. i commend you all for the tenacity to persist through difficult periods of life and for the bravery and selfless generosity you invest in sharing yourselves and building this online community.. kudos to you all *one man standing ovation*
here, as in RL, i'm disinclined to discuss my life or particular situation in chronology or detailed specifics as seems to be the accepted convention around BB, although i'll always answer a direct question honestly if asked, so feel free to if you are curious. What i'm most interested in at the moment is your feelings on your diagnoses..
i've been diagnosed with a couple of acronyms over the years, as have many of you. i should point out that i have the utmost repect for the medical profession (although slightly less for the medical industry) and hold the medical professionals that I have dealt with in high esteem. What puzzles me a bit is the ""D"" at the end of all of these acronyms; disorder.
In months of reading the stories here, and in my own life I've noticed that, by and large, people's emotional responses are entirely logical and completely justified. I recognise from your posts that many of us feel depressed or anxious or angry. But in the hundreds of posts I have read, there is not one of us, not a single one  whose sadness / anger/ confusion is not 100% completely justified. These feelings are the natural, uncontrollable response to the types of extraordinary stress from difficult life events that so many of you describe. So I'm curious, why is a normal, predictable and natural human emotional response to stress so often labelled as a ""disorder"" in the modern medical paradigm?
In addition, a 2007 ABS study showed that 45% of Australian adults self reported having battled with depression or other mental x""illness"" in their lives. The number of people who actually have is likely to be much, much larger as negative stigmatisation prevents many from considering the reality. The rates have also grown rapidly since 07. So in a world where more than half of all adults have actually experienced these issues, it would appear that mental illness is now the new order and stoic, emotionless coping all the time is the new disorder. Sounds about right to me.
I'm really interested to hear all your thoughts on this issue. . Discuss. (lol, sorry, no it's not an exam question)
Wishing everyone a peaceful Easter.

""Depression is a prison where you are both the suffering prisoner and the cruel jailer.""
~Dorothy Rowe

How am I today? Afraid and uncertain. 

I made good progress these past few days. I went shopping most days for this or that. I even did the dishes. TWICE. So why do I feel so bad. I was out doing things. Achieving things. This should make me feel better.  So why do I feel this crushing weight on my shoulders now? Why does the thought of next week fill me with dread?

I think I know the answer to that one. I have my first volunteer shift on Monday. Just three hours. Three hours I get to spend with cats, volunteering to help out at the cat shelter. Cats make me happy. It's only three hours. That should make me happy. 

But I'm not. I am afraid. So terribly terribly afraid. My monsters keep whispering to me about what could go wrong. They keep whispering about how I'll screw it up. Normally I have at least a little strength to fight it off, or at least shrug it off and let the social anxiety of missing this appointment carry me through those three hours. 

I look inside and all I find is emptiness. These past few days, I almost felt like a person again. Hell I can shorten that sentence. I almost FELT. Where did that person go? II saw her, glimpses of her in the edges of my vision. I can't even see her now, where did she go? 

It hurts too much to hope. Hope should be a big positive, glowing thing but in my mind it is but a flickering candle flame. I don't dare com out of the dark towards that light because I can't trust it. It might go  out any minute. I'll be left in the dark again, the dark I know so well. Worse, I'll be left in the dark with the memories of what that light was, what it could have been. 


I'm not sure why I am posting. I just felt all these thoughts, like a pressure inside my head. I had to let it out somewhere. It's chaos in my head at the moment, voices shouting over voices; faces appearing in the crowd only to disappear a split second later. I don't know if I'm making sense. I don't know....

I wanted to apologise for not posting much lately. I just can't hear over all the voices, to get one clear line of thought sometimes. And then there is the effort of coming on here and pushing all these keys to get it out. Then the waiting, the anxiety as I hope it gets posted. I hope someone sees. The fear that something will go wrong and it will disappear and I'll have to type the thing out again, which seems all too hard. 

So you see I am having trouble helping myself right now. I don't know how to help others. It' like offering a hand down to help someone up and over a cliff edge. I don't have the strength in my arms when the ground is crumbling beneath my own feet. If I only had a firm footing, I could help pull you up. I could do something good. I could do something.

Hi all, 

I am really confused, and I don't know what to do.... I feel like there is no one that I can turn to any more. The doctor that I was seeing was brilliant, but she went back to Ireland and I haven't been able to find another doctor who seems to understand. I don't really have any friends (it's seems if you stop using Facebook people stop talking to you altogether), and I have one friend who I used to see on a regular basis, but because I am in this deep hole that I can't seem to get out of,  she hasn't  even spoken to me in a few weeks. I am going overseas with this friend and another in a few weeks (trip was booked last August), but now I don't want to go. I feel like this massive cloud follows me and I just bring everyone down. 
I am so sick of being like this. It's been 2 years. I have thought about the unthinkable to the point of making sure that all of my financial affairs were in order, I've thought about just driving off somewhere and disappearing to somewhere where no one knows who I am and just cut all ties with home and work....
I don't know what to do. I have a good job (although extremely frustrating), and I have to put on an act at work that everything is fine. I spend every minute in my room, never leaving the house. I don't want to go to overseas now, I don't want to go to work, I don't want to leave my bed. I am sick of fighting and feeling this way, and it seems like no one understands. Even the friend I see doesn't understand, she just seems to think I will just snap out of it, and I wish I could, bit I just can't.
I really don't know what to do. I'm over this well and truly. I want my old self back but I think that person is now gone forever.

What’s it all for.   
Go to work to do aimless stuff.   
I work out at the gym – continual working out, but am I getting any bigger?  Doubt it.   
Injured my bicep in November and it’s still giving me grief.   
I’ve stopped one of the really enjoyable things in life (having beers at night) and this is giving me grief as well. I mean if it wasn’t for my fat stomach, there’d be no need to go off it.   
Feel tired so much – and I thought it was just in the morning, but now it’s getting to me during the arves as well now.   
Am a hopeless joke of a father to my son.  Thank goodness that our daughter is a ripper!  But then she's turned out that way largely to her Mum's influence.  But our son just frustrates the hell out of me and makes me so sad and mad.  He won't go to bed early - that's a source of aggravation.  I’ve stuffed up so badly. I doubt there’d be another household that would be like ours – where our son basically gets everything that he wants.  And grumbles a lot of the time too.  But that's just another balloon of my depression.
Want to just lie down in bed.
Also have a sore right glute/hamstring attachment;  and also sore lower back, due to me being a 'paper boy' every Tuesday evening.
But yeah, these are just some of my stressors at the moment - tears still won't come - but I find I'm getting mad and angry INSIDE me;  that it's all balling up into a tightness but it won't explode and if it did, I don't know in what form it would come out.
I feel like a sham as well - I post to others and reply and support, but all the time I'm feeling just a joke of a person who has my own battles.  But then I turn it around and think, well at least posting here is possibly one of the things that I can do that is perhaps 'right'.  I mean, the amount of feedback I've had from you wonderful people has shown me that.
But with all these stressors at the moment and the massive question is:  what’s it all for??  Where is the next smile going to come from? But really, will a smile make all that much of a difference??  
What do I want??????    I don’t know – not to be continually stuck in an office everyday of the week.  Not to be injured.  Well, neither of these will ever come true – well one will but that’s so far off in the  future that it’s not worth thinking about and the other one would be if I stopped one of my biggest passions in life – to work out.
So the clock ticks on, the day progresses and the endless cycle just continues on.
Thanx for reading.
Neil

I'm just reaching out. My diagnosis has floored me. Medication is mad. So much of it. I stopped taking my medication for 3 days. My doctor today said I look like a heroin addict and that it was a very stupid thing for me to do. 3 days from regular me post diagnosis to physically unwell, to the point of nearly requiring hospitalisation. Back on Meds full swing. Feel so much better already.

Hi. I'm not sure if I'm looking for answers or just somewhere to express myself.
for the past 3 or 4 months I feel like I've gone back to a place where I was 10 years ago. I'm not sure if it's a result of whats happening around me or not- I just feel either devoid of emotion or really sad.
about 10 years ago I was hospitalised in a youth psychiatric ward as depressed. I had a horrible experience at the Austin hospital and I don't  want to repeat it. Although I've managed over the years (all be it at times I have struggled) these past few months I've gone back into a rut. I guess I have all of the tele tale signs/ feeling sad/anxious, little enjoyment, no sex drive, ect.
in particular, because of a few missed job opportunities and a lot of pressure at work and study along with sons arguments with family I'm slowly going back to my black, helpless place where I'm worthless and where moone understands me.
its so hard for me to see a doctor as im
pretty disillusioned with the whole system. Does anyone have any ideas of how I can stop myself going down that slippery slope again?

I'm new to BB and have been reading your stories and comments for a couple of weeks. So many of the things you write about resonate deeply within me, and I feel less isolated.
Does anyone experience disordered/out of control eating or restraining from eating behaviour?  Since childhood (am 55) my eating pattern and weight has been unhealthy - going from skinny to fat - being an anorexic teenager, young adult - then into bulimia (restraining/exercising) for most of my adult life.  Several times, over the years, especially during times of extreme distress/depression - my restraining pattern turned into bingeing, like a form of self-soothing or comfort.  Most recently, life has become overwhelmingly challenging and the binge eating pattern has returned.  I've lost control and feel completely ashamed and repulsed by myself, my body and my eating.  I've withdrawn from most of my friends and just want to stay in my apartment, watch tv and hide.
I was proud of myself when I was in control of my eating and exercising daily.  My body was lean, I could feel my bones.  It's a tremendous feeling - a high - and very much in-sync with who I am - a perfectionist.  When things look to be in order - house perfect, appearance 'perfect' (not that it ever is!) - life feels safe, life makes sense and I feel in control.
That has all gone.  I know that even when we feel ""in control"", the feeling is largely illusion, however, now the illusion has gone.    I've been without work for almost two years, live alone, divorced - for the second time, and have a mortgage.  This is especially agonising as I had left work for full time uni, gained a degree, worked for a time in a related field - and now am in a worse position than I was before uni.  (trying not to use too may ""I's"", sorry!!!)
This is deteriorating into a ramble.  My thoughts are confused.  Have been on antidepressant for about 15 years and found they help to stabilise my mood and outlook.  For the last 18mths or so, this hasn't been the case and I've become increasingly depressed, withdrawn, confused.  Self-confidence has vanished.  Self-esteem has also vanished. I see myself as a failure in most areas of my life.  
There are two people in my life who support, accept and love me, despite the depression.  They are a priceless blessing.  They don't really understand depression, and I often feel embarrassed and incredibly selfish in discussing my situation with them.  Often, the best strategy for me is ""cave dwelling"" - laying low, staying at home, withdrawing from contact.  That way, I don't have to wear a mask (which is SO exhausting), explain myself or expose anyone to my dark mood.
Yesterday was a particularly bad day for uncontrolled eating.  Today I feel physically and emotionally sick, drained and disgusted.  This cycle has caught me in an iron grip.  This is the first time I've talked about it.  I would be unbearably ashamed if anyone recognised me or knew about my problem.  I disgust myself.
I have sort support, and hopefully will be commencing soon.  Can't happen soon enough!
Hopefully this makes some sort of sense to someone.  It may strike a chord with you, if you battle similar demons.  Reading stories of others here on BB has helped me to feel less isolated.  If some of my rambling helps one person, it makes the effort worthwhile
 
Whatever you are facing today, I hope you find the strength, peace and resilience you need to get through ......

Hi All
I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety 15 years ago. Initally my treatment went along well, made alot of progress with reducing anxiety and I thought the depression.
However, the past 12 months or so I have noticed I have been deterioating. Depression is rearing its ugly head again, despite medication and seeing psychiatrist. Feeling pretty low, depressed about the battle of depression.
 I understand the depression is not me, but I am getting fed up. Teary and cry a fair bit in the evenings. 
Relcutant to have to tell family and friends again, they have seen this all before and feel bad. Concerned they might be sick of it trying to help/support.
Does anyone else relate to this?

These lyrics just go round in my head sometimes. I think why am I struggling? I don't have half the problems that other people have. Why do I seek something else to take the edge off? Why is alcohol my go to solution? I am here this morning after waking up pretty seedy after a sleepless night of rapid heart beats and dehydration. My first thought is ""have another drink.. it will make you feel better"" And I did and it does. But I know it too will wear off and then what? Can I just keep going like this? Is this my life? I tell myself this is the last time but I'm not sure I really believe it.

Hi guys.  I am so emotionally empty today.  Disconnected.  Like all my feelings are having a holiday, or I'm viewing them from another room.  They are there... but not there.
I can laugh but it doesn't reach my heart.  Or smile but it doesn't reach my eyes. 
I don't feel bad.  I don't feel good.  I just feel empty.
Like there's nothing inside me.  Like I've got nothing left to give.  
I don't know why.  Life is going great for me right now, things are really starting to pick up.  So why am I so numb?
What can I do to feel again?

Hi, 
I am new here, not new to depression have been struggling for the last 3 years. Different medication, trips to hospital etc. My depression has been caused by stress which has lead to anxiety, then depression. I work as a professional and have always seen myself as a perfectionist. Made some minor mistakes that started to set off the anxiety, then depression. 
My world is falling apart around me, i feel like I am never going to get better and that I will eventually lose everything. I hate myself at the moment, giving up feels like the easy option? 
I cant get back to see my psychiatrist for another few days. :(

I have been depressed for a long time but only started taking antidepressant 4 months ago. I remember it was dark and deep. Just like how most of us feel, exhausted and hopeless. I was suicidal. It felt like ending this life was the only way out. But I was lucky my bf fully supported me. My doctors put me on the medication and made sure I had all the support I needed. Things got better for a few weeks until I started losing weight and sleep. I started to get sick more frequently.  Then before I knew it, it comes back. I can feel myself sliding back into the deep darkness. I started withdrawing myself, crying and feeling guiltu. I dont know how to fight it because I am exhausted everyday. And I really don't want my bf to put up with me anymore.  It is not fair. I know a lot of us ask this question but when is it going to end?

Hello,I am a female in my early 30's and have just been diagnosed with severe depression and mild anxiety. I have a good job that I have been working in for over 10 years and have had ups and downs in my life like most people. I had a rocky childhood and teen years however from my early 20's my life has been fairly stable and I have always been a happy person trying to do the best in life. In the space of a few weeks I felt like I hit a wall, I lost interest in everything, work, gym, getting out of bed, even brushing my hair. I felt as though I just could not  function. I have been referred to a psychologist who seems lovely and my Doctor had prescribed me medication this was nearly four weeks ago. I have had terrible side effects and I don't feel any better at all, in fact, I feel nothing, no happiness, sadness or any other feelings. I was very hesitant to touch medication, however was convinced when the psychologist  advised me it would ""give me my life back"". I am now worried what will happen if it doesn't work on me, I'm currently on extended sick leave from work and have had to make up an illness to my boss, family and friends because I didn't feel I could tell them what's really wrong. Especially at work I fear I would be discriminated against and seen as weak. Has anyone had  a similar experience? Does medication work on everyone?  Has anyone had any positive experiences? any advice would be so much appreciated. Thank you

Hi. I had a nervous breakdown about 9 years ago now. Since then I have been 'retired' from work, and am under the care of a psychiatrist. I am medicated at present. 
I was reading an article today which talked depression suffered by a few high profile people - John Hamm and Ruby Rose amongst them. In essence, John's story was 'got sick, took anti-depressants, now I'm back', while Ruby's was more 'have suffered from this most of my life'.
Do you/ CAN you ever get better from this? My doctors says I will never be what I was before. I feel like I have lost so much. I know I have changed a lot, but I would like to get back some of my energy and enthusiasm. I feel like I've been sick forever. 
Can anyone help me? Cheers, Kyles

Hi all,Im not usually one to post these types of things but feeling pretty down tonight and thought I might share. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 5 years ago. I have kept it to myself for years, no one would suspect me as someone with a mental illness, I have a supportive family, have been in a relationship for 4 years now and generally live a normal and happy life in the eyes of everyone around me. Sometimes though, I wish that they would understand the complexities of my illness and how their actions or words effect me behind closed doors. My partner skips around my issues most of the time, when I start to feel anxious about something and tell him I am upset, he forgets how hard I take things and gets angry at me for being upset. Its just a circle, I get upset, he gets angry then I get more upset, work myself up, sometimes have a panic attack, sometimes feel like harming myself, sometimes feel like putting myself out of my misery. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions on how to help your partner understand your illness? Or how they can help in these situations? Would be great to hear from people in similar situations.

Hi all
Geoff and I are in the middle of a discussion about this which we are working thru separately.
several weeks ago I was suicidal, my thoughts were out of my control & I would of done anything to feel better but nothing worked-it took time & talking on here to get through that terrible period. I'm now seeing my Pyschiatrist again & she believes I've gone as far as I can with medication. That there are issues in my life I need to confront in order to ever get better.
i wondered what you all thought? I'd always believed it was so debilitating that there was nothing I could do but endure it.
But now I've been told depression can be overcome by improving Selfesteem, having a purpose, challenging negative thoughts & confronting my fear & avoidance. My pysch said 'depression doesn't control you unless you let it'. She also suggested a book called ""Beating the Blues"" which doesn't provide for depression except challenging behaviours. 
i feel overwhelmed. If I have to do this alone, where do I start?  Would appreciate opinions Lve Mares

Just needed to post somewhereHave suffered depression most of my life, but since 2009 its been getting worse and over the last year, so bad that there seems to be no end in sight. I've seen psychiatrists, psychologists and taken medication but nothing seems to have ""taken"", partly because I have, at least prior to 2011 tried to please the specialists I've been seeing and made out like things were improving, when they were not.I feel like a caged and wounded animal, I feel like a nothing. I no longer have friends,bar one , who is an ex-partner. My family is part of the problem - my upbringing and more recently my mother have caused my great unhappiness and I cannot get over it - I know I need to forgive and move on, but how? They don't recognise that they ever did anything wrong, they don't see how I can be so hurt by them bending over backwards and doing everything they can to help my sister through her tough times (which is appropriate) but they could never, ever try and do anything to help my through this, in fact going out of their way to make it worse. My family loves me but only because of familial bonds - there is no mutual respect, there is no attempt by them to understand or know me in any way.Every night I go to bed and pray that I don't wake up. I manage to get through work, come home, and either cry or sit and feel numb. I have nobody to talk to and I'm scared I'm going to do something stupid because my only friend is leaving the country for a month and then I really will have nobody to talk to.I just want this to stop. I have no life to speak of. I have no joy, nothing to look forward to. If I try and go out, I become overwhelmed and leave usually in tears, because I know I don't belong out there among decent, normal human beings.I'm sorry for the rambling nature of this post, I cannot think coherently at present and I apologise to those who may have wasted their time reading this.beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

So, this post is a long time in the making! The reason I've not done anything about how I feel is because I just can't explain how I feel exactly. I think I'm depressed and I think it's getting worse, although I do wonder if it's just me being lazy so that I don't have to achieve anything in my life, like maybe I'm making it all up to explain why after almost 32 years of existence I still haven't achieved anything. 
I can't recall a time in the last 15 years where I've been happy for an extended period of time. I asked my Dr many years ago why I felt awful, couldn't sleep & had a constant tightness in my chest and he said it was because ""I was going through a rough patch in my life"" as I was in a terrible relationship, hated my job and things with my friends were starting to change. I figured he was probably right and that things would get better. 
Anyway, fast forward to today and things aren't better and have hardly gotten better since then. My boyfriend of 4 years says I'm the most negative person he has ever known!! This is coming from the person who loves me the most in the world, who doesn't want to be without me. Though I don't know why, I'm so awful to him at times I make him cry & make him feel bad about himself to take the spotlight off of me! I feel so lost sometimes that I just cry. Some days are good, some are great, and some are just down right awful. I don't share my feelings with my partner or my family as I just can't talk about this stuff and I feel like I've been acting ""Ok"" for such a long time around them that I don't know how to be truthful, although there is a long line of depression in my family. I hate the thought of coming across as weak and I don't want to share my feelings with them, I guess that's why I came here instead.
My current situation is this: Unemployed after losing my job last year, (I had a job for about 3 months that made me so anxious I was physically sick for the entire time & couldn't handle it so had to resign, even though my boss told me she didn't want me to because I was doing such a great job!), absolutely no income & having to borrow from my partner to pay my personal bills so now in debt, applying for jobs and getting absolutely no response (studying online in the meantime), sleeping patterns drastically changed so bed at 5am and up at 11am or 12pm, no motivation to do anything, anxious to talk on the phone or to go out, living in a town where I have no friends but unable to make friends as anything social is getting harder & harder for me and it goes on and on. 
There are so many more things going on I could talk about but I've gone on long enough. I just don't know where to start. I feel like my ""normal"" or ""happy"" feelings are neither normal nor truly happy, but I can't remember not being like this. I see people who seem genuinely happy and I know that's not how I feel. I don't want to act anymore, it's exhausting lying to people who care about you. It feels awful to tell your mother that ""Things are great"" when earlier that morning you were disappointed that you actually woke up. 
Even now I've sat for 10 minutes contemplating whether to push the Post this thread button because I'm afraid it's the wrong thing to do! I'm pushing it now & hope that someone out there might be able to offer my some kind of insight! Thanks in advance

I feel like I'm a punching bag, taking hit after hit. My gp has prescribed medication an I don't know what to do. I have had alot of bad experiences with meds an I just don't want it to stop me from being able to express myself when I allow it. My counsellor thinks I need to have a ""meltdown"" an just allow it to happen, an I know they are right, I don't know how to tho. Sorry, it's not making much sense. I just don't know what to do anymore? What's the point?

I pray to wake up without tears of dread.  
I pray that my children will see me smile again 
i pray that the empty, lost person I am
will one day learn to live again.
I don't think I'm asking for the world. I'm asking for myself to be found under the crushing pain. I'm asking for help to lift that load so I know how to live in freedom again. The hopelessness, despair & self hate are my only companions, beating me down to the point I myself can't be found. Please please help me, I fall lower each day and the fight gets greater each day. I have no one. My husband can't handle it & finds solace in work, I've isolated myself from everyone I know. I used to be the life of the party. Now I don't recognise who I am.  It's so true what one member wrote-that she didn't want to die but more importantly she didn't want to live. Yes that's me. I have to live for others but I can't find a reason for myself right now.

Hi Everyone,
The depression has got much deeper. I'm now utterly exhausted and feeling hopeless and so so tired - not just physically but mentally and re trying. I'm still going to try but I don't want to get out of bed now. I can't function or think and have slept these last few days day and night waking for short periods.I don't want to wake up - I just want to sleep and stop. Stop trying. (No - I'm not suicidal but it is very dark). I get energy and start positive things for a time and then it all gets sucked away by this extreme tiredness.
Please help
Suz

The friend that held my hand today and has been through depression herself said something that was passed onto her. ""Depression is anger turned inwards"". Still out on that re the jury of my mind but it did hit a cord. What does everyone else think? I think there is some merit to that saying to some degree...
Cheers

Feel alone, isolated and unloved. How worse can it get?

Hello Beyond Blue community,

I have depression that is most prominent in DEC-JAN-FEB of every year, hence the 3 tablespoons. It's only now that it's really clicked that it's those months specifically and it's when my father passed away 10 years ago now. I still get dished out some heavy weeks here and there but I feel like a steady 4 out of 12 months I am just good for nothing.

I have got a referral for a psychiatrist and waiting at the phone for that call when I can go and see them. I tried last year to get better and fell back into smoking pot which I've used several times to ""get better"" (more like forget about it so I never get well).

I'm getting really bad now, my mum has severe depression and has admitted herself to a mental ward in the past. I feel bad for stacking my problems on hers so I rarely do, and I live away from most of my family. I have a good life, a lovely girlfriend and a wonderful sharehome but i still can't stop these feelings of despair.

Can anyone recommend any good psychologists that practice in Melbourne I can get to quickly? I feel like a tiny wall that's got lucky in the eye of the storm but will be destroyed any time soon...

Sincerely,

Bellamy

Hi everyone, 
Just wondering if anybody else experiences extreme fatigue as a side effect of depression? I'm suffering quite badly from it at the moment, and it makes everything such an effort. I feel drained and crushed constantly, and no matter how much sleep I get it doesn't go away :/ And I try not to use caffeine because I got addicted to it in the past, and it also makes my anxiety levels high.
Does anyone have any ways they use to cope with extreme tiredness??

I am home alone and really struggling at the moment. I have been battling the thoughts all day and none of my safety tools have worked. I really don't know wat else to do. Really lost and going down with every passing hr i feel.
I am scared that i am going to do something but something has always stopped me, i don't know what that something is. I know i go into hospital on monday but i'm just so lost and feel i have being deserted by my family, friends, cousins i let them all know what i am going through and none of them have been msging me or being in contact with me. Why? I thought when you are down u seek support from those groups of people, obviously i was wrong again.
Don't deserve any happiness or anything for that matter. I'm a lost cause i feel. Forget it.
Chris

Sometimes i feel like i am taking a pill because of life the way it is.., not me does that make sense?. I look at news governments and think what a mess, why do people have to make this so much harder for others?. I'm tired of peoples attitudes around, their motives..I feel like everyone is trying to control one another.. or people are just to damn bossy!!! .

Hi guys,
I have been really humbled by the responses to my post, ""Depression is not a cold....."". It proved to me that no matter what our ethnicity , sex, age or social status we all have the one thing inn common- to be understood , not judged or paid lip service.
What I also read was that we all put ourselves last. We worry about  how our depression affects our family, friends, partners, kids.
We feel guilty for being sick. we put off treatment because our family won't cope without us and meanwhile we get worse.
I have been very distresses for the last few days and have taken comfort in posting here. but it is not enough. Ican't do this anymore. I need to be able to tell my nearest and dearest I am sick.
My psych has been trying to get me to see this for years - and I think I get it. you all have helped me see how wrong we are in how we view our illness and yes it is an illness just like, cancer or heart condition. 
it needs treatment and without it can be life threatening.
guys tonight when my husband asks what is wrong as I know he will, ( I know he senses a shift in me as he's been thru it before) I am going to tell the truth. I am sick. I feel very sad, anxious scared and don't really know why.
Let the chips fall where they may! I can't cope with the secrets and lies anymore.
wish me luck
be kind to your selves

Today is not a good day. I feel very alone....I am finding it hard to express just how I am feeling. I don't have anyone in my life and that is making dealing with  my illness even harder. Most people seem to have a partner/husband/friends/family around in some capacity. I do not. And it is all at my own doing. I responded to someone on here a few days ago who expressed similar feelings but they talked about having a supportive husband and children. I suggested that their feelings of being a terrible person, unworthy and incapable of love and care could not be true as they had their husband and children- it would not be possible for them to have that if they were the way they felt they are. That has stayed with me as clearly I am unable to have a relationship of any kind. So that must mean that I really am just a terrible person, not worth anything to anyone. No one wants to be around me.  I am completely alone. I sit in my home day after day with no interaction with anyone. No one calls to see how I am or ask me to spend time with them. I am just left to myself. I am completely isolated. I have nothing  to look forward to. Nothing brings me joy. I don't know what I like or am interested in. I feel so lost. I feel so unloved. I feel so uncared for. I feel like I don't exist. I feel so pathetic. I am drowning in self pity but not having anyone who believes in me or even likes me makes it seem almost impossible to get out of. I have made so many mistakes in my life and it feels like this is what I deserve.
I recently reached out to a couple of people from my past work. Neither of them has answered me. Being ignored like that just makes me believe even more how bad I am. I must be. It was and is very hard for me to reach out to anyone so that in itself was a huge thing for me. And being silently rejected by them has pushed me back to where I was. There is no one in my corner. I am all alone and feel completely invisible to the world.

Since the end of last year I have been feeling very down on myself and sometimes feeling a sense of loneliness and mainly depression. I often wake  up in cold sweats and frequently battle to get to sleep unless I am extremely tired from work and what not. After the end of year exams last year I've been under a lot of stress and it has really been getting to me. I have had thoughts of suicide because I've just gotten to the point of thinking that everyone would just be better off not worrying about me and just going about their business. I haven't spoken to any friends or family because I feel like I'll be laughed at and or told that people have much bigger issues than I do. Please help me figure out what I need to do to get some help before my schooling plummets along with my social life.

I've found myself stuck in a never ending loop of what i like to call ""R&R"".
Not your typical R&R... i wish it was restful & relaxing... but a physically
& emotionally draining process of falling, recovery & repeat. 
my life at the moment is a cocktail of problems with shots on the side every 
second i have a chance to take a minute to breathe... i feel as if i'm drowning
& have lost any kind of control over anything.
Anyone relate?

First post in this forum:
*scatters hugs and squares of chocolate*
 
Depression snuck up on me ..bit by bit- year by year , until it had me covered in a thick cloak which weighed me down , physically and mentally .
Finally a doctor's appointment was made when I had trouble literally putting one foot in front of the other ! The diagnosis was a complete shock .. OTHERS had depression .. I knew family/friends with it .. this wasn't it, was it? Surely this was MS or a virus , or something...
Nope ..just  depression & anxiety ... and so began the search for professional people and medication to aid in managing this .'Tis an interesting journey ...it hurts,it is debilitating,it is confusing,and it is the thing which has led me to think more and do things differently.

Hi all I posted after my dreadful pysch appointment yesterday but it hasn't shown up. Maybe because I mentioned my Psychiatrists only response to how I'm feeling. She wants me to be hospitalised to receive what I believe to be an extreme form of treatment usually reserved for few cases. My husband and I are in total dear. He's making me go to my mums for the week. But I have to get there myself and its an hr away. I can't even seem to pack a a bag as I'm so afraid of what power my psych has. Can she force this on me? I also saw mt GP to get a referral to a did rent Pyschiatrist but I can't afford her-$470 per session!! I'm frightened, crying, feel no hope, don't know how ill get thru this. I know I have to get to my mums before I do anything which gives my Pyschiatrist reason to do what she would do ie hospitalise and force draconian treatment. I'm so so scared. I just want to be held & told it will be ok. But it won't. I won't have computer at mums just iPhone so I can still come on here. What else can I say? Never ever beloved I could ever be in this situation & I'm self aware etc-the treatment she wants me to have is I thought-only used in extreme cases. I'm so lost now. My spirit that holds up my heart & gives me strength is too damaged. Mares x

I have huge self esteem issues that is placing my quest to get better. I was trying to get a referral from a GP however I either couldn't answer their questions or was just simply meandering in my answers. I have been feeling awful about my life, work and studies for some time and I fear it is getting worse. I sleep too much and I question everything about myself. I feel isolated and unintelligent. I'm constantly anxious while contemplating the uselessness of my life. I fee utterly worthless, unaccomplished and stupid; beliefs that I think are the root of my increasing anxiety and depression. Does anyone else have problems in discussing their issues on a face-to-face basis? And what are some simple tips to alleviate such awful self esteem?

I have been suffering from depression for so long I have actually forgotten when I was first diagnosed. I had been taking one type of medication for some years but discussions with my psychologist and dr that has changed. Since starting, it has not seemed to have changed how I feel, in fact I feel somewhat worse. I am groggy most of the day, wake up with nausea and when I manage to sleep it is a combination of vivid bad dreams, not nightmares, but not far from them. These dreams tend to be a mix of memories and dreaming. I find I am angry to the point of wanting to break a glass or something, not that I have done this literally, but I feel this way. It is as if something is trying to get the the surface but doesn't quite make it. I am unhappy and keep relieving and going over bad things that have happened to me in the past. Things I don't want to remember. Most of my day is spent feeling low and worthless. I am married and although my hubby is very supportive I find I get angry with him for the simplest stupidest things. I yell and scream over mole hills, which to me are mountains. Has any one out there felt like this. In a fit of despair I mentioned this on another site and was told I should get a referral to a psychiatrist and perhaps go in to a clinic to get all my meds sorted. Please help me, please tell me that this is not so weird and that I am not going mad. I only came to this site because I saw an ad. Thanks for **listening** to my rant.

I woke this morning in such pain. I realised that for a very long time now I have not been coping. This would have been obvious to anyone - I have lost 12 kg in a short space of time, cannot eat, cry all the time, cannot concentrate or work, am negative, etc. The weird thing is that I know this and vaguely do things, tell people but don't 'do ' anything serious. I don't do what I would like someone to do . That would be say to myself, and what some of you here have said to me and others,"" wow you are in a bad place,  really bad. What can you do about it."" I have sat in it thinking it would magically get better, or that it really wasn't THAT bad or I don't know what.The other weird thing is ' no one else in my life has either'. My sister and mother know that I am quite depressed. My best friend also, and I have said to various people that I am struggling 'a little' . People don't do anything. I unconsciously have chosen my name quite well. In Charlottesometimes (a book) the girl goes to bed and wakes up in a different time, swapping with the girl from the other time. They do this at random, unpredictable nights, swapping into each others lives and times.. And no one notices the difference.   As long as they do what they/the other is meant to be doing. Maybe they have and I'm the one who didn't notice.I need help. I am going back on medication.I realised too that I am actually quite angry. Beneath the pain is anger. I read someone else's post and they talked about wanting someone to notice they had withdrawn and respond. I understand that. I don't like it. I don't want to be that passive person. What is the line between wanting to be cared about and not taking responsibility?I am angry that I wasn't looked after. I am angry that my experience led me to believe I was and still am not worthy of attention, care, consideration. That I don't trust when people spend time with me, I am afraid that they are tricking me.I am angry that someone in my life wanting to include other people in an activity we do makes me feel so rejected that I spiral down and consider suicide. How is this possible.

Well I was away over the weekend and doing a bit of reading it looks like I missed some computer dramas: my absolute favourite (not!)

I fell off the wagon on Saturday. In terms of drink and in letting my anxiety get the better of me, and I'm annoyed and disappointed in myself. For some weeks, I'd been working myself up to join a new social group, something that is very outside of my comfort zone but something I have wanted to do for years.

Saturday morning came, I got all the way there, took one look at all the people and panicked. I got straight back in my car and went home. I tried to distract myself as best I could for the day, but those little demons and voices would not leave me alone. I accepted that they were there, just like I've been taught, but it still felt crap.

I tried not to beat myself up too much, but by the evening I decided I needed a drink, so I stayed up into the small hours drinking and watching rubbish on television.  I felt awful on Sunday, and I'm ashamed to say I didn't go into work on Monday.  As I knew it would, the drink made my depression worse so I've been in a numb haze feeling sorry for myself.

Thankfully I have woken this morning with a lighter head and a better perspective, hopefully it will be a lesson of strength for next time. I don't know what I'm going to do about the social group. I don't know whether I want to try again, or whether I should jsut leave it because it seems I am not ready to take that step yet.

i feel completely disoriented in this world these days. career, $$, relationship, it all feels like it's completely going down the tubes and taking me with it. my career is dead, i've worked 2 years out of 6. i'm hanging on to what little cash i have left. others say it's not that bad. to cheer up. but i feel like i'm on the slippery slope, that i'm losing strength. everything scares the daylights out of me. i cant shake the fact i know two people my age that have committed suicide in the last year. i dont feel like that, but i do feel that life has become utterly terrifying.

 I'm lost and no longer know what to do to help myself, I've tried multiple types of antidepressants, I've seen therapists, counsellors and even been into a mental health clinic, even though I was stubborn and didn't want to be there at all. I don't know what else to do because I still feel so empty and sad every day. I don't want to wake up of a morning time anymore.

Apologies if this a long post..
I'm finding myself back in a place that I seem to get every few months or so. Its a complicated feeling, i wouldn't say i'm emotional, i wouldn't say i'm sad, if anything, i have no real emotion, not sad, not happy. I withdraw when i'm in these moods, i don't want to leave the house if i can avoid it, i stop going to training because i don't want to be around the people, i avoid social gatherings. Any confrontation that i might have with someone will leave my completely drained and emotionless for at least a day or two. Today i just couldn't handle work, just had this anxious feeling i couldn't get rid for a few hours.
The problem is, these moods on any given day can be normal. I start to wonder if i'm over complicating, trying to look too deeply for a solution to a problem that could be solved simply. Maybe i'm just more comfortable on my own. Maybe i'm not sleeping well because i always have to get up a 5am for work. Maybe its normal to not feel strong feelings either way for your fiancee for weeks at a time.
I can usually just get through being rational. I know i care for my fiancee, and i am grateful for the life we are building. And every now and then i do feel strong feelings of love for her. i can get through work without emotion, because its just a series of problems to solve. I'm not a zombie, i am still capable of laughing at a joke, i still see my parents on the weekend, i'm not constantly miserable. I see a problem, i come up with a solution.
But i keep coming back here, where I realise i have been completely unemotional for the past week or two, been completely unmotivated to do anything other than what i need to do, but feeling no joy about it. Where everyone seems to irritate me, but i cant handle any confrontation without it draining me. It doesn't feel extreme, but it has repeated itself time and time again for years. One time when i was 18 i packed all my things and tried moved interstate to get away from everyone, family and friends. After 3 months i came back once i realised i didn't hate being around them.
Is this depression? is it possible to have less extreme cases, where it doesn't end relationships or careers, but stops you from socialising, or makes you unable to reciprocate feelings of love and joy for a time? I have seeked medical advice before, but its not an easy thing to explain to a GP in a 15min session. Once time it was a disaster, one GP diagnosed me with bipolar (after ONE consultation) and put me on medication which turned me into a complete zombie for two days before i got a second opinion. Ironically, once i came off the medication it seemed to snap me out of it. I guess i just want to see if people can relate to what i'm feeling. I just find it hard to justify seeking help, as it doesn't seem serious enough, but then again, i'm sick of having to drag myself out of a slump every 2 months.

Hi all, my previous thread named ""No hope this week"" was getting a bit too long so today I'm extending and continuing the themes of that post.Yes I have a broken heart. I am aching from the current constant state of emotional & mental pain. I have cried as soon as I wake up for the past two weeks.Just to contextualise I will refer to my last post where I described my experience of a sudden severe onset of deep depression & thoughts I had never really experienced before as in I wouldn't act on them because my kids have always been my safety net. I experienced a severe onset of depression without any triggers & I was feeling completely out of control of my thoughts, unable to function barely at all to the point I couldn't even get dressed & I felt totally immobilised & absolutely terrified of my mental state.I had never had contact with an acute mental health team but due to my distress & complete sense of being out of control, Beyond Blue contacted them on my behalf. The nurses visited me at home & were lovely. They made me an appointment with the acute team pyschiatrist last Wednesday.Unfortunately the pysch was young & obviously inexperienced. It was only a 15min appt & the sole purpose was to check I wasn't having intentions to do anything terrible. I was hoping for some referrals to other forms of support & a medication review. But the pysch said he would be phoning my private pysch that day to update her & to ""hand over care"".So I waited & remained in my terrible state of mind. I progressively got worse. I hadn't heard from my own Pyschiatrist so I rang her today & she was completely unaware of what was happening. I asked her if the acute team had explained my situation & couldn't believe it when she replied ""oh yes they left a message last week for me to call them but I haven't got to it yet"".I was so shocked-this is a Pysch I've been seeing for over 8 yrs. so I told her all that had happened & that my husband was adamant that I crashed when I began taking the stimulant medication she had prescribed & I had commenced it on 10 January & fell apart on the 20th January.She replied that she didn't think they were related & perhaps the current widespread news about abuse in the Catholic Church had triggered it. I replied that I hadn't seen any news on the subject & wasn't even aware it was a current issue in the media.She then said to stay on my medication & she would see me next Monday & discuss possible triggers for my sudden crash & also discuss medication. I even told her I had never experienced an episode like this & I certainly have never had serious thoughts of taking drastic action-and her reply was that if I felt some sympathetic nurses would cheer me up then I could ask the Acute Team to visit.I was beyond words when the phone call ended. This is supposed to be my treating pysch who I've known for over 8 years. My husband who took the morning off work due to my state, called BB distressed & said he couldn't cope with what was happening & needed support for me as he just couldn't cope with what was happening & the lack of support services for me.I then said to him I felt safe enough this afternoon to be alone & would occupy myself by coming here & writing & also looking up GPs & Pyschologists. There is still the major critical issue of a decent Pyschiatrist. So basically I have to survive until Monday & the only other option or change would be if I continued having serious thoughts-in that event I would be admitted to hospital.So how do I feel after explains all the current facts-I feel so upset, desperate, alone, frightened, overwhelmed & broken hearted at the current state, the underfunded & lack of support services for mental health compared to other health areas, the sadness & fear at being overwhelmed by this illness, and most of all today my heart breaks at the loss & grief I feel for struggling so hard to ""find my real self"" under the layers of the illness & sadness that my family rarely see & enjoy experiences with the person I truly am beyond this illness.They see the symptoms & the struggles & my mum cried & my husband was distressed at how much this illness has taken from my life. They say how much they ""miss me"" & how it breaks their hearts to know who I truly am & to grieve for that person because they now mostly see the effects of the illness & the rare glimpses they see of the person they know I am makes it even harder as they miss me so much.I grieve for myself too-I am so sad knowing I still exist but I'm hidden under layers of pain & trauma & the devastation this illness can cause. Will I ever feel happy again? Will I ever return to the bright social butterfly who had many friends. Will I ever feel a sense of achievement again when I was such a high achiever & thrived on mental stimulation & challenges. Will I ever break this despair? This loss of the real me? Will I ever be social or interact again given I'm completely isolated & rarely leave the house & have no one to talk to from the time my kids go to school to the time they come home?And the biggest question-will I ever experience recovery or even hope of some forms of recovery? I'm so broken by this constant battle. And the destruction it creates in so many ways ie low or zero Selfesteem, feeling a failure, losing confidence in most of my abilities, blaming myself for anything, apologising for anything to the point I'm almost apologising for my existence, feeling unlovable, avoiding people & situations because I fear being transparent as a loser. Fearing this could get even worse.So basically fearing a lifetime of struggle to find myself again when I'm up against a monster of an illness that's winning at the moment. I'm too afraid to think of the future because if this is my future then my existence is purely for the sake of my children. And I'm so sad because if I had known the battle I'd have with depression, traumatic events, PTSD & anxiety-I would of crammed so much into my life before it hit me so at least I'd experienced happiness & adventures & many different experiences so at least I could say I made the most of and lived my life to the absolute fullest before I got sick.I don't in anyway want to or mean to come across as a victim in feeling sorry for myself. I know there are so so many people hurting & struggling in so many ways & forms & it can always be worse. So my intention isn't meant to express myself as the only person in pain. I am grateful for many things such as my children & living in a country without war or external traumas.I try to be thankful & humble for what I do have & do think of and feel for all people in pain or suffering whatever form it may take.I just felt so sad today I needed to try express myself to keep me safe & to clarify my thoughts by attempting to express them-as in doing so I thought I might feel some of the fog lift. So I've literally just written this without thought & I hope it makes sense.I think of, and feel for all of you experiencing pain & battling this illness. I care & hope I can support many of you on this journey. And I'd also like to express my sincere gratitude for all of you & especially to thank those who have provided me with hope & care.Today I know one of my dear friends is battling through this illness & my heart goes out to them. I hope each of you experience some hope, support & care.Lve Mares xxx

Hi. I'm new here so hope I don't ramble on like an idiot. So I guess I should explain why I'm here. I quite worried about my mental health but don't know how to get help. I am a full time uni student and so can't afford the high fees and although I tried to talk to my go about this ages ago and asked about the mental health program, he shut me down and sent me on my way with a handful of antidepressants and benzodiazapines, none of which helped 
So some background is that I seem to experience either being really happy or really depressed. The past few weeks I've just hit rock bottom. This weekend I have spent all my time at home ignoring the world and wanting  to  kill  myself. It it wasn't for how my sister would cope with it I would hopefully be gone by now, but I just can't do that to her. At my lowest I came close to hurting myself and had written her and my boyfriend a letter explaining why as well as I could. But because of her I didn't and indulged in some help harm to relieve a bit of the pain. I have been self  harming on and off for as longs as I can remember but have gotten a bit better since I entered a good relationship at the start of the year. I do it where it can't be seen but obviously my boyfriend can see it. During this time I have pushed him away and he's frustrated that he can't do anything right. Either he leaves me alone like I say and I  get  angry or he contacts me to see how I am and I  get  angry. And I've been nasty and saying some horrible things to him but he is nothing but nice to me 

 
but then I'm either like this or the complete opposite. I hardly sleep and I feel on top of the world. I feel like everything's fallen into place and come up with all these grand plans. Because of this I'm studying at the moment but have done a few different courses and have almost finished my degree finally (I'm 29) but I hate it and don't want to work in the field but was just a grand plan I had which is how I started doing it. I clean all the time, even other people's houses, can't finish a sentence because my mind goes faster than my mouth and other such things. I get myself into stupid situations all the time by doing things I really shouldn't because they're either illegal or just immoral and it's like I know it's wrong but do then anyway
 
i have a weird thing with numbers. Can't stand even numbers in the slightest and get irritated if things are even. I write things out of my hands all the time and make them fit into certain patterns. Look I feel like this gone on quite long enough and I apologise for that and I generally try calm myself out by drinking quite heavily on a frequent basis. Doesn't really work but I've been self medicating one way or another for the past I dunno maybe 15 years.
 
ive had some significant life events such as sexual attacks, a major leg injury and some major deaths in the family but so have other people and they seem to be much more, I don't wanna use the word normal but that's all I can think of and I guess it fits. 
 
I guess I wrote all this to see if anyone has had similar experiences and/or could give me some idea as to what's wrong with me. And also advise me as to who I can see to get some help with this. I just really can't cope with it anymore and have lots friends and boyfriends and really can't take that happenings again because I can't control my mouth, actions or feelings. Well yeah, I think I've gone over my time here and well thanks for listening and on the off chance anyone's bothered to read this miserable brief of my mind this far and can offer advice, I am eternally thankful. 
 
Anyway yeah. Thanks and take care :) oh I'm a 29 year old female if that makes any difference?

HiI have been diagnosed previously with depression, that was 10 years ago, but then a couple of years ago the doctor amended it to Anxiety. However I was trying to explain to my partner what it feels like, as he is struggling with my mood swings and dealing with me. He often asks me which person he is talking to today, so he can prepare himself. I am a mother of two children and I am struggling to control these swings and I feel terrible about it. I was unable to tell him verbally what it is like and so I wrote it down...   ""I do not understand myself.Most times it is like traveling on a well maintained path weaving its way steadily through a plain landscape, nothing special, and nothing surprising, covered with yellow wheat and the occasional brightly coloured blossom to brighten the scenery or misplaced rock that I stumble over.Then all of a sudden the path lunges in one of two directions. One direction is alive in hyper-colour excitement. All of a sudden I am on top of a mountain looking over the world and there is nothing but good things to look forward to. The pace is fast, the music mesmerising and energetic. Inspiration for fun and exciting adventures come thick and fast, and the draw to do amazing and most of the time, hugely expensive things, is irresistible. I would love to live on top of this mountain, I love the person I am when I am on top of this mountain, I love people, I love life and I enjoy every breath I take. It is better than any orgasm I have ever experienced! However after being on top of this mountain comes the plummet to the otherside where the sun is blocked out by that very mountain, I hate it here. My bed is made out of jagged stone, but getting out of bed seems like a joke. The world is grey and the people in it are painful to listen to and be around. I am unable to do anything right and the sub-voice (I call it Vince) lives here. Vince tells me that I am worthless, I am incompetent and everyone hates me. The mirror mocks me and Vince laughs at the ugliness he see’s peering at him through the glass, how anyone could love or even stand to be near such a hideous creature is proved by the loneliness I feel within this world. Everything is dulled and I get desperate for some colour, some tingle of happiness, a scratch and the tickle is the most pleasurable thing I can imagine. The worst is that this horrible part of me takes over, it wants to embrace this horrible existence and it pushes to remove everyone I love from my life while the other part of me is wondering what I am doing. I don’t want to be alone, I don’t want to be left in this stagnant pit of misery, but I push him out, I scream at them, I try to force him to leave forever, I am nasty to all of them, yet at the same time all I want is for them to hold me and take me back to the top of the mountain or even the plain wheat field. The biggest loser in the world plagued by Vince and the thought that maybe leaving or killing myself would fix all this, but I cling to my kids, and hope that eventually I will find my way back to the wheat field by myself because that is the only safe place to be. While every mountain is followed by the dreadful pit, the pit is not always preceded by a mountain, this is the second direction. I cannot control this, the journey has been better in the last couple of years, especially since the new medication, but the mountain and the pit are always there, they are just further apart lately. Today I have been in the pit; I didn’t even get to enjoy a mountain first, so I feel a little ripped off. I hate myself because there is a sensible part of me that tells me that the things I do when I am on the mountain and the feelings and things I do and say while I am in the pit are ridiculous and thoughtless and I cannot afford, emotionally, financially and physically to keep doing these things, but it is like a mouse trying to conquer a carnivorous elephant.""How do other people who travel the same or similar paths as me cope?

I have been diagnosed bipolar 2 for 5 years, I am on medication, my doctor says he's surprised at how well I cope, I am open and honest about my  bipolar.  But when you are down you are down, I try not to let it explode, I try not to take it out on those around me, I have learnt it is best to say ""my bipolar is giving me a bad time"". 
But sometime you need to let all the garbage in your head out, but experience has taught me you don't talk to other people with issues as it makes mine worse, talking to friends can be OK but they can only handle it once or twice, my husband as brilliant as he is, has worn enough. So there is no one to talk to. 
 
I am down, I am heading to the bottom and I know it, I know I will crash - I have held it off for as long as I can, 3-5 weeks, I know I will have to take a couple of days off work and deal with it but I am over fighting it.  Since being on medication I can see it happening I try to stop it, I am lucky sometimes it works, I haven't had a major for 18 months and my majors seem to not last long, getting to the bottom does but once there I seem to pick up the pieces and move on.  I have to keep finding new ways to get through it; there is no rhyme or reason as to why it happens it just happens.
 I needed to say this I can’t say it out loud, I have walked away from this a few times as the tears slip I know I will have to let go and deal with the down.  Thank you for listening I can go and let go now and start the journey back up to day to day living.

As the heading says, i'm feeling flat. I want company but i have restrictive funds for this coming week. Family things are starting to get on top of me along with my own personal issues, i just feel i'm about to crack under pressure, i'm not sure just how much more of this i can take.
I'm ready to erupt like a volcano if this pressure doesn't lift. My head feels like it's full and take in anymore information,  it just isn't ready and either is my body i can feel it.
At the same time i need to look for work to earn money but i just don't feel ready my meds make me tired and so i'm yawning all the time it just feels so hard. I may come across like i'm going well but this thread i'm just letting all things come out into the open. 
I have a family member that is starting to worry about an operation that is coming up shortly in the next wk or so, so they are a concern. i'm quite sensitive at the moment more than usual.
Fell like i'm in a real bind, between a rock and a hard place. I have a splitting headache at the moment so that isn't helping. I have an ex friend who still keeps having digs at me of something that happened at the start of the year in public places and isn't true. She verbally abused me and indirectly had a go at how my parents raised my 2 older sisters and myself.
Feel like i'm a bull stuck in a cage just ready to be let out.

Hi all
I think the last post of ""Tears"" possibly got too big for its boots ... not that it was wearing any ... it just slops around in flip-flops, or what Aussies call, thongs.  (Now I've got you thinking haven't I?  Who is this guy ... is he Americaan or something?)
No folks ... just a plain old Aussie boy, just thought I'd try for a bit of an unusual start to this post.  Seeing as I can't cry I may as well be silly.  :)
And to answer some questions posed to me of late ... I am feeling, um, a little better.  But that comes and goes, don't it.  Had a rather crap day on Friday, but so far Saturday is going along much better - I think.  Have already been to the gym and smashed out a brilliant workout of chest and finished with biceps.  Two favourite body parts to workout.
This arve, I have a physio session ... and my physio is a wonderful person as well as being highly talented in her field of expertise ... she's almost like a 'closet' psych.  She's been awesome for me in the past.
Yes, I'm on meds ... each and every day ... and heavy amounts of them.  Take one variety each morning;  and then about an hour before beddy byes time, I take two other different varieties.  I often think when I hear of the awful struggles that so many posters have on this site where they can't get to sleep ... I just wish that their psych's or precribing authority would give them appropriate meds so that they can get to sleep as well.  If I didn't have these nightly tablets to take, then I would be one of the many who suffer to the trauma of not being able to sleep at night.
And let's face it, if you ever saw me, you'd be glad that I get a reasonable amount of beauty sleep ... otherwise it (I) wouldn't be a pretty sight !!
And before I wrap this Part II post up, yes, I have my psychologist appointment for next Thursday, 13th February at 10:30am.  And on that day, 23 years ago at 3:20pm, was the time that I lost my brother.  Not that I'm counting mind you!  :(
So Saturday progresses along ... little to smile about.  But hey, it's another day.
Kind regards
Neil

I'm brand new at this, just joined this forum out of confusion and fear of not knowing or understanding.
As a regularly happy person, I am now trying to understand why I have been unhappy for a number of months now.
I am one of those who believe that each individual person can heal themselves with the strength of their own minds. Cure their physical ailments without having to use prescribed drugs and heal their emotional problems by analysing their situation and effecting counter measures.
After many years of adopting this way of thinking, I had to succumb to conventional methods and started using prescribed drugs to help me recover from a heart condition, thus putting a huge dent in my once strong personal beliefs.
I find myself once again at the crossroads of my beliefs, inasmuch as I am battling with emotional problems which I cannot seem to control.
I always thought that depression was purely an emotional issue, that you felt sad due to circumstances brought about by your own thoughts. I am not so sure about that now, thus the reason for this writing.
I have always been able to control my emotions by analysing my feelings and understanding the ""WHY"". That has always worked for me, until now.
I know the problems that I am facing, lack of work, limited income coming in and expenses that have to be serviced, uncertainty of future work, income, etc. 
I know that I am luckier than most men around, I have a wonderful wife who works and supports the household, is caring and totally supportive of me and a beautiful daughter who adores me. I am eating well and we are not starving, I have funds to fall back on, (little as they are), and am still able to meet most of my ongoing debts with the income my wife brings into the household. In short, I know a lot of people that do not have what I have. Yet, I cannot get out of the doldrums.
I am now wondering if 'Depression' is in fact an emotional issue or is it in reality a medical or physical condition much like a cold virus or cancer or something that needs to be treated with a chemical drug.
I know the problems I am facing and I know there are solutions to them. So why do I feel like this???

Last year my daughter had a son, left Australia permanently. We couldn't sell our house.  Finally gave it away for nothing almost.  Then I was ill a lot and on steroids.  Then I was made redundant and we moved house in the same week.  Didn't hit me before Christmas. 
 
Now the blackest ever for the longest period.   Medication has been increased by my nice kind doctor.  Doesn't make any progress, just watch TV and sit at home applying for jobs.  Kind husband who's bewildered.  
 
Sorry to moan.. so black.

If someone asked me ""How are you?"" that would be my honest answer right now. Transient. I feel like I am inbetween one place and the next,except I can't see what that next place is. I'm going somewherebut i don't know where I am going. Is this bad? I know I'd prefer to know where I was going, to give me a goal to work towards so I could speed this up. I don't enjoy being in between. It makes me feel like there's no point making a home here, because I am going to be somewhere else and where I am right now isn't permanent. 

Lately I haven't felt anything. Like in my head I should be feeling something right now, but I can't. I can't feel anything, good or bad. It makes me wonder if there is real emotion there and my head is hiding it from me because it is too painful to feel right now. Like I open up a door and instead of finding answers, I just find a sudden deep black abyss. There should be something there, not a hole. Do I not know the answers? Or is my own head protecting me from them? 

If my  head is protecting itself from them, then how could I trust myself. How can I trust what I think or feel at a given time because it might not be real, it might just be a smokescreen thrown up by a part of my head that thinks it knows better. Can I ever trust even simple things like I do like that movie or I don't like that show. These questions are the wind that blows up from the abyss, dark and cold as I stand there looking at it and feeling nothing. 

I don't know if this even makes any sense to anyone else. Maybe I am truly losing it right now. I don't even know if I feel bad right now.

HI
The "" I am anxiety' add hits it on the head. Well done. Now I am hoping that "" I am depression' and "" I am bipolar will follow.
Unless people will see/comprehend  how it feels having those illnesses people wont go to the docs.
I only went after stumbling on BB's website realising that I am sick......

Hi All,It was about six months ago now when my ""breakdown"" occurred. It coincided with the end of a long term relationship with a woman I share I child with. The last 12 months of the relationship I watched her cheat on me with six different men. The breakdown for me felt like a three day whirlwind spiral to absolute incompetence. A blubbering mess crying non-stop for three days straight struggling to remember what had happened the day before. I went to my Doctor who rushed me into a Psychologist who immediately called in the Mental Health team.I've been to the Doctors, I am on the medication. Talking didn't help me. I'm an educated guy, I have a Degree, when I tell the Psychologist something I can almost predict what she is going to feed back to me. I know the answers, surround yourself in friends and family, take it one day at a time, you've come so far. I'm 28, I've worked full-time and studied a full-time load pretty much through my entire 20s and now have the job I always dreamed of. Except it's exhausting, not the job ... the facade I put on each and every day to make it look like I actually care. The Doctors told me at the time of my ""breakdown"" that they were: ""almost certain it's reactive depression as a result of the relationship breakup, that people with clinical depression are unable to be happy even though they have financial security, good jobs, healthy children etc"". I have all of those things... yet ...I'm sure I am preaching to the choir here, it's just exhausting.

Hi all
i think I was about to go for my appt to see the Acute Team Pysch when I past wrote. He turned out to be yeRs young & arrogant. I think I was more self aware than he was used to so he tried to criticise the meds I'm on but then saying he can't sdp, change or recommend anything-as long as I went suicidal he was going to ph & refer me bk to my own private pysch. I was supposed to see her last Thursday but I hadn't slept for 41 hours & I couldn't go-I couldn't think straight & I knew I needed to be able to lake things in when I saw her. So now I have appt for mon 10 Feb but cancellations usually come up so I should see her this week. Several people have said just to stop taking the stimulant med as it's been a drastic decline last 2 wks. This wkend meant to be going down coast to stay for my husbands friends wedding. But as I keep telling him I'm not in a state to go to a wedding with no one I know & I'm not even looking forward to going away as home is my safety net comfort zone. My mind & thoughts are scattered, I can't concentrate or remember things. Even my mum is saying I don't talk like me-I'm unclear, finding communication difficult. She is concerned at my mental state as she's never seen me so unwell. She says to just tell my husband I can't go-he can still go, but he'd be so mad at me. I'm just feeling alone & had hoped to have advice/changes by now. But I may try lower dosages of the stimulant because someone like me who is generally always anxious-what benefit for me is there in taking a stimulant. Anxious, down, lost & feeling it's all too overwhelming. Anyway to sum up I feel awful. Exhausted beyond words. So my dear friends I'm wondering how you all are & I carry you in my heart. Lve Mares x

Thank you for opening my post.I'm 20, female and living in SA with my mother. I have depression, severe anxiety and agoraphobia. I've become very numb, not because of my medications but because of my mind. I can feel my body is physically reacting more than ever now and it scares me. I have a wonderful boyfriend but I can't even go on a date with him because I get too scared leading up to leaving the house and if I do leave, the whole time I can't stop looking over my shoulder and looking around and my heart rate goes crazy and I can't think, can't get comfortable, and I don't want anybody to see me or look at me.  Today for the first time in 8 months I went out and had coffee at a coffee shop with a good friend of mine, who knew I had these disorders. I tried my hardest to calm myself down and be relaxed and the best I could do was seem stressed, it was awful for me inside myself though, and leading up to knowing I was going to do this was awful.  My friend hadn't seen me like this before because I only see her at my house or hers, inside small spaces, a familiar safe area.  Once she saw I wasn't my normal self she started treating me different, and got very annoyed that I wasn't my usual self.  She wouldn't smile or make conversation with me and it made me feel so guilty and horrible and alone.  I tried to explain to her again what having agoraphobia means and she just seemed really put out, I even apologised for my condition to try and make her feel okay and she just laughed.   I am very saddened by this experience. When I got home I laid in bed like I always do and thought about hurting myself but I felt so heavy I couldn't move. I fell asleep, like I always do, and then woke up, and lay here, like I always do.   If you have read this far, thank you.Yesterday my dad got in contact with me and said he's leaving for england on sunday and won't be back for two years.  He's given me an hour to see him on saturday before he leaves. I never see him, I miss him, but he doesn't care about me.  Even my mother and my sister tell me this.  What if he dies while he's away? Tomorrow is the last few minutes I might ever spend with him.   I'm sad.

Lately I just feel down all to often. I have friends and family that love me, but I always just feel so alone. I am a nurse so my job  involves constantly caring for people and I love it but it just get so exhausting. When I get home all I want to do is sleep so I do, but then in never get to see my friends so this causes me to get even more down. I just don't know what to do! Especially when there is no one to care for me when I get home.

Hey guys, I've been in a really bad place lately, and I don't have anyone else to speak to, I don't want my family to know about my troubles, because there is already too much going on in my parents lives.
Where do i start? I've never spoken/written what's going on in my head before, and I just need to let it all out.
I've been the social outcast all my life, floating by on a piece of string, hoping it doesn't snap and leave me in the dark.
I don't have any friends, I have acquaintances who occasionally ask me to do stuff, but I am to afraid of going out, as I have sever anxiety issues and freak out about lots of things.
I guess my life spiraled out of control in the start of Year 10, toward the end of that year, the group of guys I hung out with at school stopped talking to me, avoiding me at all costs and just being really rude. 
I thought these were the people I could count on most to not do this.
For 3 months Oct-Dec, I spent every recess and lunch reading books alone, bottling up my feelings and hating myself, always wondering what I had done to deserve this.
I cried myself to sleep every night, as a 16 year old boy.
The school I attended finishes at Year 10, so I moved on to a new school..
New school, new start? yeah, right.
I'm a really shy person, I have the social skills equivalent to that of a polar bear, ( a.k.a non-existent )
I didn't meet new people, I struggled through school, year 12 was a shamble, with my anxiety causing me to blank out during tests and even pass out during exams, so on top of my failing life, my grades were miserable.
Of course, this made me feel even worse, no friends, no future aspirations, just a person no one cares about.
In October last year, at my cousins 21st, I met this wonderful girl, and we started talking, just a little at first, it eventually led on to us talking every night for 2 months until one of us fell asleep.
That 2 months was the best of my life. I forgot all the terrible stuff that had happened, and could only focus on the girl who made me feel alive.
I finally caught up with her, and it was a disaster, my stress levels went through the roof, and I messed up.
We didn't speak for a while, mainly because I was too afraid of what she thought.
A few nights ago, I messaged her, asking her if things could go back to the way they were before I was an idiot and my anxiety ruined our friendship.
She replied with a long drawn out message about how she was sorry about what we had, and she should never have talked to me as often as she did, and the way she did, knowing that I was a loner, and had never had a friend who was a girl. 
She basically led me on an adventure that ended in pain and suffering. One that I was all too familiar with.
I'm currently 18, most people think I have plenty of time to find someone like her, but I don't know, I've never had so much in common with anyone before, and the way she stopped talking to me literally crushed me.
I've spent the last few days ignoring her, the world and everything, I just feel like leaving. Permanantly
I don't really have anywhere else to go, except where everyone who goes through these things converges, I just want some people to talk to.

I want to go see a therapist, but i'm too afraid of my parents and siblings knowing, and trying to help me themselves, i'm too much of a burden on everyone.

Hi everyone, I'm having ex-boyfriend troubles. Thank you for taking the time to read my story, any advice is helpful.
 
My ex-boyfriend and I were together for nearly two years, living together and building a house together. We had issues, but both agreed that it was probably because neither of us had any space due to our tiny apartment and the fact we work together - familiarity breeds contempt. That is why we began building, so that we could be fully independent and still have some space. He was seeing a therapist through work due to his inability to control his temper (never violent but unable to control his emotions) and I felt it was really helping him, and we were both longing for our lease to end so that we could get a bigger place and not be in each others face so much until the house was built. 
 
Then he broke up with me suddenly nearly two months ago and it devastated me. Since then it's been back and forth emotionally. For a week after he said we had broken up he was helping me pack the apartment (our lease had ended) and we would talk and hug and spend the night together, even though he kept saying he still wanted to break up. I hoped that a few weeks apart would help him get over the stress and we would reconcile, but he eventually said that he didn't love me, didn't want to deal with the stress of the house, and had no interest in reconciling. I was devastated but accepted his decision. 
 
A few weeks later he had to sign some papers in my office and ended up staying for three hours, telling me how much he missed me, that he was having such a hard time, and how upset he was that he had been afraid to talk to me about how he was feeling when we were together. We talked about our problems and I know that if we had talked about it when we were together, we might have resolved things. I confessed I did want us to try again, but that I was unsure if I could trust him - he admitted he wanted me back but didn't want to rush into things. We agreed not to make any hasty decisions and to take it slow, so when he kissed me and asked to come over I said no, I did want him to, but it was too much for one day. 
 
A few days later we talked and he told me that he hadn't meant any of the things he said, and that he only said it to make me happy and still had no interest in a relationship. I was very upset, as he had been the one to instigate the conversation about us and had seemed to happy and affectionate when we left. My mother pointed out he might have felt rejected, so a few days later I contacted him and we started to talk again. He confessed he was feeling really unsure, angry and frustrated, and then began talking about suicide. The only thing that held him back was how upset his family would be. I was very distressed by this and comforted him, saying I wanted to be there for him, even if we were not in a relationship. He admitted that I'm the only person he feels comfortable talking to, and he's stopped seeing his shrink, but that he doesn't want to hurt me, hates when I'm upset and doesn't want me to get my hopes up. He asked if we could go out on the weekend to see the progress on our house, as he can't face going there himself. I agreed.
 
However a few days later he said something had come up and he wouldn't be coming - he says that he's going out with friends but I asked if it was really because he couldn't deal with the house and he said maybe. I went to see him and we sat in his car and talked. He talked about suicide again and I tried to convince him that he needed to see a shrink to help him deal with everything. I said I felt like he was toying with my emotions but that I'm trying to be patient and understanding because I feel like he's just lashing out because hes hurt and confused.
 
 He got very upset and angry, to the point where he was smashing his fist on the console, and made me get out of the car before speeding off. I tried to contact him, afraid he was going to do something awful, but he just told me to go away, stop calling, and blocked my calls. For hours I tried calling off other phones, and texting, asking that he just respond that he was OK. He didn't, and I ended up calling his mother and asking her to check on him while I got in the car to drive out there, fearing the worst. Eventually he did get into contact, he had turned his phone on silent and gone to sleep, but it was a truly horrible afternoon. 
 
I don't know how to handle whats going on. He's told me I'm the only person he can talk to, and I ask why he's pushing me away and he doesn't know. His family has a history of mental illness, suicide and depression, and I've tried reaching out to them with my concerns but they just rebuff me. I am really worried about him and don't know what to do. He won't seek help, he suppresses how he's feeling around his friends, and keeps changing his mind about what he wants from me, and pushing me away. I so still hope for a reconciliation I'll admit, but know there was no chance while he was so upset, and he's said he thinks we're too far gone to fix things, and that he doesn't love me anymore. Nevertheless, I still want to be there for him, because I still care about him so much. I'm afraid that if I cut him off, he'll do something stupid. And there is a degree of selfishness, because I don't want to lose him either. I have shown him this website and asked him to look into it, but he wont.
 
Any advice would be appreciated. I'll probably show him this post because I think he does need help, and it might help to get some advice from the beyondblue community. Thank you for taking the time to read my story.

I met with my psychologist yesterday afternoon.  This is the first session I've had with her where i was able to speak properly about everything, without turning into a blubbering mess.  It was also the first session where I was able to look at my relationship with Tara objectively, without just ""wanting her back"" as i had for the previous 5-6 weeks.
She didnt say it in exact words, but she suggested that my depression may have been brought on by Tara and the way she had been treating me.  Over the last 6 months of our relationship, she convinced me to leave a job i loved and we had to relocate, when that job didnt work out she assured me there was enough in savings for me to resign and look for a new job.  All the savings money was in her name so i was left with no money and became a virtual hermit for 6 months as she kept making excuses to not put money into my account, and because we only had 1 car i was left with no transportation.  This had been happening (money stuff etc) for approximately 2 years before we made the move
Finding the stuff on the computer that showed me she had been cheating on me was the best thing that ever happened to me (as stupid as that sounds) as it allowed me to see her for what she really was.  Previous to that I was always of the opinion i was lucky to have her, she was better than me and i should be greatful.
She will blame me for my moods changing for our relationship breakdown, but i feel my depression and subsequent mood changes were brought on by her actions towards me, turning me into a prisoner in my own home.
The releif i have felt since knowing it was over has been undescribable, knowing its finished and being able to see everything how it really was.  My blossoming relationship with Katy is also a fantasic feeling helping feel better, but even without that, knowing that of my life is finished is pure relief.
Has that happened to anyone else, to have a person who you loved and lived with to bring the depression on with their actions?
Something i wrote last night, directed at Tara
You thought you won?
You left me a broken man
You left me with no money
You left me with no job
You left me with no car
You left me with no home
You left me alone
Did you win? NO
I have rebuilt myself, and I am now a better man
I have a job
I have money
I have a car
And I am now seeing a new lady, who, throughout our whole relationship, i always wondered ""what if""
Now i can discover what if with her
So thank you for breaking me and causing me to rebuild myself, because i am now a better man than i was

A few hours ago I replied to those who had replied to my post (this is only my 2nd ever post), saying how I felt better today.
Since then, my son has returned back from his dad's house & has been saying things which strongly suggest he may be thinking of taking our son to live with him some time in the near future. We are not divorced (still separated) and there are no legal orders for access for either of us. I feel shattered, just shaken to the core. I never thought I would have to deal with this as our separation was pretty amicable
We have been separated for 3 years & I have a new partner. We are due to move in together (with my son) next month.
My ex-husband, I have recently found out, now has a girlfriend and I think he may want our son to live with them later in the year.
I keep my son out of all the difficulties I have with his dad. I have never bad-mouthed his dad to him or asked him to keep anything from his dad, ever.
Our son would like to live with both of us, he says. I am worried that if I go for custody that my depression will be brought up & also the state of my home, which needs a lot of repair & frequently looks like a bomb's hit it!
I feel panicky, like my world is starting to crumble around me. If I didn't have my son, I don't know what there would be left to live for.
After having done all the hard yards for the past 3 years looking after our son, I feel shattered that his dad might just come along & take him.
I can't even think straight as to what to do. I feel almost numb with shock at this. My son is my world & I just can't lose him.
Can these post be made available to solicitors etc...  I don't want to give anyone any ammunition against me.

Hi all, I was about to reply to my dear friend Neil when I realised there was a common thread through many people's stories & situations. So many of experience low Selfesteem, lack of confidence, fear of future, feel like a failure. And for some people the way they cope is to use avoidance strategies to escape the pain & experiences they are dealing with. For so long I have used avoidance behaviour whenever I could to cope. This may be taking extra medication, drinking, escaping into another situation etc. but I just thought I'd mention it as its a big part of depression. And when we cannot feel hope, we do the next best thing-try to escape the situation (& this includes harm issues). I don't have the answered & right now I wish I could escape/avoid how I'm feeling-but in my situation the depression has overwhelmed me beyond my usual point of hiding it & coping with it. But I have always had low Selfesteem, I have always blamed myself for anything & everything. I apologise for things that people say ""why are you apologising?), I see myself as a failure with no hope. Yet 10yrs ago I was in a high level job & was a different person. Now escaping into work was also an avoidance issue in some ways as I excelled at work but had experienced post-natal depression so I thought my kids were better in daycare. But they weren't happy & missed me & I eventually gave up work to be there for them and I'm so glad I did-yet the isolation when there is no one around is hard to manage. And from the reading I've done of people's stories-there seems to be an initial trigger or memory of painful experience from the past that they are still dealing with, as well as current issues which collide & bring us down. We may not even be able to identify the trigger/issue of pain as we have buried it deep & are now just coping with symptoms like me rather than moving on tie taking the next step of confronting or facing painful feelings, memories & thoughts. I don't know if any of this makes sense. I started off thinking of Neil & then thought so many of us may experience feeling at the bottom of the world. So this thread is ""dedicated"" to  Neil  ( im so awful hey) for those who can relate to the issues I've raised. Lve Mares x

Hi aallI was supposed to see a Pyschiatrist at the local hospital yesterday as part of the acute team. But my taxi never turned up & the Dr couldn't wait so now I have to wait to see him next week.I am extremely low, still struggling with overwhelming thoughts of  survival. My husband who had stayed working in NZ last week came home Thursday night. He usually works at home Friday but yesterday he went into work. He is returning to NZ tomorrow for another week. He really doesn't understand. He is asking me things like what will be for dinner each night-I can't even think of dinner. I'm trying to cope in half hour blocks.I don't know & I'm worried how to organise the kids for school this week. And next weekend my husband and I are meant to be staying down South Coast for a wedding. He seems to think I can just go back to feeling normal whenever I'm needed. But I can't. And I almost wish to go to hospital to have a break to get support for me. But that won't happen.I'm noticing I'm getting more anxious & afraid when I think of things I should have done ie pay bills & can't face anything at moment. Has anyone just had an acute reaction to depression that comes out of nowhere & takes over your thoughts & you can't identify a trigger? Because I've had depression & anxiety for years & usually I can tell I'm feeling low, know deep down what the triggers were & knew the type of support I needed. In such cases yes things may go by the wayside but I focus on something like reading which I usually love & I escape into that when I'm feeling low.But this time I can't concentrate to read, have zero interest in anything & feel so immobilised by my fear that I barely get through the day usually by reading on Beyond Blue.I cannot face people & couldn't imagine at all going out or doing anything I'd usually be able to do. I have also never previously considered hurting myself as my kids are everything to me, so they are a kind of safety net & I'd never ever do anything because I'd rather suffer through the depression than do something that would destroy them & I could never hurt them or leave them.Yet like the other things I've mentioned, this is the first time that my pain & out of control thoughts are stronger than my usual safety net (my kids).  It's the first time ever that the thoughts are stronger than my ability to survive for my kids. The out of control thoughts tell me they would be better off long term rather than having a mother in this state & my husband could meet someone else. That in itself is proof of my current state of mind. I'm not ""me"" at the moment.I really hope to see a psych ASAP. I'd be interested if anyone has ever had a similar  situation-where severe depression just comes from nowhere & you feel completely out of control of your thoughts & feel terrified by being out of control, especially the thoughts of not wanting to continue-existence issues. Any similar experiences would be appreciated.So to sum up-I'm in an awful place but I'm holding on by reminding myself next week will hopefully provide more support & some changes in treatment-therefore helping me out of the current situation. I can't say thank you enough for reading, replying & being my main support at this time. My heart goes out to all experiencing a difficult time-you remain in my thoughts.

It's January 27 2014 and the time is 1.30pm. As i sit on my bed listening to music, i think about how all of us here at BB have come together to give a Helping Hand to each of us.
We have all come from many different backgrounds, had many different ups and downs in our lives but there is one thing we all have in common that is we are seeking help and guidence to overcome our mental illnesses. We offer advice, support and encouragement to each and everyone of us, to lift us up of the ground and to give us a helping hand when we are in need of someone willing to offer their hand in our time of need.
As we get pulled up of the ground by each of us, we say thankyou and give that person a hug. That person is also willing to offer their shoulder to have a cry on, an ear to listen to us and a mouth to voice support and encouragement.
To each and everyone of you i say: THANKYOU, I HAVE FAITH IN YOU, I BELIEVE IN YOU, I ENCOURAGE YOU, BE STRONG, BE DEFIANT AND STAND TALL. We will all make it and that it will be ok.
To Beyond Blue: From the bottom of my heart THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ONGOING SUPPORT TO EACH OF US. I think all of us should give Beyond Blue a big round of applause for the advice, support and encouragement they have all given and continue to give us all.
Kind Regards
Chris

For the past week I've spent a lot of time in bed, I don't ever really feel like leaving. I've cancelled plans with friends, experienced anxiety over having to go to work and I feel pretty numb most of the day.
I've got a great doctor, fantastic psychologist and a big support system yet I'm scared of everything, everyone. I try to focus on getting better but is it common to experience massive lows like this while seeking help?
I'm just so tired, so anxious, so completely over feeling so distant from the rest of the world.

I feel Im almost at a point to go to hospital. Ive already seen a psych, plus a mental health nurse and they both think itd be worse for me if I was to go in there, and worse for me to change meds. How can this be? What is supposed to help? Im getting worse. I cant see a way out of whats happening. My life cannot go on with the same thought patterns, or loneliness, or poverty, so Its supposed to be ok for me to just stay in this mental space? Im just supposed to live a comprimised half life forever? Thats all there is for me?

HI
I have read many posts and where people were wondering how the 'real me' feels. With me I can tell the difference in my solar plexus( the area behind your breastbone).The real me, my soul is there, the real me lives there.
If depression/anxiety takes hold that area hurts, it crushes my chest and I cant 'be'.I want to run, die, or cut the feeling out.
The med manages to take that feeling away and replaces it with a positive warm feeling.
I know the real me is the positive warm feeling since I did experience this feeling before-but only randomly since my mental health was 'suboptimal' and I was down in the dumps.
So I believe there is only one real me- that one which can only exist with the med. So the real me was always there, and is still there, but the depression/anxiety suffocated those warm positive feelings and I could therefore never feel the real me. So now I can at least feel and am grateful for that. I lack the negative feelings which I don't miss. 
Sorry this post probably doesn't make any sense-but I thought it may help people to learn feeling again.
My compass for the state of my mental health is my solar plexus. Its good to be able to feel that part again and not wanting to cut it out of my chest!

I Have found myself in my garage numerous times writing letters to my family and friends apologising for everything i  have done and how i want to end it......I have tried twice but failed and i just feel even more depressed because i can not do it.   I see a picture of my ex and it just destroys me because i know i single handedly destroyed our relationship and took it for granted.  I love her so much.  I know i can make her happy again and i just want that chance.I ruined my relationship with my sick brother and i wasn't there for him when he got sick. I wish i could turn back time. I just want to be happy...I scared and alone..... Sorry   'beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I have recently been diagnosed
with depression. I think that deep down I always knew that, but hearing someone
else say it really shook me. It was a difficult journey to announce that I had
a problem, to be precise it took me four years. No one around me knew that
there was this inner turmoil going on within me. Neither my friends nor my
family.
  
My mother was shocked and so
saddened, when my school counselor told her I had a problem, she was visibly
unnerved by the unexpected events. She held me in her arms and asked me why I
felt this way. I didn't know how to answer her because I wasn't even sure of
the root of my problem myself.
  
We cried and I took a couple of
days off school so that we could go see our GP. He recommended we go see a
psychiatrist and he gave us all the relevant information that we needed. I had
to wait a month before I got to see him.
  
Our first session was of me practically
telling him all the things I have been going through. Generally the things that
I have been unable to say out loud to people before. That first session
left me in tears due to confronting my suicide attempts, feeling of worthlessness
and incompetence, and the black pitch of darkness that was loneliness.
 
  
We have yet come to a
conclusion as to why I am like this, but I am afraid that I have come to a
deduction myself. And what I think is the root of my depression is not
something I am happy to admit.
 
  
The reason for my depression
is my mother.
 
  
When she held me in her arms
and ask me why I am feeling depressed, she asked me whether it was due to her.
At that time she was already sobbing. So I took her into my own arms and told
her that it wasn’t.
 
 
I think that the reason I
didn’t say anything at the time was because she was so anguished already, I didn’t
want to upset her anymore.
 
 
My mother can be a rather
terrifying person. When she is angry, for some reason I am so scared for my
life.
 
  
She has never been violent to
me, but for some reason when she is angry I am so scared. The basic
relationship of a mother and daughter should not be like this, yet this is how
it is for me. Our relationship dynamic consists of her being angry and me being
submissive and cowering away in silence until she has calmed down enough so
that I can apologise to her without angering her further.
 
 
Don’t think that she is a bad
person. She is a good mother and when she is not angry she is a great friend. A
lovely woman who is tough, strong, funny, sweet, beautiful and capable.
 
  
But then why am I so terrified
of her?
 
  
Depressed and Disheartened

Hi People out there in cyberspace,I'm hoping that sharing this with you will help me come to terms with my psychological problems. It's hard to talk to people in person about the craziness in your head. The thing that sucks the most is I KNOW that I have nothing to be depressed /anxious about. You know, the standard first world problems type of disorder: I have a house, partner, am an engineer, fit, good family, friends, awesome dog.I'm an almost 30yo f, who has just had a major depressive episode, where I did some pretty stupid things. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for 18 years with varying degrees of success. I'm successful in my job (apparently) however, just recently I noticed all those symptoms coming back, the self doubt, loathing, hatred, anger, frustration and crying. I didn't act on the symptoms 6-8 weeks ago and then they just progressively got worse.I am currently working away, which is a pressure cooker environment, and in a nutshell, I had a few drinks, got into a massive argument with someone, ended up in tears and then ended up self harming because it seemed like a good thing to do at the time. So.... now I have had to take time off work, to pretty much try to sort out my head again. The embarrassment, shame, guilt and additional self loathing of being such a nut case is even more depressing and just frustrating. I'm so concerned that I have totally wrecked my career and I am dreading returning to work, because I know that I'm definitely a nutcase and how am I going to cope with having to show my face there again?i want to know if anyone else ever gets tired of working on their mental health? Does it wear you down to the point where sometimes you just slip back into bad habits, because sometimes you are just too tired, or can't be bothered? I also want to know if anyone else here has violent fits of uncontrollable crying or urges to hit something? Sometimes I want to hurt myself so that I won't feel anything. How do I cope going back to work? And trying to repair the damage that I have done?I'm starting to realise that this is a lifelong condition for me, and I'll always have to filter and work on my thinking. It's a scary thought.So the other thing is I know I'm doing all the right things now, seen my GP and had my meds adjusted, got a new MHCP, booked in to see the psych.What I hate most is that there are people out there, including people on here, who are suffering from far more tragic circumstances, wether it be relationships, hardship, bullying, family issues or health problems, and yet I sit here with no perceptible problems apart from self inflicted misery.Ginger ninja.

So dear Jo asked how I was but I felt bad about taking over her thread. I would have posted on ymy old thread except I promised I would start a new one. Even if today is far from good, I wanted to live up to some promise I made. 

I'm not good today. I am
feeling like breaking down due to pressures from my favourite pressure
points that I haven't dealt with this past year and I am torn about what
to do about it. I want to practice the techniques my psych taugh tme but the monsters are resisiting hard today. Every moment that I don't do them just gives them more strength. That leads to more indecision and...well.  This leads to a vicous
cycle of thoughts I am trapped in at the moment.  Add to that there is housework I should have done but haven't and despite sleeping all day after being sleep deprived, I am still exhausted. If I crawl into bed I will be giving up on getting anything done which is tossing another steak to my monsters. At the same time I don't know if I can do any good not in bed. 

I can't breakdown though because I am worried about my friend who is extremely ill right now and
my husband is not doing great. So I am going to keep an eye on
him tonight and take him to the doctors tomorrow. Other people need me to be strong, to be here and present so I am. It all feels like a layer of ice though, underneath which is a heaving ocean. 

I am tossed around by all these emotions and thoughts. They all feel so real. At the same time all I can think is that right now my good friend is fasting for a life threatening operation to remove a tumour. She has all these real problems and I'm sitting here unable to get up and do the dishes because I'm to weak to even do that. I just keep thinking that if there is any power in the universe, to take the sickness from her. She is such a lovely person, she doesn't deserve what she is going through right now. Give it to me, if someone has to get sick, to die. I'll take it. Just leave her be.

None of this I'd feel right about saying out loud. Like I said, I have to be strong for her. I feel it though. Then I feel bad for feeling it, i feel bad for feeling bad...

Vicous circles and all that. 

So yeah, I'm not conflicted and not good today.

Hello
I am new here. Decided to join as I am feeling a bit alone with this illness at the moment.
I have struggled with depression for many, many years and have been taking medication for it for the past 10 years, which has enabled me to keep on living, but not necessarily happily.
I am currently on a month's annual leave, and have 2 weeks of it left. This week I have been feeling very flat & have been having persecutory dreams. This is probably in anticipation of having to return to the 'daily grind' soon, which I dread.
I have some good things happening in my life at the moment as well, but I don't seem to be able to feel the happiness that these things usually bring. I find that I rarely feel happiness about anything. I feel trapped in this life.
It would be good to hear how other people obtain contentedness in their lives.
Regards,
Christa1

I thought I would give this a go since I have nobody to talk
to and I feel as though nobody understands. A few years ago I have found out that I have mixed depression. I always
thought it was my normal behavior to get upset, have thoughts about suicide
etc.
My father left when I was 5 and has never really been there.
Some say he never should of had children. My mother replaced him with a man
only weeks after being separated who abused me. I tried to tell my mother and
she accused me of lying. I was abused for over 10 years until he went to lay a
hand on my mother. My father was never really there and my mother moved us to a
different state so we would be further away from him.
In my teenage years I rebelled as I was not allowed to do
anything, so I did it. I was constantly drunk, on drugs and having sex with
boys. But years later I have left this bad behavior behind. I don’t drink alcohol,
don’t smoke and definitely don’t touch drugs.

Some of my family members found out about my depression and
anxiety and have told me just to get over it. Nobody knows how it feels to be
abused unless you have been though it and one does not simply get over it even
if the person is now deceased

I have seen several psychologists which I feel
don't do much, I have tried anti depressants and to be honest make me
feel even crazier than I am and I cant drive my car on them.
I have a loving partner who I have been with for over a year
and two puppies. We have moved 1300 kms away from friends and family leaving me
quite isolated. My partner works in mining and works away for two weeks at a
time. I would like to meet people but I am not into joining clubs and things as
I have anxiety and hate being out of my comfort zone so I work and relax at
home.
My partner also suffers from depression after losing a house
to his previous girlfriend and also being in a lot of debt. Due to his
depression he is unable to get an erection and will not seek help for this. We haven’t
had sex in over 6 months which is somewhat frustrating and causes our only
arguments from.

From working two
weeks straight my partner is always extremely tired when he arrives home.
Sometimes too tired even to kiss me or talk to me causing me to feel unloved

I would love some advice on how to deal with these issues

Thanks for listening

Hi,
I have recently been diagnosed with depression and I was hoping to reach out to others that may be able to offer advice or strategies.
Through discussions with my GP, I have come to realise that my depression is most likely linked directly to my social anxiety and OCD. I am struggling to fathom these ""labels"" that I have been given because up until now I always believed it was my personality to be neat and tidy (not a compulsion), and that I was simply going through some rough patches. However after a bit of soul searching it occurred to me that I have probably been suffering from depression and anxiety for quite some time but I never cared to admit it out loud.
I am booked in to see my GP again and get a referral to a psychologist. I am looking at this being the first step in dealing with my issues.
I have begun taking St.Johns Wort - a natural herb used to help subdue symptoms of low mood and anxiety. I was wondering if any of you have taken this and noticed significant change in mood over time? I am hesitant to take clinical medication for fear of not being able to come off it - also my partner is loathed to me taking such medication so unfortunately I don't have support there.
I have also been self-medicating for many years, particularly in social situations, to calm my nerves. I have never used anything stronger than alcohol, but now I have become dependent on it to help me loosen up. Can anyone offer any strategies to help me become calm in unfamiliar social situations without alcohol?
I am struggling to think that depression and anxiety are my lot in life. It is difficult for a perfectionist like me to comprehend that my perfectionism is sucking me into a deep, dark hole. I am positive that I can climb my way back out but certain that I cannot do it alone.
I hope you can help.

So today I had an appt with my GP so he could make sure I was okay.  Well I wasn't okay. He said he cares about me and wants to see me happy again and not in this state.  He said he would be very hurt if i did something to myself. I was sitting there, head down not really paying attention to what he was saying. I don't care anymore.  I told him I had a plan and we talked about it and now he wants me to see a psychiatrist. And i said no because i don't want to talk about the same stuff over and over again. And then he'll probably give me more medication which i don't want.I told him why can't he just send me away somewhere and he said I am not at that point of being admitted into hospital. But he wants me to see someone.  I told him i can't because then i will lose my therapist and i don't want to lose him as i am comfortable with him.  But actually last night in session we talked about how bad i thought my depression is and he said i probably should see a psychiatrist as well.  Can i see a psych for one visit or do i have to keep going back and now with less hours at work which means less money i don't think i can afford seeing a psych.What are they going to do anyway? I'm not in a very good frame of mind at the moment, my GP wants me to stay busy all weekend and I have to go back on Tuesday to see him.  My GP said that my husband is at fault to a point because he doesn't want to acknowledge my depression and doesn't speak to me about it.  I know he wants it all to be perfect but it's not perfect.So that was my day today, I am exhausted and fragile at the same time. These thoughts are horrible.Jo

Hi people,
so, this is my 4th day not working and at home... I'm freaking out because I have not stopped sleeping... 
Each morning, I resolve to myself that I'm going to go do something. Walk, run, swim...leave the damn house. So today, I managed to leave the house... To go to the pharmacy to get my scripts refilled... (I don't think that even counts as it is a 2 min drive) 
i also forced myself to have a shower after 3 days of no showers... Is that extra bonus points? 
Anyway, so my first question is: my meds have been adjusted (dosage increased) back to something I have been on previously. I don't know if I'm feeling better, but I do know that I'm feeling crazy lethargic... And sleeping... A lot.... Is that normal? Dizziness... Been feeling so dizzy, but maybe that's just because I have been spending so much time horizontal... (Not in the fun way). Fuzziness...i feel fuzzy, like my whole brain is fuzzy, as if I haven't brushed it with a toothbrush and minty fresh paste for a few days.  Do you guys get the same thing after medication adjustment?
My Second one is: in an attempt to 'do' something, I thought my SO and I could start on planning the kitchen (probably slightly ambitious). 5 minutes in, I was already irritated and annoyed at him... For no reason. So he's being supportive, trying not to ask too many questions, sitting in silence, but his presence is starting to annoy me... I want him to go out, do something and leave me alone (selfish I know). 
If I'm getting irritated by my SO who 'understands', I'm going to last about 5 minutes against my work colleagues who are about 1000000000000 times more insufferable. 
Anyway, this is more of a vent than anything else... But if you've got ideas on the medication thing, drop me a line. I don't really recall having too many probs with side effects before, but then again, I never can remember clearly what it's like from episode to episode.

Dear allThankyou so much to those who replied to me in my last post-Kate & 'Alone & Scared"" thanks for being there at the right time.Jo-I know your overwhelmed so thank you so much-your also a special friend.That leaves Geoff & Neil. Geoff-I can't thank you enough for your support, wisdom, insight & advice. I've wanted to say that to you for ages but it was never an appropriate time. You are a core member of BB who consistently welcomes & responds to others. I admire you so much & I thank you for all you do. You are inspirational in your generosity. I would love to kknow how you managed to live with depression/PTSD/anxiety as they are what I seriously struggle with. But I understand that's your personal journey & in no way do I want to intrude.That leaves me with a reference to Neil-as you mentioned Geoff, he is going through a difficult time & I am guessing there are many other issues he has to deal with that we are unaware of. I was thinking of him this morning & how many people he replies to & offers support-I may be completely wrong-but I do wonder if by filling his time with other people's problems that he then has no time to confront his own issues.He is brilliant at supporting & advising others, but perhaps it's time to look after his well being first. I have such fondness for him & have left mags for him in his last two posts which I hope he gets. I really wish we could talk on phone or email or something. I know I'll be thinking of Neil all day & it's hard when the forum is a slow place for reading, receiving & posting messages. But yet the forum is brilliant as its probably the most advanced method of communication re mental health.As for me, the acute team want me to see a Registrar Pyschiatrist at a public hospital tomorrow. Has anyone had any experience with psychs in public hospitals? I'm a bit worried I'm going from the frying pan (my private pysch) to the fire (public mental health system).I have asked that my private pysch & GP not be informed of the present situation as I want the space to explore options without feeling guilty. The acute team said they will find out if it has to be disclosed.My husband  has his narrow mind determined that the sole problem is being caused by the use of one medication I started nearly 4 was ago. And has said to me ""he is sick & tired of trying to help me as I don't take his advice"" -meaning not take the prescribed medication. But whilst I & the acute team agree I need a medication review-they also said that no medication would cause my current state of mind four weeks after I started it. If I was to react this badly it would have happened at the start or early stages ie first week of me taking the medication.And the acute team were shocked he had left me with kids in this state-when I spoke to him last night to ask him to please read a little bit about depression, his reply was that I could harm myself whether he was here or not so what was the point of taking time off work to come home when I was in this state-he said he couldn't do anything to fix it so he was angry the acute team thought he should be with me at this time.He barely reacted to the acute team coming (even though he has previously trained in social work) which surprised me as before he left I asked him are there any services that can come to your house? And his reply was that mental health services are so under resourced that acute teams are only for people who are either seriously ill with conditions such as Schitzophenia or people who are seriously ill.He immediately followed that statement by saying 'there's no way an acute team would ever visit someone like you, you aren't unwell enough"". So off he went to NZ telling me I'd be fine & that the only thing he would finally say on the matter was "" you know what I think & you've chosen to ignore my advice so there's nothing more I can say or do about the situation""- he was referring to his ""advice"" to stop the stimulant medication.I don't know if its just me being negative but it hurt that the only reason he saw for coming home was because of safety issues & he thought harm could occur whether he was here or not. But what stood out to me was that he hadn't considered coming home in terms of providing care, compassion & loving support. He hadn't considered that being with me would be a natural thing to do when your partner is seriously ill. He hadn't thought that being here would provide me with company, support, compassion & make me feel loved & reassured.I guess it was like a complete lack of emotion in response to my situation & that hurt. He is home tonight (Thursday) & goes back to NZ on Sunday. In some ways given his response to what I'm going through-I am feeling anxious about him coming home for a few days & would now really prefer he didn't. As whilst he is here he will criticise me for not following his advice, he will make comments such as ""he is completely over this situation) & he will not talk WITH me, he will talk at me & I get very anxious when he is in that frame of mind & given how fragile I am now, the last thing I need or want is he tring to intervene & overtake things-for example when I go to visit pysch tomorrow I'm sure he will want to tell his opinion.Oh-update-he just phoned & said why are you going to see a pyschiatrist at the hospital-psychs that work in public health are hopeless. Great support-just what I needed to hear. Things are really hard, I'm just managing to get through each day & now I'm going to have to deal with him. Anxious just thinking about him.Je is due at 5pm tonight. I will be very anxious. Does anyone have any advice or knowledge or experience of Pyschiatrists on an Acute Mental Health team?Thanks x Mares x

Well just got back from court
She arrived with a guy this morning, so no idea what that means...but then a girl arrived a little later
We sat around for hours (case was heard at 12:45, we arrived at court at 8:30)
My lawyer got her to agree to a 6 month order with just her listed - NOT the children, so that is a win at least, but i guess i know her feelings towards me, and at least i can feel free to pursue Katy (or someone else) now - without any admission of guilt from me
So i will still have access to the kids, but will only be on weekends...we have to arrange some sort of mediation to get an agreement in place
Now i have to go back to my lawyer to get some of our savings money back so i can set myself up (dont want to continue living with my mum) and to put our house on the market, i am not letting her just keep everything we worked for together - i worked some horrible jobs so we could buy that house....now i have to start all over again

Ok, this one for all the Harry potter fans...
The Dementors from Harry Potter, are based on JK Rowlings experience of depression. 
Makes a lot of sense, they suck away all sense of happiness, shroud you in a black fog, and bring out all of your deepest darkest thoughts.... Plus they guard the jail - it's like you are locked up in your own personal cell...
So, now I wish I could run around yelling ""Expecto Patronum"" and have a cool Patronus of my dog run around and banish my personal Dementors away... All I need is a happy thought, a wand and lots of courage.
The crap you find on the net when you are wasting time trying not to feel anything....*sigh*

Hi all
this has not been a good week. Iam in such emotional turmoil that my body aches and I'm in physical pain all the time, which I can't explain and I feel crazy because of it.
i understand your advised to not do this alone however the doctors I haven't found helpful because I don't speak, I write better then I speak in most cases it allows me to properly say what I'm thinking. 
ive become irrationally afraid of things such as the dark and being alone. I was a very independent person however my anxiety an depression is terrifying me and I'm petrified to be alone at the moment, not with fear I will  do something more because I'm terrified I won't be able to stop a panic attack once it takes over my body. I've foundry self angry that no one in my life understand my circumstances, as I'm so proud I have only told a select few to assist with my recovery and I'm uncontrollably angry they don't understand and I feel like because I told them they need to fix it because I feel so helpless that I can't. It's taking over my entire existence 
i never thought I would be a person to speak out  I feel like I'm doing something wrong but at the same time it's as though a weight is lifted temporarily

I have so much I am grateful for, an amazing partner, a gorgeous daughter, we don't have much money but it's enough to put food on the table, a roof over our head and the most basic of other needs, parents who would do anything for me at the drop of a hat. Despite all this, I am living a life of self loathing and depression. Unmedicated by choice (I have reasons that I wish not to discuss and talking me Into medication will be hard). I look in the mirror and hate what I see, I only get up in the morning because of my daughter who isn't even one yet. My partner is as supportive as he can be given he has depression too. I spend my days wanting to curl up in a ball, I feel worthless and useless,I refuse to ask for any help around the house and I don't know why, I prepare food and look after everyone else coz I want to but I don't remember the last time I ate anything before 4pm, all I want to do I change my look and run away but I have a child now....I say and do things that make my partner angry, maybe to get a rise out of him, I don't know. I apologize for things that didn't even involve me, but could have. I have pushed all my friends away. I saw a psychologist for a few months but felt it wasn't doing any good, I plan on going back once I get another referral from my doctor who returns from a working holiday soon. I don't know why I posted, I guess I just feel lost, I need a way to at least like me, a starting point. I'm sorry about my little rant, I just needed to say it... And sorry about the grammar, I'm usually not this bad... If I re read what I've written I won't post at all...

So this is my first time on an online forum so bare with me. I am currently in recovery of a 2 1/2 year period of depression and anxiety which in the last year induced psychosis. I am finally starting to feel better and more confident with the things that I do and am about to start a college course (I'm 17) and am trying to get a job and all that jazz, but I have this constant feeling of walking on eggshells. I'm absolutely terrified of relapsing, after stressful days I still have that craving to self-harm and on really bad days it is becoming very difficult to resist. I am really hesitant to tell my mum because I don't want to cause anymore damage to my family (this year with the psychosis has been really damaging to my relationship with my family and friends). I would talk to her about returning to therapy but I have really big trust issues with the facility I was getting treatment at after they misdiagnosed my condition for over a year. So my real question is does anyone have any tips or ideas on how to stop this eggshell feeling, as well as ideas on keeping the self-harm thoughts at bay? I've tried music and distractions but lately there not working as well. beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all, I just wrote a short post in my post called'Monsters in my head'. Then I realised I'm sitting here alone feeling almost too ashamed to come here & talk to you guys so I should do it. I am feeling incredibly low. I feel like I've been overtaken my misery, sadness, loss & feel like a hopeless failure. The past 2 nights I've gone to bed so relieved the day is over & hoping I won't wake up. When I wake in the morning I'm full of dread & fear & severe anxiety. As I mentioned, I could clearly write my own will the state I'm in. I'm so tired of the battles with this illness, the effects on my family & their responses to me. All I can see is a future spend struggling for other people & me not being active or happy during any of it. And it terrifies me the way depression can sometimes just overcome me & I don't know why. Like last week I was good & I managed to have a whole week at home by myself. When I was crying yesterday about how scared I was of these thoughts that seemed to be coming from nowhere & overwhelming me, I said to my husband what do I do when I get this low? And his reply was 'ring your pyschiatrist'. Now if I ring her in this state she will only be concerned about me & will probably suggest hospital or if I explain how I'm truly feeling she will admit me I think. She never has as she knows I have insight & my kids are my safety net. But if she did admit me my husband would flip out as he is travelling for work the next two weeks & we have no support to help us with kids or in a crisis. I feel like my heart is actually physically aching but I can only shed a few tears. Although if someone hit a trigger I'd probably cry for ages. I'm so over this struggle, I'm over having an illness that's still not socially acceptable in the general community. I'm tired of fighting the darkness, doing all the things that are supposed to help & ending up here. I'm only 40 & the last 10 years have just been one long battle with my illness & mu husbands leukaemia. I'm so genuinely frightened of the thoughts that are popping into my head. I'm so alone & desperate. I have a GP & Pysch who just prescribe medication. I feel like I'm drowning and I just want reassurance I won't drown or if I do that it's the best outcome.

Hi   
I feel washed out.   Feel so incredibly tired.  Yet I think that I get an appropriate amount of sleep.  I do dream every night and they range from some being ok ones to some not so flash ones.  Last night was one of the not so flash ones!  :(   
But this cycle just continues on and I’m sick of this.  The conveyor belt of life … on and on it goes, chug chug chug along … the same mundane, boring, monotonous journey, punctuated by the odd injury here and there.  And you know what else … I sit for the most part with a scowl or sorrow etched on my face.  It’s amazing, I can’t cry, but I can’t laugh either.  I used to be able too.  (Oh crap, I finished this message and was going to send, but started to re-read the damn thing and have started to add more stuff!  I’ll send this thing now!)  
 I don’t know what it is … I still go to the gym 5 days a week and the other two days I still do some kind of exercise, which is always of a late arve and I amazingly have energy and enthusiasm for that.   
My mornings of late are becoming a major struggle.  I do get up and get out of bed each day (yes, I know that’s a positive) and I do get to work.  I’m having less sick days than I used to during late last year;  but that’s only because my sick day credits are quite low.  I feel like I’m whining to you all and I HATE that.  
 I’m just so sick of all this.  My eyes just want to close and I think my body wants to do the same thing.  I’m getting worse as time goes by … and all I feel is that by me being this way it HAS to affect my family – my beloved kids and I don’t want them to see me like this and I don’t want them to possibly fall foul of this evil rotten disease.   
I go to my GP and he’s really caring, but at the end of it, he just asks, “What would you like me to do?”   
I go to my psychiatrist and at the end he says, “The best thing we can do is to get you a different or a new job.”  (But that’s so much easier said than done … the current job climate where I am is ‘below zero’ and little sign of it thawing out for a while yet.  So if one has a job, one has to hold onto it in order to get paid.  The dreaded money curse again.  But I had 9 months off last year and I’m back here again and it’s just doing my head in – the other people here – I think I’ve now developed some sort of phobia about them.  It’s not everyone – there’s just five of them – and they’re as cliquey a group as you can get … but it’s their voices that irritate me, their bangles that slap against the desk when they type … and they bag people out … mostly men and mostly their other halves.  Oh jeez, listen to me … whinge whinge, ***** *****!)  Not good Neil.  
 I do have my psychologist appointment coming up – don’t know if I’ve mentioned this before, but can you believe it;  of all the days it has to be on, it’s on the day at coincides with the day that I couldn’t save my brother and I lost him – lost him forever and from there, the family commenced its demise … due to yours truly.  But then again, as I’ve written before, my brother’s anniversary - 13th Feb - and Dad’s anniversary (what a stupid name association that is for the day that someone dies) – they don’t actually make me feel sadder – because I grieve for them everyday.  It’s a bit like the old Valentine’s Day syndrome … people go nutso because of a particular date and buy flowers, roses, presents etc … just because of a stupid date – why can’t you buy flowers, roses, presents, etc on ANY day during the year?  People have become so … sheep like I think.  I guess this is where I differ … at least I’m not sheep like.  My partner knows never to expect anything on Valentine’s Day, cause I go against the trend and I buy flowers, etc at different times throughout the year.  Much better that way … far more special … as it comes as a massive surprise as opposed to something they are going to expect.   
Oh shite – this was just meant to be a small post just to get some feelings down and to send it off, but I have this stupid thing in my brain that I cannot ever seem to post a short message.  I don’t know why, although I think I do … it’s a feeling of insecurity.  I’m insecure about everything about myself – it’s a weakness.  
All the time while typing this, I have very close to falling asleep and it’s what, 8:40am.  
 That’s it I guess … well actually, that’s not it … there’s so much more, I’ve barely touched the surface there, but for the moment, that’s it.   
Neil
ps:  thanx for reading, and special kudos if you got all the way through.

Hi all
tomorrow is my long awaited psych appointment and to say I am anxious is like saying it's just a tad warm!
OMG. I have been reading all your posts and find myself 1/ in awe of your inspiring messages and 2/ feeling crap that I complain about my petty issues.
So I thought I would run my plan of attack by you. I have set myself a list of goals I want to achieve this year, e.g stop meds lose weight,. accept my depression, etc I am going to ask my psych to help of course and the only condition is no emotional talk. Ok I know that sounds stupid but I am telling you I am so full of conflicting emotions all the time I can't cope.
Once we get started on the whys I just lose it. I don't know if I will ever really deal with my issues, but at least if I don't talk about them I can somehow muddle through. I just need to be told what to do and I will do it. Just get me from A to B. Is that too hard? 
Believe me if I go to doc tomorrow and talk to him like I've been talking to you guys, he will lock me up and throw away the key!
In fact if I was completely honest I don't think I've ever told him everything that I've been feeling, for exactly that reason. I am scared to be completely honest about my feelings in case I get locked up again. That's why this site is a good release. Sometimes you just have to have a rant and get it out there without thoughts of reprisals. ( in fairness I had an extensive history and gave plenty of reasons to admit me) .
So I will try and focus now and maybe add to my list ( number 55)
cheers

I am not doing as well as would like. After finishing year 11 and 12 through homeschooling my social phobia is even worse than it was when I dropped out of school in the first place. My family and my psychologist all think it would be a good idea for me to give university a go, as I do not have to do full time courses there so i can kind of gradually try and ease into feeling normal around people. I feel completely backwards and more depressed than I have been in a long time right now.
I recently got a nice job in November last year, which has helped me overcome a lot of my anxiety issues, however I constantly feel like i am under performing and that my boss and everyone else thinks I am a bit hopeless. I keep having dreams where I feel like I am trapped and which ever way i turn I am in some kind of highly stressful situation. And after my last shift I had managed to convince myself that I was fired because my anxiety was so bad, and I did not check the rosters. Today my manager rang me saying that I was supposed to be at work an hour ago. i do not know how i am supposed to get over this, and i know I will definitely be fired. I do not know who talk to about it either because my family and my psychologist are so proud of me for getting this job in the first place, and if I lose it they will be so disappointed in me. I have also started binge eating again. Not nearly as bad as it was when everything was really bad two years ago, but bad enough for me to feel absolutely terrible. 
The only person I feel comfortable about talking to about how I really feel is my psychologist, but I can only see her once every fortnight and that is a long time to go with out talking to anyone. Please help, I feel like I am already a complete failure of a person at 18, and even if I do go to university I am so scared that I will not make a single friend. I would really like to talk to someone my age who is going through something remotely similar.I am really sorry about writing all of this, I hope I was not over sharing.

Hi Guys
I have spent a lot of time on line the last couple of days as I am having a bad time. it is raining and I always find the rain makes me worse. I have been reading lots of your posts and have responded to some when I think I have something to offer. I was disappointed in the outcome of my appointment last Thursday, not to mention embarrassed and all my grand 'plans' seem unattainable- again!
.The truth is I need some help. I need to know is there anyone out there that shares my problem. I continue to self medicate despite being admitted to hospital several times for detox, and then finally getting off my opiates after an infusion in August.I know the dangers, I know I am not fooling myself with my reasons, most of which I don't get anyway.
  I told my psych I wanted to get off and although he knows everything about me he still says my drug use isn't the main problem , my depression is. He says the dosage of my meds isn't too high and he would rather I stay on AD and I can ween off my anxiety meds if I want.The thing is I don't know if I really want to . I say I do but I'm pretty quick to reach for a pill if I'm in pain, feeling down or as is today it is raining! What the ???
  I can't help feeling that the meds give me some level of control. I feel less anxious and usually very calm and out of it. I know I will never get my life back on track until I can give up these drugs but I am really struggling. I keep as busy as I can doing various things, but I know I am again addicted and I am really scared I will have to go back into hospital. 
 My husband would be devastated if this happened. I am only slowly regaining his trust after the last admission.    Is there anyone going through this? Please let me know

Hey Everyone.. First time I have ever been to a website like this. It's refreshing to see so many people in the same boat finding the support they need. 
I've been feeling different the past few months. Which is strange because nothing unusual or dramatic has occurred. I don't have any hobbies anymore because I don't enjoy them, everyday feels the same and it's an effort to get out of bed in the morning as I feel there isn't anything to look forward to.. It's almost a numb feeling, whether that's good, bad, or neither I don't know. Sleep has become pretty much non-existent. It takes me a long time to fall asleep and when I do it's not for long, constantly waking up in the middle of the night. I also get this sick feeling.. kind of like being nervous but it's constant.
I was just wondering how many other people have experienced this and if they found anyone/anyplace that helped. I have no idea where to look.. I feel nervous about seeing someone.
Thanks

I had to move out of my house, 2 months ago now due to having a psycho landlord and being unemployed...I moved in with my parents, which I believe has made me even more depressed. They also live about a 4 hour drive south of my home city...so im feeling pretty isolated and out of it now. Although living down here Ive been able to save money, and have now paid off all of my debts. Even though my situation isnt great I feel I am now mentally stronger, I really cant stand living down here anymore! My family are so critical, such anxious people. I feel like moving on. I try to apply for jobs but just getting through all these written applications is such a strain. Im going away in 2 weeks time for 2 weeks which will be a nice break, but I will have to come back here afterwards! I wasnt necessarilly depressed before I moved down here but now I am! Im having counselling but I am struggling...I dont know which direction to go in....

I've been fighting depression on and off for over 10 years. Will it ever end because it feels like I'm fighting a losing battle. I don't want to feel like this for the rest of my life. I also don't ever want to go back on medication, that just made me feel num.

Why is it that my mind never thinks about the positive stuff happening in my life? I've recently made new friends, moved into a great apartment and landed myself a really nice guy who is so supportive with my current health issues. Yet I my mind only cares about the stuff that could go wrong/the friends I don't have/the extra support I need but too scared to reach out for.
Not a single day passes without me wishing to somehow disappear. I take medication for my depression/anxiety and have started to see a psychologist but know it could be a while yet before I start to see some positive changes. What are some tips to make the days easier to get through in the meantime?

As most of you know, my biggest problem since depression got a hold of me has been anger.  My mood would swing towards anger over the smallest things, and i said some horrible things to both my partner and the kids.  I have been on anti-depressants for nearly 5 weeks now,
Last night my mother and I had gotten some tea and my sister asked us to grab her a bottle of wine from the drive thru.  When we get there another car had pulled in just before us, got to the service area turned the car off and all the occupants get out.  They spend the next 15 minutes looking around for what they wanted, while we are stuck in the car waiting.  This is a situation where i normally would have gotten very frustrated and angry, however, my very mild mannered calm mother was the one getting angry and i remained the calm the whole time and told her to chill out and relax.  i think the medication is really working and stopping my moods swinging.  Before the depression got a hold of me, i was different, i didnt get angry like i have over the past few years.  i think im returning to who i was.  if only i could tell Tara, this might all go away, she might see i am changing for the better
I am still struggling with anxiety, my stomach is constantly churning, like i feel something is going to go wrong,  I cant make it stop, only when my mind is distracted does it stop, but as soon as i stop my mind goes straight back to stressing.  Only 10 days to go and at least I will know whats going on, for better or for worse

My journey so far has been an up and down ride, like a roller coaster. It started last yr in early August when i was admitted to hospital,I stayed in hospital for approx 5 or 6 days. After i was released it was very tough, very emotional. my feelings were all over the place, as time has gone on and as i have made connections my training of thoughts anf feelings have become more common and i am not having as bad times as i was before.
The thoughts that i get now are just a little bit of loneliness occasionally. Even though i am still in my early stages compared to other people that i have made connections with, i can notice a change in the way i'm thinking and my thoughts. 
It is with the help of everyone here at Beyond Blue and many other support sites and people that i have been able to move forward along my pathway. I still have a long way to go but i can very much see the change that i have made since last August.
I have been having a feeling inside me like something was missing and i now know what I was missing as the feeling has gone, I was missing a girlfriend. I have just met her and we have so much in common and are so much in love with eachother.
To each and everyone of you here on this forum i say thankyou for all of your kind, caring,supporting, inspiring thoughts and messages.
I have FAITH, BELIEF in all of you that we will get better in the future.
Kind Regards
Chris

Hi all, and to all, I say ""hi""
In another post our dear friend Geoff in part of one of his sentences wrote about ""levels of depression"".  And it was excellent, because it got me thinking.
How do we explain the different levels of depression and indeed, ARE there different levels of depression?  If there are, then the rest of my below vent isn't needed, and the only thing it will have done will be to continue to exercise my fingers as they tap away at the glorious keyboard in front of me.  So vent commencing now:
I'm diagnosed with chronic depression.  But what if someone else is diagnosed with depression with no word of 'chronic' in front of it.  Are they better off than me?  Am I chronically more worse off than them?  I would answer ""no"" to both questions.  
And you know for the first time, I've never even questioned that.  ""Look if someone has depression, they have depression Doc"".  
Or am I being blase/silly here, and there are levels of depression;  hence:  ""we have someone who comes in and has these kinds of issues, so we'll label this person with ""garden variety depression"" and then we have someone coming in who is presenting all these kinds of things, and so instead of being just in the garden, this person is at the top of the tree, with chronic depression"".
You know, now that I've actually written this out I think I have got the answer and perhaps it IS ""yes"".  When I've had my mental health plan done with my GP (3 of them now), there is a series of questions you have to answer and I think this is something called the K10 test;   10 questions and if you answer them and get the score of 10, you are fine and healthy, not a problem with you (although you may have an ingrown toe-nail, but that's for another website to be concerned with) and off you go on your merry way.
50 is the absolute worst and you can't get a higher score than that and I believe that would mean immediate hospitalisation.
The first time I did the test, I scored 32.  Not good, but definitely not terrible.  I was still depressed, but not acute.
A year ago I did the test and I was 42.  Much worse and nowhere near good and closing in on the not good side.  
In December I did the test and I scored 45.  Very bad and things remain to be so.  My point here is, perhaps something over 40 would be labelled as being chronic depression and anything between, oh I don't know, 25 to 40 would be depressive symptoms.
Gee, I can waffle ... but it does help you know ... if you just cannot talk to others due to this illness, it does help to be able to write things down.  And for years I've done this with creating a journal about my thoughts ... but now I've found Beyond Blue and these wonderful forum sites, I can just type away to my heart is, as they say in the classics, content.  I'm sure that most people will see that it's another post from me and will bypass it, simply cause otherwise, that'll be 15-20 mins of their life they won't get back having had to trawl through the tripe that I tend to post.  But that's ok ... cause I've read it ... just the once and it is kinda therapeutic.
Are there different levels of depression?   Ok, now I believe there are.  But only after comprehensive scientific research had been conducted, as you'll have noticed from above.  ;)
Over and out,
Neil

I'm struggling to accept and find ways to get myself through  the depression and anxiety taking over my body at the moment. I attended the doctors about 2 months ago and they alerted needed immediate help. I'm a very proud person and have found it hard to accept and I'm almost embarrassed which makes me ashamed. Since then not a lot has changed  I'm struggling big time and although my partner tried he finds it difficult to understand and because I don't understand it myself yet I can't really explain it. My anxiety takes over my entire world to the point where I had to leave my career which I loved. I've never done anything like this or reached out asking for help but I'm at the stage I need help because I'm terrified and unsure what to do. I don't enjoy opening up which makes my recovery all the more difficult, if anyone has any advise with regard to how to move past this, how to explain to my partner because I need him more then anything.
Struggling through life is not fun

Im sitting here at my mums, stressing, crying and thinking about this stupid illness that effects each of us on here, either personally or a loved oneWhy does it effect us all in such different ways?I read some people struggle to find/perform work while they suffer with it...This has never been an issue for me, even with my social anxiety problems, i have always held a good job, i interview well.  when my resume makes it through and i get an interview, i always at least get a 2nd interview.   Even when i was unemployed for the last little period of my life, i was offered a couple of jobs in there that i had to turn down for different reasons (maybe my mind created these reasons, i dont know)i read some people who want to be alone, want to be away from loved ones, dont want people around them.  I am the TOTAL opposite of this, i am craving affection more than any time in my life.  I want to be around people, i want to talk to people, i want to be close.  I dont have that sort of relationship with my mum or my sister where i am living, and i dont really have any friends.  My kids are away from me so i cant be close to them at the minute, and Tara I would give everything i owned just to be able to hold her at the minute, to be able to sit down and talk to herWhy did this horrible illness make me so angry?  It turned me into a horrible horrible person. I said and did things i can never take back to the people who mean the most to be in the world.  The depression didnt make me do or say those things, those were my actions that i have to live with, but it made my moods change.My moods changing has caused me to lose the most important things in my life, my kids and my best friend/my only friend/my partnerIf i lose Tara i dont think i want to keep going. Its scaring me, i am having serious suicidal thoughts and i am having trouble making them go away and i have no one to talk to and i dont know what im going to do - i think i can make it to tuesday but i dont know what i will do if she chooses to continue the IVO process because these thoughts are getting harder and harder to ignore... 'beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Dear all I am having an awful morning. I woke up feeling really emotional & don't know why. My husband woke up shortly after & I could tell he was upset. He said I don't communicate anymore as I shutdown & isolate myself & he feels like he is living alone. He criticised my medication, my Drs & my wish to talk about Beyond Blue. He said he'd had enough suffering. I asked if he would read about depression and he said why would he read it when he lives with it everyday. He was harsh & angry. I wanted to explain to him that if he read material he might be more compassionate & hopeful. Sometimes I think he must believe I enjoy all this. Can't he see I'm in pain hurting, not knowing where my mind will end up next? I'd do anything to stop my thoughts & experience happiness. I spent $200 I didn't have on Selfhelp books the past few weeks. I'm trying so so hard. And I took my son out as promised yesterday & spoilt him even though I didn't feel like it-I forced myself for him. Then I got home and rarely does this happen, but I was overwhelmed to end it all. But my safety net is my kids & I don't think I could ever do that to them. This morning I'm so overwrought with emotion and want to never stop the tears but I can only feel them flow softly down my face. (Neil I want to cry & cry like you but I can't). It's not going to be a good day by the way things are going. I need to find myself somehow. For those that don't know-I left home at 19 & moved into a share house of young people. Until then I had been supporting my mum who had breast cancer & 2 younger sisters. I stayed that long as my Dad had abused me & I waited until  he left before I did. My self worth/esteem was so low I thought that the first person to show me any form of love &/or affection I'd stick with. So at 19 I married a guy in that house & we still together today although we've endured so much with my illness. His leukaemia & issues with kids. Anyway today I feel really sad. My husband is so angry I'm only seeing Drs/Psychiatrists who prescribe more medication each visit. My Pysch knows my history & says I have PTSD, trauma. Severe anxiety & chronic depression. She said I will always live with the pain but hopefully come to accept it as a chapter of my life & move on to the next chapter. Don't you hate those days you get up & could start crying before you hit the bathroom. It's a roller coaster. I like GA mentioned in a previous post hate the fear of not knowing what's going to hit me when. I feel I'm a hopeless, unmotivated, unfuctionaning, wreck of a person who used to be so bright & fun & happy & loveable. Now I'm a lonely isolated stuck at home feeling worthless person who is heading nowhere. I hope you are all doing a little better than me this morning. Lve Mares xxx

Lately I have started to feel better than I have been.  I have a long way to go.  Went to drug and alcohol counseling which has helped.  I know it's going to take some time before I get to that happy place,  but at least I'm heading in the right direction. My hubby still gives me grief for hanging out with a friend. He didn't like me getting my tongue pierced. Now he complained that I want to dye my hair black.

Hey everyone :)
I wanted to write on here because I spend so much of my day biting my tongue. My friends and family ask ""how are you?"" and I give an automatic bright smile and reply with ""Great! how are you?""
I feel relieved to find an online forum where I can give an honest answer.
And honestly? I'm NOT okay. Not even a little bit.
I'm angry. I'm tired. I'm really hurt. I want to be around those I love, but I dont want to have to interact with them in any way. I get confused easily, I feel frightened all the time. I dont sleep - I just worry. Every night, my mind replays in alarming clarity everything I've ever done wrong and every hurtful event I've ever encountered. I arrive at work for my 9-hour shift exhausted but I keep going because right now, I'm the sole 'breadwinner' for my Fiance and I and everything relies on my ability to get the rent paid and put food in our fridge and cupboards. Albeit pot noodle and baked beans, at least we're still getting fed.
But I want to shout ""STOP"" and I want to go home - to bed - and stay there for about 3 months.
I want so badly to say I'm really hurting. To tell someone that I'm really unhappy. I feel so lost and so alone and I'm so stressed, strung out and under so much pressure that I literally think my head will explode. I feel desperate.
I really want to say to my friends - I'm broken and you dont have to fix me, just hold onto me. Hold onto me so that I dont fall apart and remind me that things are going to be better. Please just tell me that you still care, you still like me and although I feel like I'm losing my mind - you'll still be there when the smoke clears.
I'm at the stage where I'm so unhappy, I dont know how to get through today. I would rather...not.
It's 9am now...I have 8 hours of very stressful work at Reception until I can go home again.
How do I do this?

Hi my names Mitch , in February of 2013 I was diagnosed with a condition known as brachial  neuritis ,  it is basically a condition where  my nerves in my shoulder / back on my right side becomes inflamed and I have lost muscles and movement. Being a very active 21 year old you can imagine how hard this hit me , I also lost my job around this time and nothing seemed to be going right ,  I have since found it hard to get motivated to do things I used to love , have trouble sleeping , I am moody where I have never normally be . I also get headaches regularly and seem to have muscle / nerve pain in other parts of my body out of nowhere . Has anybody has any experience with depression causing physical problems ? 
Thanks

I have plenty to fill my time with, but I find I need to use so much energy to start and then stay focused. Any suggestions?

I am so scared of next tuesday
I know I have done everything asked of me in the temp IVO, i have not contacted Tara even though every impulse i have in my body wanted to
I have done everything I can think of to improve myself (Meds, Psychologist, Enrolled in Mens Behaviour Change Program, Given up drinking coke, working on mensline anger management worksheets, writing stuff to get it out of my head, have a job and an interview thursday for one much closer to home, gotten a myself a car)
What happened at the start of december knocked me to the canvas...it has taken every ounce of strength i have to get myself back up and to the point where i am now.
If it goes bad next week, i know i dont have the strength to fight back again, i dont even know if i want to fight back to be honest
Im scared...so so scared and its making me feel sick

The past two days have been ok. I have alternated between a sober mood and a manic ones. I literally could not sit down two evenings ago. My mind would not stop racing. Thoughts chasing thoughts, around around my head. Yesterday afternoon, I couldn't stop laughing. Half the things weren't even funny. Last night there was some little comment or other- something incredibly petty and I was just suddenly so angry at my husband. It made no sense. 

This morning I am torn between wanting to punch walls and cry in a corner. 

If only I could control this. I don't necessarily want to jump off my rollercoaster ride but riight now I want to bash my hands against the safety railing. There's got to be something better than this awful state. There's got to be a way out. 

I am not winning against the monsters in my head today. One of them has me swallowed whole and I don't know when he's going to spit me out.

Hi All,
It's been a beautiful day in the sun and for a while there I felt normal. Until I remembered I'm  not. I am a drug abuser and suffer from depression. It is almost 4 years ago since so my first hospitalisation and yet it seems like yesterday. The same fear,  shame , anxiety and the overwhelming sadness I felt at having been reduced to that state washes over me still when I am feeling particularly low. How did it happen I ask myself over and over.
Now after years of therapy and four more admissions I still have these feelings. I still feel bad!. One good thing in hospital was the shared feelings and camaraderie you tend to develop with fellow sufferers after a few months.
I joined BB to help fill that gap and the support has been good but part of me says I don't want to be in this 'club ' anymore. Is it just me ? I don't want to have my GP and Psych on speed dial. I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on meds that make me fat and stupid. And I really don't want that tag hanging around my neck forever of 'someone that needs to watched '( ""you know because of what  she did"")  I have been waiting to see my psych for a month due to Christmas etc and I am climbing out of my skin.
It's never over. No matter how much better you become or how you seemingly get back to normal. You are not allowed to forget, ever! It's great that people from BB are going on TV, I'm all for it  and if it helps make the subject less taboo then that's wonderful. But the reality for those of us  living with depression is that we face discrimination, lack of understanding. and rejection on a daily basis and more often than not it's not from strangers but people we know and love.
I want my family and friends to ""get it"", but the problem is I agree with most of the misconceptions out there. I loathe myself for what I've become and the friends and money I've lost. I can't give them back this time. I can't make it better. So all I can do is to try to make myself less loathsome  and carry on. This is where the meds help. But then................................ Yep I hate myself all over again for being so weak. 
Feeling  really shattered at the moment and despising myself for not doing what I know I need to do

I think I have depression, I think I have had it a very long time. How am I supposed to get help? What do I say? I am really afraid.

Hi - I'm really sorry to say this to everyone but I need to vent it somewhere so i thought here would be a good place.For the last several years I've been battling depression and suicide thoughts. As I'm sure others can relate too, it's so incredibly difficult to get out of bed sometimes. I've been coping with it for years without any medical treatment or even seeing a doctor - maybe that was a big mistake.When I get these suicidal thoughts (almost daily) I can immediately recognise the difference between ""what I WANT to do"" and ""what I would ACTUALLY do"". But today, for the first time ever........I felt like I couldn't trust myself. If I was ever going to do something I know exactly how it would be done but I had always trusted myself and knew that I wouldn't do anything. Now, all of a sudden and completely out of the blue, I don't trust myself and I'm terrified that I'm going to have a ""moment"". It was so bad that my work had taken my car keys off me and refused to let me drive home without an escort. I don't know what to do. I always trusted myself but now I feel like I can't even trust myself anymore. Does this mean it's getting worse? All my supervisors know now and it's so embarrassing. Am I over reacting or has this happened to others where you always trusted yourself not to do anything but now you feel like that you may not be able too?beyondblue’s clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I have been seeking help for depression for nearly 33 months now and find myself loosing it more and more often over the past few months. I have been keeping my GP up to date with my medication detals and support newtork details, but my frends, family and myself are getting worried that I am getting worse and even my treating pysicoligist has asked my permissing to break confidance. 
I'm not sure where to go from here and I don't know what to tell my GP.

Me of late … well it’s so hard to put into words.  I know a lot of you have been asking over the last little while.   I’m just so incredibly sad.  Just so low.  And then it makes me angry … with myself and sometimes it borders to others as well.  Not that I want to do any harm to anyone, but it’s just so difficult to express.   
Just over the last couple of days, what I think I’m realising is that I’m still in heavy mourning and still overcome with grief from the loss of my brother and my Dad.  And it’s a long time to be coping with this … 1991 for my bro and 2007 for my Dad.  But I kind of feel like why should I be happy when they’re no longer here.  I feel that why should I get any enjoyment out of anything;  cause Dad and my bro aren’t here anymore to enjoy such things.  Even more so for my brother, cause he was just 29 when I lost him.  But yeah, it’s sometimes like it’s in the days after the funeral, where everyone else is getting on with their lives and I think, “to hell with that … I can’t and won’t live properly – I’m going to continue to feel sad, because I have too.  No one else does this, f**k everyone else, I’m going to feel sad for them forever and I’ll show it to everyone”.   
And all the while, I’m just wasting away my life … and am worried every day that my kids will be ok, that they will turn out alright.   This low, awful feeling has been with me for so long now … and it’s really getting to me you know.  I see my Doc, I see my psychiatrist, my meds have been reviewed;  I have recently had another mental health check and that proved that yes, I am definitely not a normal functioning human being … I’m just … I can’t … anyway, they’ve got me a series of appointments with my psychologist, but the first one isn’t for another month yet. 
 I exercise every day, we have pets at home which are great, by the way … and yet I still feel this low.  
This unbelievable sadness that is ripping the absolute guts out of me.   
You know, I’m on here every day and I reply to all sorts of different folks … wonderful folks … but all the time, you’re hearing these posts from someone who is among their lowest ebbs in life.  I can’t do anything to end my life … I couldn’t and won’t do that to my beautiful family.  For as much torture and hell that I live through every day, if I did that, it would destroy them.  For anyone else who might be reading this … if you’re at that particular way of thinking … please think of the people you’d be hurting so badly who would be left.  I know we have these thoughts and how nice it’d be to not wake up again, but we can’t do this.  I’ve mentioned that we have the demons, the torture, the living hell inside our minds every day … but there’s nothing for it … despite doing you know  “all the right things that they say you should do”, I still am no better.  I’m clearly getting worse. 
  So there we are, we are just a under-performing, under-achieving (whoops, sorry, that should have said I am) ……………………….. I want to scream out, I want to cry, but I can’t do the latter and  I’d frighten everyone in this workplace if I did the former.  
 I can’t even think of anything funny to say.  
 Bye for now  
 Neil

Can someone reply please, i need to talk. I would like some company, wish people would msg me but they don't and when i do they say sometimes you have to deal with it on your own. I just want to talk about things in general.
I feel lonely it's like no one has time for me everyone is off doing their own thing with other people. I would like to meet all of you in person and to tell our stories and experiences face to face. 
I'm starting to question myself wondering wheather i am actually good enough for anyone including myself.
Kind Regards
Chris

Hi my name is Chris,
I have been suffering from multiple diagnosed disorders for most of my life, the earliest being when i was 7, i am now 19.
I have been in and out of psychiatrists and psychologists my whole life, it just does not seem to get better. Professionals have seemed to be able to somewhat ease my OCD, this was my biggest problem for a while, but now other problems seems to be arising. The biggest at the moment being my depression and anxiety issues.
I went through a stage of self harm, which is now under wraps. But i seem to be finding more destructive ways to deal with depression and anxiety.
I feel an overwhelming urge to make people happy around me even if it comes at the price of my own mental health, for example, recently i had a fight with my girlfriend of about 2 months, it is a fairly new relationship by my standards, instead of standing up for my morals, i automatically went in to a submissive mode and tried everything to make her happy again and resolve the argument, but i did fail and things haven't been the same with us since, i am constantly worrying day and night that she is going to dump me, which has made me fall into one of my oldest habits, which is drinking, to ease the anxiety i am feeling.
My depression recently is also affecting my new job, as a bottle shop retailer, i spend most of my day alone, which is a lot of time to think when i am not serving customers or restocking, i missed my first shift this week, just because i wanted to sleep all day and forget about everything.
I am worried this drinking habit is also going to evolve into a deeper problem, as i have a long family line of alcoholics.
I don't know what to do and who to turn to guys...i really need help, but i feel i have exhausted all the help i can get at this stage. I am on medication, i have regular appointments with professionals and i surround myself with family for support. I'm just worried about what i might do next.

As the title suggests, at this very moment in time on this day at this time like time is still something doesn't feel right. My facial expression that i feel tells me something is wrong, i feel a worried look on my face. I look out my window and into the bright light of the suns rays and i think what is missing, before everything started back in August of last yr i was in a similar life position and i felt gd but now that i have gone through what i have i feel something left me when i got admitted to hospital in August and since then i have been trying to get back what left me.
 Why can't i see the qualities in myself and yet other people can? I see them sometimes but most of the time i'm just so oblivious to them like i'm blinded by everything else that is going on in my life that i some how don't recognise my qualities. Is it because my head is full of other things e.g. peoples names, appointments etc. 
I've felt like this for a couple of days now. Have been doing other things to take my mind of it but in the end it all comes back to the same place. It doesn't disappear it just lays dormant for a couple of hours then comes back in a slow and yet powerful way. 
Cheers
Chris
