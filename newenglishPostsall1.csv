My sister is depressed. She breaks down every night. Tonight she called my parents and told them she is sorry for everything and she is not brave. Last week, her boyfriend broke up with her and when I asked her what's wrong she said that no one respects her (even me).
I care so much about her but the thing is that she hardly listens to me. She doesn't eat food and I feel it is spoiling her health too.
History: My sister has been having sudden break downs from past 8 years. But in this month it has gotten a lot.
If any one of you have experienced the same situation with someone or within your family, any advice is appreciated. I am so bloody concerned about her guys. Please help me out!

I started to feel more like myself last year as I made some progress with my mental health after feeling deeply depressed and anxious for a long time. I’ve just started my last semester of uni before I graduate, then I’m doing honours.
Last year my older sister and her husband decided to stop renting and start doing housesitting to save for a house deposit . I’ve never had a good relationship with her and I can’t stand her husband for extended periods of time. Knowing that there would be gaps in between the housesitting my mum said that they could stay with us, and they did for 3 weeks. I had told my mum that I didn’t think I would be able to cope if they stayed with us for longer than a week and that maybe she could set some boundaries for how long they could stay with us. She said that she would never turn away her daughter. It's my mum’s house so obviously I just had to accept it. During my uni break all I really wanted was to spend time alone to try to take better care of myself so I felt so disappointed. When they left I thought it would be the last time they would stay for so long. Then in January they moved back in (there weren’t any housesits because of the bushfires) and they’ve been here almost 3 months (now it's the coronavirus). They’re going on a short trip but after that it seems like they’re going to live here indefinitely.
Up until recently my sister was unemployed and was home with me everyday, whilst job searching she had frequent meltdowns. She has her own mental health problems is in denial, even though we encourage her and  my mum even gave her $1000 to pay for sessions she still hasn’t seen a psychologist. When my sister and her husband fight in the house makes me feel physically sick. Inside I could feel myself sinking to despair that I haven’t felt in years. It feels like I don’t have my own space anymore, the kitchen and the house is a mess because there isn’t enough room for their stuff.
 I’ve started seeing a new psychologist, I’m still on medication I started last year, and I go to yoga classes every week. But I don’t have the capacity to cope anymore. I’m so stressed by uni and by home that it feels impossible to focus on my assignments. I just feel hopeless and out of control of my own life. I felt really hopeful about this year in terms of my mental health getting better in a way that I have rarely felt, now I just feel crushed and I can't afford to move out.
I loved this house but it doesn’t even feel like my home anymore.

Hi There
Just posting as a way to vent frustration really.   I feel there really isn't a lot of help out there for people with a mental illness.  I've seen 2 GP's for depression in the last year.   They've recommended talk therapy which I've tried but feel like it's just a band aid really.  I feel fine when I'm going, but can't always attend as it can be expensive even on a mental health plan.    Saw my GP 2 weeks ago and made an appointment to see a psychologist on my latest mental health care plan,  but can't get into to see her until next Saturday.  I made the appointment straight after seeing my GP, which means I've had to wait 3 weeks overall to see someone.   Have tried to see someone through my work but can't get in to see someone for 2 weeks there either.  
I've tried everything but medication really.   Tried yoga, meditation, exercise, eating right.  But nothing seems to get rid of my depression.  Just incredibly frustrated with the whole thing.

Hi, I am a 39 year old woman who has undiagnosed (but definitely) BPD and I have just ruined another online relationship with somebody because I couldn't handle yet another burst of emotional dysregulation.

I have tried to undo the damage with all my heart, but my friend is not responding (and probably rightly so) so now I am spiralling along the path of yet another rejection (but also knowing that it was self inflicted, of course) and am back to being crushingly lonely and craving connection with another human being.

I prefer online contact now because it means I can't 'mirror' the other person like I do in a physical meet-up, which means I allow my 'true self' to shine through, although it has lead me to interpret written words in the wrong manner and was the main cause of the last disaster.

So, how does a person with BPD find friends?

I am aware that I have many qualities and gifts to offer as a friend, but when I have a BPD episode (even if I have informed the other person that I have it and what it is) my friends are often horrified and unable to reconcile the 'me' they thought they knew and the emotionally crashing mess in front of them. Enter awkwardness, enter apologies, enter....rejection. And I didn't mean to do it, not one bit. I just get overwhelmed, trapped in a vicious cycle of self doubt, needing constant relationship status reassurance and wondering whether I am good enough for the other person. 

Actually, after the storm passes and I have purged, I have more clarity and better resiliance to the matter at hand...but unfortunately, the other person has usually already bailed. Also, ironically, this does NOT happen on any other level in my life - it is ONLY when I have a close interpersonal relationship with someone that I like. If the other person is abusive or violent or aggressive....I am cool, calm and collected, with all the right responses and an incredible amount of tolerance. I don't understand it, but that's the way it is. It also means I am at risk for seeking out such terrible people because it is the only time I feel in control. Thankfully, my rational mind knows that is bad news and I steer clear.

But where to from here? If I can't deal with liking someone (or they like me) and I can't be around people who are, well, nasty - what is left? How am I supposed to stop being lonely if I can't connect to someone? Anyone?

Do I look for people who have BPD? Will it mean that we will be more understanding of each other or will we feed off each others fear of ultimate rejection?

Do I look for people who have experienced another person with BPD and hope that they can understand me?

Or do I have meaningless, casual relationships that never go beyond generalised chit chat?

Any advice is welcome. I am floundering, exhausted, embarressingly desperate for a connection of some kind but also scared to involve another because I am well-aware of my capacity to hurt and confuse them with my outbursts and this is by far the worst torment I suffer - my negative impact on others (on occasion).

My attempts to control my behaviour with self-help books and research has clearly failed, so I am currently looking for a BPD therapist in my area.

Thank you.

Hi all
I have had anxiety and depression on and off my whole life. Over the past year though it has gotten progressively worse to the point where I am barely getting through each day. Thank god I have a loving and supportive wife.
It all started going downhill about a year ago. I stopped speaking to my small group of friends (I live in the city) and really isolating myself. I basically just worked, went to the gym, and spent time with my wife on weekends.
 I didn't realise how important socializing was for mental health. I told myself that I didn't need anyone and kept doing my routine. Over the past year though I found myself doing less and less. Besides work, gym, and my wife I didn't really do anything. I got really good at distracting myself with YouTube, Facebook, and podcasts but on the inside I was struggling.
 At the start of this year a close family member of mine passed away. I also just found out my mum has cancer. My wife and I live away from our home town so it has been difficult being away from everyone back home. 
I have the shakes constantly and have lost some weight because I can barely eat due to stomach cramps. I am writing this at 2am in the morning because I struggle to sleep.
My wife and I have decided to move back to our home town to be closer to friends and family. I am nervous about finding work but am also hopeful for a better future. We have some savings and are debt free. We both have qualifications and have good work references. We will be staying with my brother and I am looking forward to spending more time with him.
Anyway thats my story. If anyone else has moved back to their hometown to start over, please let me know.

Hi
I have always suffered from anxiety but have had it under control with medication until now! I am suffering from paralyzing anxiety and depression brought on by my husband's suicide in Oct 2019. For the first 4 months I was doing ok...but when I started counseling I crashed and burned. Now my life is out of control physically, emotionally and  financially... just need to know that life will become functional and productive again!
Thanks for listening.

Hi all,
its kinda hard to put into words how I feel but I’m going to try.
Ive had anxiety for a few years now, it used to be really bad about 4-5 years ago but I got it under control. The past 5-6 months I’ve had some pretty shit things happen in my life (workload, family issues and issues with my partners family). I thought I was handling it well and then one day I woke up and realised I needed help, I wasn’t doing ok and I noticed my moods were very low. 
I went from absolutely adoring my partner, planning a future, booking holidays, doing life things that made me happy to having no “love” or “joy” from anything. My relationship has turned. I’m so distant and have no sex drive, I have no desire to do the life things I wanted to and no excitement for my big European holiday this year. This also brings out my anxiety and makes me feel worse.
im at a total loss. I started seeing a psychologist but I just find I can’t get out of this depressive state (only been twice now) 
I noticed tonight I can go from being how I use to be to quickly going into this depressive state. 
I don’t know what to do, its really affecting me socially and my relationship with my boyfriend and family.
I just wanna know the way I’m feeling isn’t just me going crazy in my own head and there is a way to deal with this feeling or lack of feeling.
 
thanks!

Long story short my bf broke my heart I lost it and screamed cried. I didn’t want to hurt myself or do anything stupid I just couldn’t handle the pain of it. I had to have a Valium to sleep. After waking up I felt exhausted and numb like thinking what he did to me it’s like my mind couldn’t see it straight and I couldn’t feel the sadness of it. I hate feeling pain but I’d rather feel something than nothing at all. Just a short back story my mum killed her self 9 yrs ago I found her, after a couple of days of still being in shock I guess I felt numb ppl said I was really strong but I just blocked out the pain and couldn’t talk about it. Is that what my mind is doing when it’s over powered with to much emotion it wants to shut down? Is that healthy? I’ve also got GAD so I over analyse things. I can still feel sad but the big things I block out.

Hi,
I’ve had depression for 15 years but I was still quite high functioning until 2 years ago. At that time my world fell apart. My depression has been so severe and the most distressing symptom is the memory loss. I don’t remember hardly anything about my life and it’s like my memory is being wiped from minute to minute. I have forgotten all of the knowledge I built during my career and I’m unable to retain any new information. My vocabulary has been reduced to only a few words because I’ve forgotten the rest. I go to places I’ve been going to for twenty years and they don’t feel familiar. My psychiatrist says I’m suffering pseudo dementia.
I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced the same thing. I’ve been to a lot of depression support groups and no one else reports this symptom. I just want to know im not alone and to hear from someone who understands.
 Thanks for reading.

i have two adult children at home from first marriage that don’t work. Always full of excuses. 
my husband of 8 yrs and I have separated, we have been trying to fix our marriage but it’s a struggle with my two lazy ones and his kids from first marriage who don’t like me for entering their dads lives. They are adults as well.
im so depressed, I don’t want to do nothing. And I don’t want to get help in fear everyone thinks I’m a worthless mother, I have children with my recent husband. I have been put down by his family that it’s actually crushed me but I try to stay above the water.

Hello, 
I would very much appreciate your advice. My partner is currently going through grief, especially the depression phase of the grief cycle. That is obviously more periodic depression rather than clinical, however I assume that the symptoms and pains he experiences are very similar. I would like to understand better how I best communicate with him without causing him pressure and stress or accidental hurt. I am generally there for him and just let him know that he can always turn to me if he wishes to. But as we are manoevering how this is affecting the progress of our relationship, I have also shared my feelings and needs with him. I have done that in an email because he currently feels particularly comfortable when we write to each other. That way, we can both take the time to think through our response and what we think and feel. I am happy with that, so I wrote him an email telling him how I felt a little sad but how I also understand that some of the decisions we have recently had to make are the wisest thing to do right now even if not easy. I also told him that for now, I can live with the new arrangements we have put in place for us (i.e. taking it very slowly and curbing some of our previously made plans) but that I would also need to have those arrangements be temporary only. Basically, I said, I am ok with the distance and undefined nature while he focuses on rebuilding his foundation but that I would not be able to do that forever because I would need to see that we are slowly but steadily moving forward together. Are those sorts of things ok to say or are they counter-productive in his current state? He is currently starting to embrace the requirements to have more social interaction again and actively do things to avoid getting stuck in the depressive phase. I think that is great and I have given him positive feedback and encouragement because I think that is an excellent move. So I do not want to impact him negatively but I also feel I need to be honest and share my own feelings so we are communicating well and transparently. I am cautious and benevolent in my approach and I told him there is no need for him to hurry anything or feel pressure. I just felt it was important that he knows there will come a time for me when I cannot continue this way. I do not want to keep that from him and then, if it eventuates, hit him out of the blue. I would rather avoid it altogether by building awareness and therefore countermeasures together.

Hi folks

I'm KRY and have just joined. I'm hoping to be able to make some meaningful contributions by sharing my personal experiences with depression and anxiety, and as a carer/supporter for my sibling who has been struggling with mental health for several years now.

In high school I had one close friend attempt to take her life and diagnosed with BPD, another close friend diagnosed with schizophrenia. I first felt that something was not right with myself in my late teens, but rationalised that whatever I was feeling was just teen hormones and dismissed whatever I felt as being nothing as serious as my friends. It wasn't until several years later in my final years of university that I sought professional help.

I'm doing much much better with managing my depression and anxiety these days. I would say that since high school, I've always had a good awareness of mental health and conditions, but not how it applied to me.

Last year, something scarier than all the hopelessness, loneliness and sense of overwhelm I felt at my worst happened... My sibling self-harmed in an attempt to escape their mental struggles. For all my personal experience, being my sibling's confidante and general awareness of various mental health conditions, none of that prepared me for this. My sibling is doing better now and I continue to be part of their immediate support group.

Looking back, I wish:
1. I had a friendly adult I could trust and talk to in high school, so it could be identified earlier that I needed help.
2. I had found out earlier about all the free and credible resources available, so I didn't feel so helpless or vulnerable/ashamed to ask.
3. I was part of a community that withheld judgement and could empathise and/or understand my struggles and confusion.
4. I was able to attend a seminar/forum/expo with my family so I could educate them earlier on mental health and remove stigmatism.
5. Understood my rights especially in regards to privacy/confidentiality, so I didn't have to feel pressured to tell the GP everything I told my psychologist, then feel vulnerable and judged in order to get a new script.

I'm looking forward to checking out the different threads and helping the community.

Hi All, long time no posts.
I have seen a psychiatrist for 20 odd years, now only 3 monthly. Seen psychologist for about 5 years on mental health plan. Still see both.
l have had Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, etc,nearly all my life, am 60ish. Can’t beat it, omg have l tried, have done everything my psychs suggested and more.
Have osteoarthritis so have pain and physical limits. 
It’s the dysthymia that won’t go away and l fight it everyday. I’m tired off it. Made huge steps towards recovery last year so expected 2020 to be a better year and disappointed as it’s not. The dysthymia seems to be getting the better of me.
Does it ever go away, I am medicated but still struggle.

I am lost. My depression is now at its worst. The GP's best efforts are not helping, and I've just sold the last guitar, the one I was keeping, and put all the money into an account for my daughter's. 
I have no joy in even looking at the wonderful piece of wood I've had since I started earning real money.
 
Cant even listen to music anymore.
 
I call and get no real help. I go to mental ward, get zero help there. 
The selling of the last guitar was a big moment.....I have her a pat when she left.
Next thing is my grandfather's 1973 Fiat 132. I need it to go to my eldest daughter. I don't know, I don't owe anyone any money, but if I ""accidentally"" get eaten by a shark, then I want to make sure some bottom feeder doesn't get it
 
Im at the end....there's no cross road......just end of line

I've been seeing a psychologist for about a year now. This has helped me with a lot of my anxiety issues as I was having panic attacks frequently as I had developed social anxiety. I often faint when I panic and was in constant fear of humiliating myself in public as it had happened a few times is social settings like being out for dinner. I still get anxiety but not as bad anymore.
Lately I've just been feeling really down about myself. And some days (like today) I just feel so low and like every choice I have made is wrong. Recently I began a Master's Degree and had to quit my full time job so I could study. I hated my job and felt liberated when I left. But now I feel so down because I am having trouble finding a part time or casual job, and am very worried about not having any income. I have applied for centrelink, but that may take weeks to come into effect.
I'm really struggling to stay motivated through online study, and cannot focus. I can read a passage of text and literally not retain a single thing. I feel stupid and like I am already falling behind my peers. I am concerned I have made the wrong decision in choosing to quit a job to complete further studies. I have reached out to some of my peers to start a study group in the hopes I can get some support, but I have an assignment deadline rapidly approaching and am concerned my work will be trash.
I am exhausted all the time, even when I get 8-9 hours sleep and I really struggle to get out of bed in the morning. I am overweight and try to take light walks but find I am even more exhausted afterwards. I just don't know what to do or how to get motivated.

Hi all.
Thank you for the opportunity to share my tale of woe and dispair.
This thing is going to be whinier then a three year old banned from paw patrol so buckle up. I apologize in advance for spelling and grammar issues. The public education system has failed me.
Chapter one:
The man behind the tears.
I'm a 30 y/o male carpenter, no kids. I currently have a partner of 3 years and live with her family.
I've struggled with depression for most of my life. I haven't been to a therapist, I find speaking candidly with people face to face difficult.
lately i am feeling extremely apathetic. I work 50 - 60 hour weeks and am exhausted most of the time.
I rent with my inlaws and have no substance abuse issues (besides coffee). Still i am struggling financially.  My partner has a chronic illness and is unable to work. 
Living with my inlaws the last 3 years has been a real struggle. However we are unable to move out due to our poor financial situation.
i find myself increasingly at my limit and have full scale meltdowns over mild inconveniences. 
This has been a particularly bad week as i have had some tools stolen. 
Partners grandmother passed
And partners phone has bricked itself.
For those playing at home, Data recovery is around $250 / $500.
 
Seeing my friends marrying, starting families and buying houses is very difficult for me. Im just treading water while they move to the next stages of their lives.
My partner is my rock but my constant indifference and lack of intamacy towards her is taking its toll.
I don't see things improving any time soon.  I hope you guys are doing better then me at this life business.

I feel lost. I have been trying really really hard to manage my anxiety and stay positive and take all the right steps to help myself, and for a few months I felt a bit better and even felt a bit empowered to offer some assistance to others but as of the last few days I have had terrible panic attacks again with nasty symptoms resurfacing and now I just feel really depressed and very disappointed that my efforts to overcome this condition are all in vain.  I have tried to eat well and do a bit of exercise, I have started online CBT therapy which have committed too and working really hard at but the debilitating symptoms have reared their ugly head again and now I just feel really sad and tired and quite hopeless really. I have a few challenging things going on in my life that I am trying to deal with but don't we all? I don't feel like I am getting much help from my GP and I am seeing a psychologist but the visits are nearly 2 months apart as she is busy, I feel hopeful on the actual day I see the psychologist but the feeling is gone by that evening so I don't feel I am getting much out of it. It takes a lot of energy and effort to live with anxiety and I just cant seem to muster up any more motivation or hope to fight this battle right now. Feeling very low.

I vent all the time so I thought why not create a forum for me and others to vent. Heres mine today.
 
My masked depression.

I sometimes wonder, would I be better off without emotions? I get so sad and angry and I hurt, alot.
I don't see much use for my emotions really, I may aswell just have sadness because that seems to be the only thing I can feel.
Sadness and anger, they can't really be controlled, can they? I try to supress my sadness but it flows out of me, I'm sure anybody can tell I'm sad.
But, its not just sadness, I feel alot of different things, sometimes I think, maybe despair, the whole world if it took over, everyone would feel like me.
But how do I describe my feelings, I mean to be fair I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, I guess I just wanted to vent.
My life really hasn't been the greatest, primary school was horrible but my parents just put it down to ""kids being kids"" It kinda hurts, having your experiences doubted by parents who weren't even there to experinece it all.
I don't really get an ""escape"" I'm stuck with this, this depression, sometimes I feel like I've made my depression into a whole new emotion, something different from what other people experience.
I have alot of really low points, I'll just cry and cry, sometimes I'll put on a happy face but thats just a mask.
A histerical mask, my depression, it feels like its driving me insane sometimes, I feel so numb but at the same time I'm feeling almost everything. 
I want to be taken away to a different world, where she cares, the girl I've tried so hard for, I just, I want to feel, I want feeling so badly.
But at the same time, I never want to feel another thing, because its so goddamn painful, I mean I'm in constant pain, whether It be mental or physical, I mean sure people are nice to me but it just, I can't fully appreciate it. 
I feel like a broken record writing this, I feel as if every line is just repeating the same thing, with no difference, but depression isn't even the only thing weighing me down.
She really thought I was getting better, because I was starting to look after myself a little more, but I guess I was just unintentionally masking it, can you even do that, put a mask on without even realizing it?
I guess stress is also a big factor in all of this, highschool, oh boy, I mean sure in thr long run it sounds fun but it makes me feel even worse, the people here are much smarter than me. Theres alot more but character limit got me by 1600 words.

Hi
I have been struggling with depression and a anxiety my whole life.
I have a good job, a degree, 2 kids, a wife and a house etc but I am never happy and I have a constant sense of impending doom.
I am basically an alcoholic, drug addict, and can not control my impulses on pretty much anything.
I have gone into a downward spiral over the past 6 months and really hit the alcohol hard. I have recently gotten into trouble with the police over a drunken assault and my wife is at her wits end with me. I am basically her third child.
I have really had a hard time transitioning from a partying 20 something into life as a Dad in my early 30’s. I am depressed all the time and have withdrawn from my friendship group as I am always anxious and don’t answer or return phone calls. I feel like I am just in a massive rut. I should be happy but I just can’t shake this depression and anxiety.
I also have massive problems with anger. I have never assaulted my wife but I flip out over anything minor and break things etc like a child.
My biggest challenge at this point is getting off alcohol. I have been going out drinking on my own to strip clubs and spending ridiculous sums of money which puts a massive strain on my marriage. Comes back to the impulse control I guess.
If anyone has any decent tips on how to get off alcohol I am all ears. I suffer from ADHD and everything seems very difficult at the moment. I am a liability to my family and I know they are ashamed of me at the moment as I am also ashamed of myself and my lack of self control.
I really hope I can get through this tough period and be a real man, Dad and Husband - it just seems like a monumental challenge..

My question is can your body get depressed 
Without you even knowing it?
So the last few months I've seen some changes 
In my body, getting 4 hours sleep if I'm lucky
And it's broken, not wanting to go out because 
I'm so tired, everytime I eat I feel sick. 
But the thing is my mind feels okay and
Yes I've had suffered from depression many 
Times before, also a few other things. I see 
My doctor on a regular basis, but of late it's 
Been hard finding the right time. It wasn't until 
A few days I thought my body might be depressed,
I started thinking about the stuff that has been 
Going on with me for the last few months and I 
Remember that I had a major operation about 
7 months ago and that's when it all started and
Has gotten worse over time. The reason that
I'm asking here is because I don't want to 
Worry family or friends and I find it hard to talk 
To them about this stuff because they don't 
Really understand it. So my question is can your 
Body get depressed without you knowing it???
Thank you to anyone who's taken the time to 
Read this, will answer any questions.

I have posted in the Family issues section before and received a lot of support which was very appreciated. My problem now is my DIL who my son in separated from has filed a protection order on me where I temporarily can't see my  two Grandsons. I attended Court a couple of days ago and i am fighting the charges with a very good Solicitor. I have lodged my Afadavit and my Solicitor is confident that I will come out on top as it is in his words to the Judge 'a vixacous and malicous attempt to get even with my son through me "" The hearing isn't until the 29th of April and I just feel miserable all the time.  All I want to do is sleep and hope when I wake up everything will be different.  How do I pull myself out of this  blue funk I'm in. I can't get in to see a Psychologist until 17 March.

I am seeking some tips on how to approach my mother to tell her how I feel and how I think I may possibly have depression?
I am afraid that she will dismiss my feelings, and ultimately feel uncomfortable at the thought of telling her. I want to seek professional help to enable me to understand and cope with my feelings and to know whether what I am feeling is 'normal' (lack of a better word) or is due an underlying issue. My father has depression, which has worsened severely since my parents broke up (I am in grade 11, they split in grade 5). He does not know that I know that, and only told me he had depression several months ago.
It is only recently that I have felt these symptoms worsen (app. past 3 months). I have been moving houses, and am still in the process of finding a new house to live in. The process is unbelievably frustrating and has made my overall mental health worsen severely. My productivity levels have stunted immensely over the past few months, and I feel so unmotivated. The best way I can describe how I feel is empty. I feel void of emotions a lot of the time, and will go through these periods several times a week (lasting 1-3 hours) where I feel extremely tired (even though I may have received adequate sleep that night) and like i'm just existing, like the world is operating around me but i'm frozen in time or in slow motion. In addition to this, I experience lots of anger and frustration, and the smallest things may set me off. I've lost enjoyment in lots of activities, and struggle to focus. I discussed them with my closest friends, one of which said she experienced the same feelings as well as point out that they are symptoms of depression. I have considered it momentarily before, but never seriously until now. I don't want to label it and self-diagnose or even suggest that I may have it as I feel like people will respond by thinking I am an attention seeker. This is also why I also struggle to voice my concerns to my parents, the last time I did so to my mother (about trouble concentrating in school and exhibiting ADHD symptoms) she dismissed my worries, and told me that it was because I spend ""too much time on my computer"" or other similar reasons.

Hi all,
Im kind of nervous about posting here since outside of my counsellor and my partner this is an issue I rarely speak about because of the shame and other not so pleasant feelings that it causes me and the person who matters most to me to experience.
A bit of backstory to set the scene. My parents separated from a young age. It wasn’t great to say the least but we all survived in our own way. Unfortunately a byproduct of that was during the times I got to hang out with my dad my mum would basically give me a script of things to say to him either to make him feel guilty or to somehow try and manipulate his emotions. I being a child at the time did it but soon wanted to stop as I could see how much it hurt him and so it began. I started just to lie and say I’d said those things and make up his reaction. The years went by and I continued this pattern to avoid hurting my dad and to just keep my mum off my back. 
Unfortunately the behaviour started to spread like a disease. It ranged from pretending I knew what I was talking about on various subjects, saying I’d heard a band or saw a movie when I didn’t. Seemingly innocuous stuff like that. It continued for a while at what I thought was a benign level, soon it shifted though. I started to realise I could avoid conflict/unpleasant situations by fabricating a lie. Due to growing up with a mother with a temper I have an aversion to conflict or situations that have negative feelings attached.
I also lie to make myself seem more interesting or knowledgeable as in reality I find myself to be quite boring and of little interest to people. Part of me knows that this is not true but I find myself getting trapped in that thought process.
 
So that brings us to tonight. After talking to a counsellor I was doing so well. Lie free and all me for a few months and it happened again. I screwed up. It was over such an insignificant thing. I took some money out of savings to see me through the weekend but it came up short so I took some more out and my partner questioned how I got some more money. Instead of saying I took more out I concocted a story about transferring spare money from accounts and using change. I stuck to it for a little bit (3-4 minutes) and eventually confessed to moving money from savings. I thought she would be mad about me not telling her (not true). So now I have hurt and upset her and I’ve washed all my progress down the drain.
 
Thanks for reading. Sorry about the formatting I’m on mobile.

Hi everyone,
Where to begin? Not really sure myself, I'm feeling like the walls are closing in on me and no matter how much push I give, they just keep closing in.

It kind of all started last year in earnest although I did have a stint on an SSNRI a few years ago. My sister's health declined over the year before she passed on a few months ago. It left me feeling pretty rubbish since there was a lot left unsaid. Everything was left on a sour note years prior. You see, I grew up in a rather closed group that shunned society. A few years ago I traded that social group to pursue University. I never went to school as a child, or even did home-school. I was a free-range child. The community was, it still is, close knit. Everyone helps each other, everything is a group effort. It is idyllic in many ways, however, there is a strong in and out group dynamic. One can't be inside the group and participate in general life activities. If you are outside the group you are avoided and shunned like a team traitor.

That's how I lost contact with my sister, by being an outsider. Information, as sparse as it was, arrived to me months later from family. There was also a push to bring me back into the fold by guilt tripping me. A ultimatum of sorts, come back and you can talk to your dying sister. This was all on the back of my final year at university. The academic pressure felt intense, but it was a reprieve, something to hide behind while the real pressure came from my family. I bounced from studying to drinking at night and playing a myriad of video games. I graduated, but I wasn't really ready to graduate. I wasn't ready for the job searching and interviewing. I was there at University to escape life, not to build to something more. It came to an end, my course, I graduated, and then I suddenly had nothing. I was standing with a piece of paper, and a desire to hide away. I struggled, I got a few interviews, but being depressed, I mumbled and fumbled. I was even told that I needed to speak more.

Now I am still here, still feeling the same, still hiding away behind anything from my family. Video games, news, political forums. Anything that can sink time in a day and keep the feels back. Now I am feeling tired, so tired of it. I feel angry as well, like I could do something dumb. Fantasies of white hot anger mixed with hours of spacing out watching the endless dance of YouTube videos about a myriad of asinine topics.

I'm drowning myself in pointless minutia to hide.

Hi,
Im a first time user and hope this can be of assistance to me.
I have been battling depression for a very long time, however I recently come close to self harm. I have been avoiding medication as I dont want to become reliant on it, however I have just bitten the bullet and asked my physiologist to recommend someting for me. I was just wondering if people have had good or bad experiences with their medication?
I am very nervous about commencing this type of treatment.
Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks

I’m looking to connect with someone who is experiencing the same things as Iam. Almost 3 weeks ago I had been feeling super dizzy and extreme fatigue, felt like there was an elephant on my chest and just super sad. I didn’t know what was going on, until I went to the doctors and told him I had been feeling but I didn’t have anything triggering why I had been feeling the way I had been feeling. He put it down to hormonal anxiety and depression, and a really bad side effect after coming of birth control. 
I’m on antidepressants which are helping heaps. And I’m just trying to get through each day.

Thank you to everyone who has posted on the thread: BPD person who needs a friend with knowledge of BPD. I have learnt so much about my diagnosis, just from reading this thread. I hadn't heard at all about mirroring (even though I've done lots of reading).....
I am wanting to mention a situation with a friend. Essentially, I am never sure if when I have a scenario going on with a friend, whether it is BPD, or if its that friend's behaviour. In most instances, I easily blame myself for things - and most of the time, there are ways that I could have behaved better. But yesterday, I started writing an email to a friend, to hopefully resolve our issues with each other.... after typing the email out, I realised that I didn't fully believe what i was typing. So I have not sent the email, because I want to sit with what are my real gut feelings. I have trouble processing matters.....
Situation is as follows: We've been friends for 23 years. I would consider this person, one of my inner circle. She has been having an affair with a married woman. I had asked her about this several times, just to enquire, because she seemed to be talking about this woman a lot; if it'd been more serious. And she said they'd been together 3-4 times. I didn't think much of it, not great to sleep with a married person; but whatever (I don't even know them)...... I then find out 18 months later (even though we speak a few times a week), that she has been in a full blown affair with this woman. I reacted by  talking about how the husband feels...and pulled myself away from the friendship..... In reflecting, I don't actually care about what the husband feels. For me, I felt rejected and why has she kept it quiet. It also frustrated me because I have supported her through 2 relationships where her partners had had affairs..... (and additionally, one other holiday I went on with her, she brang a ""friend""..... turns out it wasn't a friend....it was a lover).....  she thinks I judged her and that she isnt obliged to share things about her life with me. As a friend, it should be up to the person, to share what they want to share. The healthy and clear-thinking side of my brain thinks she is not taking responsibility. I don't know how to move forward and am distressed about it. 
Not sure how to move forward with the friendship.

How did I get to this place?  I am 63 years old and I am sad, I feel lonely and I guess depressed. I have started to see a therapist however my background is that I was always told by my peers that things happen along the way and you just deal with it and pick yourself back up and get on with it.  But nobody told me about ageing and loneliness.  I have a gorgeous family (who have put me through the wringers throughout the years, but have all bounced back and are healthy and reasonably happy) I have lovely friends as well.  But I am sad, just incredibly sad and crying right now.  I am normally in control but lately have felt more out of control than a bus with no breaks!  Does this ever pass?  One day I am OK one day I am sad and crying - actually most days lately.  I feel like I don't want to go out - I don't want to put on a happy face - I don't want to see other peeps and families out being happy.  Maybe I am just being a selfish human? Thanks for listening.

Just got some news not long ago that the grandma I’m closest to is showing signs both my grandfathers showed/acted like 2 days before they passed away since yesterday so if that’s the case she might not be with us by the weekend. So I’m feeling kind of down and I’m don’t know how I’ll cope if I lose my grandma as even if she lived 1 1/2 hours away as I was growing up I was very close with her and would go to see her quite often or it felt like it was most weekends. All I want and have done so far is when I’m very upset is turning to food and anything fattening which is my coping mechanism 😭

Hi ALl ive been medicated for the last 5 years for major depressive disorder, never had much luck in finding one that works for me. My latest cocktail consists of 2 meds one which was added more recently and has caused me to gain 7kg, my weight has always played a massive role in my mental health, ive had body image issues from as a young girl and my life has revolved around on trying to always be skinnier than i was last week, i know this may silly to som but it has always played a big role on determining my state of mind and happiness sadly 😿... i cant stay on this medication any longer as the fear of continuing to keep gaining weight scares the living hell out of me. Anyone had any experience with this? Im seeing my gp Monday so was going to mention it but would luv to hear anyones thoughts.
thank u all kindly 🙏

I hate weekends. When families are out enjoying time with their family and friends, experiencing life. My kids and i are at home, they on their tablets watching some mind numbing thing while their childhoods drift away. 
I cant give them the life they deserve. Theres only so many times you can take them to the playground before it gets boring. I just want them to beable to look back on their childhoods with fond memories and so far all they have is mum who is basically forever crying and a dad who is never about. 
i cant even find a job to try and improve our financial situation. Just knock back after knock back and reiterating the fact im not good enough for anyone despite me really wanting to make anything work. 
I just want out of this entire situation.

so i’ve just started year 11- like, JUST started. it’s my third week back and i already feel like i’m drowning. i cant go one day without completely breaking down because i just can’t deal with it. i used to love school, but now i just feel so nervous there and i don’t have anyone that i can talk to. i feel alone around people i used to be close with, and i have no friends now because i just keep isolating myself. i haven’t been to a councillor because i can’t bring it upon myself to speak up when i’m struggling and ask for help. i was suspended last year because the school didn’t think i was in the right headspace to come back until i had seen a psychiatrist, but i only ever went to a doctor who referred me to someone- who i never went to. i’m just in a really bad place, i’ve already missed three days of school and will probably skip more. i don’t know what to do anymore, i already have so much homework but all i can do when i get home is sleep, cry, stare into nothing then wonder where all the time went. when i try to do homework i procrastinate- then get into trouble for not doing homework. i’ve lost all interest, even in the subjects that i was so keen to do. i constantly wish that i moved schools and beat myself up for not knowing how to ask for help. everything just feels so difficult and i don’t know how i’m going to get through two more years of this.

Hi everyone,
I'm only just working up the courage to say what I'm dealing with. Having read lots of posts over the last few days from people in much worse situations I can't help but feel like a whinging brat, but at the same time I am very tired of keeping everything to myself and things don't seem to be getting better. 
I'm a 20yo old uni student, living away from home, completing an arts degree in music performance. I come from a stable and supportive family, no traumatic events, decent friendships from an early age that I still maintain. Hell, I don't even have to work during my degree thanks to scholarships and money from my parents. Objectively quite an enviable life. So what's the issue? Pretty much everything + depression. Oh, I also have T1DM which sucks.
 I'm very homesick and miss my family - but if I stay at home nothing improves, I stagnate. 
I have lots of acquaintances, very few friends, and at the moment I'd say no close friends. I feel that the more people know me, the less they come to like me. So I'll just keep it brief and say I struggle with forming intimate connections with people, and I blame no one but myself for that.
I generally have a pessimistic world view. Not so much that we're all doomed, but rather that we are powerless to dismantle the structures that perpetuate injustices, and that in order to do so would cause even more harm in the short term. Moreover, I see so many smart and politically engaged people with absolutely no interest in understanding the other side of the debate. Everyone is polarised.  
I see no meaning in life on an existential level. I am not religious and my life philosophy is probably one of hedonism at the moment. Yet at the same time my depression and social ineptitude mean that I cannot even explore that. 
As for uni, whilst I find playing and listening to music enormously helpful, the highly competitive environment and heavy practical workload is not healthy for me. I feel mediocre at best in comparison to my peers, and despite lots of focused effort to better myself the progress feels negligible.
Of late, I have come to drink a LOT of alcohol. Binge drinking several times a week, normally on my own. I don't fully understand why, but I feel it 'dumbs me down' to a point where I can actually relate with other people (and oh yes I know how pretentious that sounds and hate myself for it!). Alcohol, music, and my cat at home, are the only things that I feel bring me genuine pleasure.

Over the last 5 months Ive been through absolute hell. I found out on the 8th of October that I had fallen pregnant with a very much wanted and planned baby. A week later I had a bleed along with high fevers that we were told there was a hematoma (tumour/clot) next to the baby. Three days later I was in emergency surgery for appendicitis. It then turned out my appendix was full of cancer. I had to have a major bowel reconstruction surgery while 12 weeks pregnant. After my operation my lower body shut down and I went into the shock and was uncontrollably vomitting to the point the hospital couldn't help me. On top of all of this I have Hypermesis Gravidarum. Im so freaking depressed and I am struggling to continue wanting this baby. I try to tell me family that there are so many days that I can't get off the couch and they just tell me to pull myself together and get on with it. I've got a toddler to care for as well and most days I barely have the energy to take proper care of him never mind the whole house and hubby too. It's no bloody wonder so many people just give up 😭 I've got a psychology appointment tomorrow with my birthing hospital and I'm so bloody desperate for it to help 😭

Hi guys, 
About 2 months ago my ex and I broke up. At the time, he said that his mental health was not in the best shape and he needed time to work on himself. He suffers from clinical depression, at the time of the end of our relationship he was very closed off and wasn't really talking to me about what was going on. The main driver of our breakup was this and long distance. I don't know if he was taking his medication. The breakup has been immensely hard on me, and my own mental health has been struggling too. Since the breakup, I tried to reach out to him a few times but he ignored or left me on read for everything I said, so I figured it would be best if I stopped. He hasn't said anything to me since the breakup, the last time I tried to speak to him was 2 weeks ago. 
I noticed today that he has deleted his Facebook, I'm a bit worried that he could be going through something and feeling alone/ struggling, especially given the context of our last conversation, I don't know what I can do to help seeing as he's made it clear (through his silence) that he probably doesn't want anything to do with me, but I feel awful about the prospect of him suffering through something alone and feeling like noone cares for him. What can I do if I'm worried about him? I don't want my presence in his life to upset him anymore, and I don't know if my own mental health could cope with another rejection right now. Maybe he deleted his FB for a totally unrelated reason but I just have a bad feeling.
Thank you for reading

Hi I'm new here. I wasn't sure whether to post this in the anxiety or depression section because I'm not sure what to think of what I'm going through.

Ive been struggling with anxiety, depression, obsessive thoughts since 2013 when I was in highschool. Back tjen it was health anxiety that was quite bad but I got through it. I'm a 21 year old girl now. I would have issues coming and going with my mental health since I graduated high school in 2016 but I could cope with everything. But at the start ot this year I relapsed hard with anxiety and depression. Now for the past week seemingly out of nowhere I've just sunken to what feels like the lowest point Ive ever been at. I'm not sure what triggered this thought pattern but for nearly a week now (feels like an eternity) I can't stop obsessing over death. I keep playing over and over in my head the fact that I will die one day and theres nothing I can do about it. Its the thought of me no longer existing which is really getting me panicking and also the worst depression I have ever felt. I feel like this is just who I am now. I can't imagine breaking this cycle and stopping thinking about my own mortality.. my brain turns everything into my eventual death. 

I'm at the point where I've basically lost all motivation to do anything. All I want to do is sit and cry all day because I'm going to die one day. I feel nausea constantly and I've lost most of my motivation to even take care of myself. Is there a way out of this? How do I stop fearing and being depressed over my eventual demise? As far as I'm aware I dont have any diseases currently that will shorten my lifespan but this doesnt ease my mind at all...

Hi guys. First time poster, long time sufferer of depression and anxiety  (10 years).

I find myself lost. I'm about to turn 38 and due to injuries and a body that it aging at a very fast rate, I no longer have the ability to do the things I love. So, I've lost my ""escape"" or my ""happy place""

I have played rugby league my whole life, finally gave it away at 36. That was winter sorted. For summer, it was water skiing/wakeboarding. 
My wife and I recently packed up our lives and moved from Canberra to Toowoomba, so not knowing anyone up here and the costs of owning a ski boat, we sold the boat 12 months ago.

Due to shortage of money, I have found it very difficult to find ""something to do"". My wife owns 2 horses, so she has her happy place. I enjoy camping, but it's not something I'm able to do all the time (work some Saturdays, chores at home, lack of money).

Getting old sucks!

My question is to people that have played/enjoyed sport their whole lives, what did you do when the sport stopped???

I've tried photography. Which I enjoy, but it's not overly fun/exciting.

I used to be good at going out and meeting people, but my anxiety has put a stop to that. 

Any help/feedback/suggestions woukd be very much appreciated!!

Not sure how to start but here goes... I have been living with depression
For over 20 years. Also in early 1990s was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
I never really took it serious until recently when i was put on cholesterol
Tablets for life. It was a shock but also a wake up call.  I know I have
To lose weight etc but am finding it hard.  My motivation in all things in life
Has been low. How does one get motivated? Am aware of health risks as have
Eye issues too. Any suggestions on getting started?  I guess am just lazy but
Need to change but I take the easy way out and avoid issues.

I haven't spoken to anyone about this. I'm not sure where to start. So my college finals are in a month & I can't get myself to study. I've been staying at home for the past 20 days but I hardly study. I either do stuff that lets me ignore my real life like movies, YouTube & music or do nothing (literally I can sit on my bed for 4 hours and stare at the wall). I keep telling myself to go study but that just can't even move and open the book. All of a sudden I breakdown and start sobbing. I start thinking about everything wrong with my life and that can go wrong if i continue to be like this. But I can't motivate myself (may be I'm not trying hard I don't know). I sleep at 3 am and get up at 10 am. I've been lying to my parents that I'm studying all night when I just lay in bed all night doing nothing or crying. In the first year of college I wasted a lot of time and ended up getting through a minimal percentage. Since then I've been like this. I was one of the top students in class till 12th grade. I don't know what happened when I entered college. Now I feel like I'm not as smart as I once was. I used to love studying alone. But nowadays I can't think straight when I' m alone. So I study with my friends sometimes. Only then I can be productive. I feel so guilty that I'm wasting my parents money. Sometimes when I'm driving I wish something would come and hit me so I don't have to deal with this anymore. All of a sudden I get happy and positive out of nowhere and I'll start studying... then 15 min into it negative thoughts set in. And I just leave everything (I don't even bother to close the book) and sit or sleep on my bed and listen to music or browse the internet or sleep or cry. Then I get physically incapable of moving out of my bed, I just stare at the books making mental study plans which I never accomplish (I don't even get close and change the plan the following day). I'm so angry at myself and everyone that I get angry at my parents for no good reason. If they ask me, I say I'm ok. I feel really guilty. I'm the worst daughter ever and don't deserve anything they do for me. They are such nice people. They probably would be better off without me. I'm a disappointment and shame to my parents. I'm a loser. I'm not the kind of person who would physically hurt myself. If I am, may be I probably would have done something of that sort by now. Deep inside I still have hope that 'everything will be ok"". I want to be normal and happy :(   I' m so lostbeyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi there,
This is the first time i've done this, so i'm a little new to this!
I think i've always been this way; melancholy, quiet, easily distracted, vague but cheerful. I'm happy when i'm making things. But i distinctly remember these feelings, my extreme sensitivity and shyness, coming out when i hit puberty. My tears come with no warning, and have been for years, and can be quite inconsolable. My lack of drive to speak to my friends and my family coupled with a strange tiredness is exhausting. The worst part is that i'm scared this is going to be the rest of my life, just like holding my breath. 
At the age of 23, I'm wasting what should be happy, careless and fulfilling years. 
Thanks for reading

This is my story... 
My ex partner decided to end the relationship a week before Xmas without any explanation. We were meant to be getting married & starting a family this year. My dreams were taken away from me..
I have no family in the city I’m currently living in which makes me feel even more alone. 
I don’t sleep or eat well. I have started seeing a therapist but I just struggle to open up. 
How to move on ??

Hi, I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (bipolar/depression) and am currently suffering from a depressive episode. I don’t want to admit it to anyone but I think it’s really due to a 25kg weight gain in just over a year. I use to be such an athletic girl and have started to gain so much weight because of my medication, well that’s at least what I believe. I don’t know what to do. Only my GP believes it’s due to the medication where my psychiatrist doesn’t. If I was taking the medication as a tablet there is no doubt I would have stopped it by now but I actually have it as a monthly injection. I’m thinking about stopping it and telling my family I am still doing it which I know is bad but this weight gain is becoming debilitating. How should I approach asking to change medications, and convincing my family it’s actually because of the medication and not other factors like exercise and food habits? I am so upset I am questioning my diagnosis so I can convince myself to stop the medication which has helped me so much, I feel so lost.

My husband quit drinking about 8weeks ago. He was hitting the alcohol really hard and I begged him to stop. He did. He suffered from regular bouts of depression after the birth of each of our children. But our last baby I thought we might of been in the clear as we’ve been going good. But it seems this has come out of no where. He yelled at my son( his stepson last weekend and called him a name) I stepped in and then he said he will not live with him he wOuld rather die. And then we argued. The next day he slept all day and night. He’s this weekend slept all day and night and does not want to talk to me about it. I may be doing the wrong thing , I keep telling him how much he means to me and the children, how much I love him. And he says he does not want to love and that I will move on😭 together we have 3 kids and 3 step kids. I asked him to get treatment as we need him and want him happy. He has outright refused to see a doctor, or get help. He says he just wants it all to end. What do I do . I’m lost this is consuming all of me I love this man with all my heart how can I help him? I can’t get him to get help I’m so scared that he will suicide im lost. I find myself getting angry ( I know I shouldn’t) as I can’t understand why we don’t make him happy? I’d appreciate any advice

I have bipolar 1 with mixed states. Hospitalised for the first time and my husband announced whilst I was resident in a mental ward that he was leaving me. My brain got fried from extended mania so it took a month for it to dawn on me, the reality of being seperated. I’m exercising and taking the meds, and doing everything I’m supposed to do. How do you adjust to a marriage break up safely with bipolar 1?

I find little reason to live, apart from my family who lives across the globe. I was lying on my bed, trying to escape this. Forced myself to sleep, and woke up an hour later. I remember waking up feeling so sad, so lost, so empty. I dread tomorrow. Some day I slept all the time, but day like this, I could not sleep, even afraid of having a good dream, being happy in my dream, but waking up with nothing. 
I am a PhD student, who used to love what I did so much. But the job I once love becomes dreadful. I call myself worthless in my head a few times a day. It got better, then it got worse, way worse, then repeat. Counselling does not help. Or it helps, but I ruin it.  I am not sure anymore. What if it would be like this for the rest of my life.

I’ve lived with depression & anxiety for a number of years now, but recently the depression has really taken hold over the past few weeks.
i haven’t gone to work for 3 weeks, I sleep most of the day, I’ve lost my appetite & I have no motivation to do anything. The only times I have left the house is for doctor appointments.
i am in regular contact with my psychologist. 
I’ve seen the GP in the last 2 weeks, first time we did a mental health assessment & she upped my medication. I went again last Friday so she could check how I was going. She did another mental health has also given me a referral for a psychiatrist as feels they will be better paced to assess & prescribe appropriate medication. She also gave me some phone numbers to call if I needed to speak to someone. I contacted the psychiatrist’s office & emailed the referral through last Friday & still waiting for them to get back to me.
So I’ve spoken to my GP, had appointments both in person & over the phone with the psychologist, have told my boyfriend how I am feeling & even told it all to my work team leader & manager.  I also told my best friend & posted here.
But I still feel lost. Nothing is changing or improving. I don’t know where else to turn. It’s been really difficult but I feel like I’ve really tried with reaching out to people. I just feel like there is no one else to reach out to but it doesn’t feel like I am getting the help I really need.
Any advice?

I’m not really sure where to start but amongst a whole heap of family issues I’ve been dealing with a partner with a quite severe gambling and pot addiction as well as anxiety and depression. I’m at a point now where I feel I am depressed. We are at a point now where we face loosing our house, car, everything really. Our electricity will be cut off soon and probably our phones. And I just thought to myself how nice it must be to not actually care. He seems to cruise through life through life not caring. So long as he has pot and poker machines in his life all else can go to hell apparently?? I’m almost positive he went with me to the counsellor simply to appease me when I said I thought he needed help. I’m finding it all somewhat beyond my control now and am completely lost. I’ve sought medical help locally but a pat on the back from your GP and a “ there there” is just not good enough. I never expected to come away with a List of prescriptions as long as my arm but I certainly expected more than I got. Where the hell can we go. We have no finances to pay large sums of money to professionals so I am very very lost.

Hi All,
I've been working with my psych recently on my ""big emotions"" and trying to learn how to allow my emotions to be felt and heard, but not acted upon. Has anyone here done something similar? 
I am struggling to grasp how to let an emotion be without acting on it. Isn't everything we do acting on emotions? I know there is logical thinking too, but emotions always seem to play a part for me. 
To give some context, I've been struggling a lot with overwhelming feelings, getting stuck in the ditch of depression and finding that I don't want to get out of it. I go from living in a state of panic and anxiety, to hiding in the big black hole of depression where I don't feel anything. So my psych has been trying to work with me to learn how to ""not be afraid of my big emotions"". Because I tend to get very big emotions - If I feel happy, I feel REALLY happy, if I'm sad, I'm REALLY sad, Anxious - Extremely anxious, etc etc etc. you get the picture. 
How do you go by when the feelings that come up feel SO overpowering? If I feel jealous, the only way to move past it is by distraction, but there's only so many ways I can distract myself! If I feel sad, I have to try and distract myself until the mood passes but again, sometimes I can't distract myself. So how does one deal with big emotions? Am I an abnormality here?

Kinda funny kinda not but today got a display of my low frustration tolerance, ha I find those self service machines at the supermarket a pain, I seem to put my shopping in the wrong area and then someones gotta come over and fix it, but i was thinking these have annoyed me for a while but I gotta learn to slow down and learn the process its probably the supermarket environment aswell not always great for people with anxiety at times. Anyone else share this grievance haha ? I''ll be practising my mindfullness with the machines or just using the old style checkout.

I was just wondering if anyone else on here can't sleep because of their depression? Sometimes I stay up until 4 or 5 in the morning because I feel like a sad, lonely, depressed loser. Actually to be honest I've never been able to sleep until the early hours of the morning for over a decade now. I used to take circadin but my body got so used to it that it didn't work and I was still awake 6 or 7 hours after taking it.

I just wanted to say that my first post from a couple of weeks ago will tell you more about what I'm going through at the moment, if anyone wants to read it. It's on the suicidal thoughts thread, not this one (Just thoight I'd clarify that)

Also, has anybody got any tips on how to get to sleep earlier? I always feel depressed from midnight onwards when I'm lying in bed and I would rather be fast asleep than have these stupid thoughts swirling around my head.

Hi Im new to hear and apologies If this in the wrong section 
About 3 weeks ago my girlfriend of a year and a half ended it out of no where over text and said she needs to work on herself. She has been going through alot at home and not knowing what to do this year ( as she has finished year 12). We very rarely had arguments, so I was surprised why she ended it out of no where we have had very little contact over text or calling and she always seems blunt and out of it. I feel like im getting a different response why each time first it was to work on herself and now its that she was bad for me (at no point in our relationship was it toxic) Ive told her I wanna help and support her and I understand that she needs her space, but I feel like she's just ignoring me 
Im writing this to ask for some advice on what to do in this situation and also is it her talking or the depression saying she was not good for me and how can someone change so much pretty much over night?
Apologies for any bad grammar or spelling 
Thanks in advance Van

G'day all,
I was finally diagnosed with BPD 2 in 2009 after having a 'breakdown' during my career in Politics back in August 2004. Initially I was diagnosed and being treated for depression but after 5 years of getting nowhere and feeling worse rather than better I decided to take the bull by the horns and demanded that my GP organise a Mental Healthcare Plan and send me of to see a Psychologist. It was during my 2nd session, my Psychologist advised me that I didn't have Depression but rather a mood disorder called Bipolar and that I needed to see a Psychiatrist pretty quickly. That was in November 2008. I saw a Psychiatrist in Jan 2009 and he confirmed the diagnosis of BPD 2.
Since then I've been in and out of both the Public and Private Mental Healthcare hospitals 14 times the last was in October 2019 after I decided to stop all my BPD medication as it wasn't working and I was sick and tired of putting all that poison down my throat. I spent 3 weeks in the private clinic, meds free and was discharged medication free on the Tuesday. I contacted my Psych on the Wednesday as my mood was again cycling and I was extremely angry and aggressive toward my wife. My Psych had me see him on the Friday and started me on a medication starting that lunchtime. Saturday morning I woke with my heart trying to jump through my chest and profusely sweating. Thought I was having a heart attack. My daughter took me to the local Public Hospital where I was admitted straight away into Critical Care and then that night into Coronary Care. On the Sunday morning before I was fully awake the nurse came along and jabbed me in the stomach with a blood thinner injection and then returned with a cup full of medications for my apparent heart condition. I had not seen a Doctor since my arrival on this ward so how did they know I had a heart condition? I refused to take the meds and was then eventually seen by the Cardiac Specialist who told me that I could go home as I only had a reaction to the medication. Why did they try to force me into taking all those other pills? What could they have done to me?
Have tried remaining med free but no good. Got the angries and the cycling back. Now I'm on a different medication and things have calmed down just a bit. At least my heart isn't trying to jump out of my chest.
Sometimes you just need to stand up for yourself and say enough is enough. I've had far too much of your poison. Being med free worked for a while but is not the full answer
Enjoy life

Hello all,
I am new here so apologies if this situation has been covered before. I am no stranger to anxiety and depression however and neither is my ex boyfriend who I have been forced to continue living with due to our lease for the last three months after he ended our 3+ year relationship. 
There were many factors and valid reasons for him to end it. I accept that now and aspects of his life he has to learn to deal with himself separate to me. What concerns me is (in a nutshell) he’s had ongoing problems keeping jobs due to many different circumstance and as a result I was the sole breadwinner (it happens). It went on in this cycle for almost 2 years. During which he encouraged me to find my current psych and stay on the meds during tough times. He was my cheerleader and biggest support system but due to his lack of finances put his own mental health on the back burner as much as I tried to encourage him to seek assistance.
Now, many awkward and emotional arguments later I am moving out of the house we shared together as the lease is coming to an end and he triggered my anxiety very badly when he repeatedly brought his new partner over to the house when I wasn’t there and shoved the new “relationship” in my face. It made me physically sick I was so anxious. I begged him to respect my boundaries. That’s over now but the damage is done. My boundaries weren’t respected.
He had told me to move out of the house (as I had the funds to and cause the house was perfect for him and his young daughter) so with the encouragement of his friends I am.
Why I am here today however is he is now starting down the barrel of no new job, owes me a great deal of money and won’t be able to afford the rent on his own so now needs to move out himself. He has a new partner that he saw after finding out he didn’t get the job he hoped would save him and came home and yelled at me that I am to blame for “putting him in this situation” which of course I didn’t and don’t take personally and demanded he will not pay me a cent back till he pays back others who are helping him out now. 
He’s drinking every day. An unhealthy amount and I know it’s best for me to leave - for both of our sakes and mental health but I worry he’s not getting the help he needs. Blaming others for his situation is a bad sign and I know you can’t help someone who doesn’t want help and it’s best for me to not engage with that behaviour but is there anything else I could do that won’t trigger him to help?

hey there,
i made this thread for people who can go through day to day life and get out of bed but still feel empty and sad or just numb/tired/done or anything like that.
depression obviously comes in a lot of different forms but those of you with mild or moderate depression that mostly affects your mental world/motivations/outlook rather than taking a severe toll on your daily requirements are still so extremely valid and deserve as much support and love as you need.
please feel free to talk about any of your experiences/feelings here, open to anyone
love you all 💛

Hi all,


I’m new here, nice to meet everyone.


I figured I’d come here to lay out my thoughts and story as my anxiety and depression has been plaguing me for years and in the past two years, it has affected a lot quite directly. I don’t even know where to start because there’s a lot but I’ll do the best I can.  Basically, one of the main factors of this is I’m 31 - for pretty much all of my twenties, I’ve avoided committing to long term relationships for having been hurt in the past and through fear of not being good enough for someone. For a number of factors. I’ve always generally had some kind of anxiety - I’m very much an introverted extrovert. I have a lot of friends but I’m still somewhat quiet and different from some of my peers and especially my immediate family. Although, I feel like I seem to have inherited anxiety from my parents - my Mum is not the most confident and my Dad is depressed and just not the same kind of person since having been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 18 years ago. There’s things I hate about myself - I’m 31 and I don’t have a full driving license which some people think is weird/pathetic. A bit of a trivial thing but it matters to me. I’m actually so afraid of not doing something correctly on the road that I’ve had panic attacks on the road during tests and lessons and have spent so much money on this only to fail over and over again. I’m not from a lucrative background - for lack of a better term, my family are quite poor and for a while I was basically the breadwinner as I was the only one in the family with a job. Hence once of the reasons why I still can’t drive because I could never afford it until later in life (which doesn’t matter anyway as I keep failing).

Hey,
Not sure where this fits.  But I found out last year I tested positive for ADHD, no one will tell me for sure if I have it.  But i'm pretty convinced I do.  Lately it's been super hard to focus too, and if I've had it then I've had it my whole life, but lately it's just super hard to focus.
I keep going to get junk food, or abuse the internet, other times I have stuff to do but couldn't be motivated to do it even though I'm trying really hard.  I just went through a break up and I can't help but crave something or feel empty and sad.
When I found out at first it crashed my world cause I realized that all the shite things I've done in the past that I blamed myself for, weren't even my fault and I feel like if I'd known sooner I could have avoided a lot of heart ache.  I kinda wish that when it was flagged when I was a kid that it wasn't shoved under the rug like it was.  That feels unfair to my parents though because I know they did their best - but I do wish that I'd been able to use my past years better.
I guess at the moment i'm scared cause I dont know where to go from here, once I move out of the house my ex and I live in, i'm gonna be on my own.  I've never been on my own, (ive always gone partner to partner) and eventually i'm gonna quit my job to go study to change careers...  how can I even trust my decisions anymore considering how corrupted by this possible disorder they've been in the past? Like how do you know your doing the right thing with adhd or if its just another novel idea?
Anyone got experience with this?
Thanks,
Suisse

Hi, I don’t know if anyone else has issues with losing friends and family over their Behaviour or personality? I’m unsure as idk who I am anymore. I feel like there seems to be something wrong with me. I can’t keep people in my life. I always say or do the wrong things. If I try and be someone I think people want me to be it doesn’t work and if I open up and show my true self I seem to get the same reaction. I’m unsure what to do and I’m at the point I’ve lost most people around me. I’m at a loss atm. I have a wonderful partner but I wonder how long it will be before I ruin that too. Help?

Hey all,
I introduced myself a little while back and this is my first proper post. I wasn't really sure where to put in it or what to say, I just know I'm feeling pretty down and last time sharing helped a bit. I was diagnosed with anxiety at the start of the year and the whole 12 months has been spent trying to best manage and respond to this while also living my life. I'm so stubborn and whether it is a good thing or not I went to work each day, shared with others what was going on and got help from the expected sources. I have depression now too, intermittently, I think it came about as just being so tired and sick of everything going wrong despite how hard I tried. 
Ultimately I didn't think it would be nearly 2020 and I'd be still feeling awful and still wondering 'can I' or 'can't I' have a good day, live my life, put the things other people to do behind me or even if I'm lucky, sleep. I'm still stubborn and I still want so badly to try and get through this and enjoy all the wonderful things. This year I've come to realise anxiety has always been a part of my life, but the depression somehow scares me more though that doesn't really make sense. Anyway, enough rambling, is it possible that 2020 could be better?
I appreciate knowing that others understand. It helps just to write and read sometimes I think

Hello community!
Overview: for last year i had big anxiety spikes out of blue. Now i came to realisation those anxiety spikes come when i become hyperactive, i start questioning myself why i m feeling that way and anxiety hits. I m using medication for 3months to help with my anxiety but paradoxically it helped me only 1-2weeks after i started taking it. For past month i keep log of how i feel and realised my mood radically changes from hyperactive to very tired, this usually happens 2 times in a day. For example today i got up in the morning after 12 hours of sleeping with racing thoughts (without anxiety) i became hyperactive i did insane amount of jobs feeling euphoria, guilt, fear at the same time this mood hit its peak and i lost all my energy and feel literaly like used napkin. In few days im visiting my psychiatrist and gonna tell everything that happens with me. This would seem to me like bipolar but there is that thing when i feel elated and sad at the same time, also moods shift few times in same day. When i say hyperactive i mean my mind is racing like insane, i cant stand still, if im hyperactive at work my collegues tell me to slowdown but i simply cant. Do you guys maybe have insight what is happening with me? I m really wrecked up...

Hey,
I need a question answered.
Can I request some type of psychological report from my psychologist to give to me, my lawyer or my GP?
I’m Australian and was injured in a workplace accident exactly one year today in Canada whilst on a working visa. 

My previous psychologist, told me she would document everything I’m going through in regards to the trauma I sustained. She told me I was exhibiting PTSD.
I didn’t find her very helpful though.. and decided it would be best not to see her anymore.
I emailed her asking for her to contact my lawyers to send them a report like she said she would.
She called me to say that she could not write any reports as there is a “jurisdictional issue” however she knew all this time it happened overseas.

She fed me some rubbish that she would contact her lawyers and find out if she could but she was pretty sure she can’t and would contact me back.
Also told me the psychologist company she worked for did not want to be associated with this?
Surprise surprise, she never contacted me back, she won’t open or respond to any of my emails. 

I feel she has just made things worse for me. She is jeopardising my claim
too.
My lawyers in Canada are asking for this report. I don’t know what to say to them.
 What do I say my psychologist refuses to provide you with the report.
I am doing CPT for PTSD with another psychologist, so I will be asking them if they can send something to my lawyers. 

I just really need the first psychologist I was seeing to send this report Tommy layers.
Any information would be helpful?

I hate my brain, I hate having Bipolar and I hate the fact that this mental illness will be with me for as long as I live.
I hate being over sensitive.
I hate that I over react.
I hate that I feel things much deeply than most people.
I just hate my brain and wish sometimes it would just all stop.
Today and for the past few weeks my anxiety has escalated. It's triggered the 'irritability' associated with my Bipolar.
That's the professional term. Iritability, it's such an understatement. It's more like anger and pure rage, that's so difficult to control, you try and keep it to yourself, it's not fair on others. Then your partner says some thing that upsets you, any normal person would shrug it off. It wasn't meant the way it sounded it your head. Then it circles in your brain over and over in your head, slowly becoming this big thing, the next thing you know, you're over reacting you're lashing out at him and being horrid and agressive, all because your stupid brain made some thing out of nothing.
This is the reality of irritability with Bipolar for me.
Today sucked usually I keep it contained better, some days I can talk myself through it, today wasn't one of those. Today was a bad day.
It's not something I am proud of, I'm deeply ashamed of this facet of my personality, something that until just now I realise, I'm so ashamed that I've never told my Dr about this 'dark side' of me. Clearly that needs to change. I need to mention it.
Thanks for just letting vent and get it out.

I’m 20, have sever depression and anxiety, usually I can cope pretty well and I can always help others with their own issues and problems but with me I don’t know what to do
my sister is 4 years older. Successful. I’m the opposite. every job I lose interest in or get too depressed or anxious to go and end up quitting or getting fired. 
I don’t know what job to apply for or course to study. Nothing interests me and idk what to do, I hate being 20 and having no future, I have no money so I’m just costing money and I’m stuck in this endless cycle of going nowhere in life.
i want to work, really I do. I want to have my own house and have money and have a future but no matter how hard I try I just can’t stick with it or something goes wrong and I end up right where I started. 
everyone says study something but I’ve looked at every course and I’m not interested, I work in hospitality but I’m too anxious to go to work. I’ve tried other places and it’s the same thing. 
I have no qualifications, a year 10 pass. Maybe. I don’t actually know if I completed year 10 because I missed the last few weeks. That’s it. What do I do? Where do I go? Honestly it’s like I wasn’t meant to be here.
I wanted to study youth councilling which sounds ridiculous because I have depression but I can’t even do that without a year 12 pass and because I might not even have year 10 I don’t want to have to go back to school, at 20 and be in a class with a bunch of 15-16 year olds. 
what do I do?

Hi there, I’ve been struggling for a while mostly in denial about my wife’s condition. She has extreme mood swings which I have asked her to seek medical advice about as they are more changes of personality. Over the last year she has been drinking in secret, hiding bottles of wine in cupboards and this has progressed to hiding it in sports bottles. I have caught her a few times and she blames me for everything. I cannot talk to her when she has been drinking as the words that she says are too hurtful. I gave up all drink in an attempt to help her stop, we were good for two weeks then I found her drinking in the bedroom. She admits she is depressed and blames me, because we had three kids and she gave up her career and independence. 
If we didn’t have kids, I would walk away, but I don’t trust her with the children, especially as she drinks in secret. I have asked her to get help, she always finds and excuse, and how can I prove she is getting help? 
my work is highly stressful and I am juggling trying to keep my family together and not make a mistake at work. 
Do I involve her family? Do I ask her to leave? I want to help her, as I still love her and I don’t want to split my family. I feel I am slowly breaking and finding it hard to keep smiling for my children. 
I don’t know what to do.

Too often I feel inexplicably sad and empty, but I never let anyone see it. I always put myself out into the world as a bright bubbly person, I work as a receptionist in a gym so it’s all about keeping others happy. I feel like there’s no reason at all for me to feel like I do most of the time, and I’ve never been to see anyone about it. I don’t want to feel like I’m wasting someone’s time or even spending money on an appointment that I didn’t need because I’m making it all up. I’ve had friends with really bad depression, and it makes me question if I’m just sad sometimes, like I don’t even have it as bad as others. I’ve seen this friend become too reliant on our friends and seen how many friendships she’s lost from being so hard to deal with, I don’t want to be that. I don’t even know if this makes sense.

I am a 55 year old woman and I believe I have been depressed my whole life. Unfortunately the last year its become so severe - with heart palpitations, loss of interest in anything at all, avoidance of any activities- overwhelming tiredness and lots of sleeping but no relief and feeling almost too tired to walk. I try to put on a fake face all day - accept all the rejection I have my whole life - from everyone and I'm just at the lowest feeling ever. I previously took a medication which was okay but I am just seeing if anyone feels the same. I feel so alone and after years of rejection- chronic low self esteem - old age symptoms making that worse - as every day I look at an old tired face, I'm almost giving up and need some relief from the sadness to try to find some peace

Hi first time poster here. I have had depression since I was 16 am now 54 years old. Have been on medication since I was 20 but depressive feelings have always lurked in the background. But for the last 3 years or so it has been worse, resulting in feelings of anxiety and now social anxiety...I dont want to go out and socialise....I am ok at work but not with being out in a situation where I have to chat to people and make small talk. I feel everyone is judging me and I find no enjoyment in anything really. I have a wonderful husband but try and hide my feelings of despair from everyone as I dont want to make others feel bad. This includes immediate family. I dont have many friends as I am just not interested in staying in contact with people.I dont really have any time to myself as my parents live with us 6 months of the year and I feel I have to be oh so happy and normal when I am home...but all I want to do is curl up in a ball and avoid everyone. Sleep used to be a saviour but now I am experiencing insomnia. I was wondering whether other women at peri menopausal/menopausal age has found their depression/anxiety has worsened? I feel like a shit mother to my 2 younger girls still living at home (11 and 17) because I am no fun and dont want to go anywhere with them. Christmas has been a nightmare. My gp has left the practice and I have to try and find a new one whom I can relate to.

Hey first time doing this online. I have seen a professional in the past though.
so I just wanted to share my story and see if anyone else thinks they know what Steps I should Take.
so I’m 26 and have had my first Child a little over a year ago. before having Him I suffered from depression going through a rough break up and had a tough time finding myself.
i’m super happy to become a dad but the stress and being secluded from seeing my friends and sometimes family caused me to slowly fall into a depression and bad habits of drinking And smoking.
after issues in my relationship . my partner gave me an ultimatum and said that I need to seek help and try to get out of my depression as she couldn’t be around it any more.
I tried making small adjustments but didn’t seek help thinking that I could slowly get out of depression but I still didn’t feel like myself and still feel alone and anxious and still drink and smoke when I told my partner I would quit smoking.
it has now come to a point where my partner has given me one last chance and told me to get help or I will lose our small family.
Long story short. here I am

Hi All

I'm new to this....umm ok.
6yrs ago I found partner in shed. We have 2 daughters.
Now 20 and 19.
My now 19yr old currently lives with my parents.
She did yr 8 then everything for her went haywire. 4yr mental health rollercoaster.
She has now been diagnosed BPD. Unfortunately the reason  living away was very bas communication and reactions.
She told me almost a yr ago she was a boy....my response was ok, but I can't change over night to call you by a different name ect. It was going to take time. Time was not of essence sadly.
We started to slowly make amends but things have flared and I don't know how to cope. I'm in breakdown mode. It effects every one around. I've chose to step aside and limit contact even with my parents but it didn't work....I'm Losing my daughter and my parents. Lost.

Hi,
I am new here and not really sure what to write, but after reading through so many of the posts I felt like this may be a good place to start. 3 weeks ago I got out of hospital after being in over Christmas for 10 days with meningitis, I am definitely not recovered but am so much better than I was physically. However, am so much worse mentally! I have been in Australia now for 9 months, initially only for 6 months but met my partner after being here 2 months, so i decided to stay until the end of my years visa with the plan that we would apply for a defacto visa. I went home in October for 4 weeks, where I had a bit of a mental breakdown and self-harmed. I have a long history with depression, starting when I was a child with my parents and emotional abuse, then followed by emotional abusive fiance. With hindsight coming back to Aus straight away probably wasn't my smartest move, I struggled to get work money was extremely tight (I have a high level of debt ) and my health took a toll, which probably ended up with me getting meningitis, though my health hasn't been great for a long time possibly due to high stress and having glandular fever when I was younger. My partner has been amazing, but he is realistically all I have over here and the toll is starting to wear him down. He suffers from PTSD and I'm not helping him. I feel like I'm pushing him away and I don't know how to stop it. He needs me to work so we can pay rent and buy food, to ease pressure on him, i totally get and hate the fact I have relied on him financially. But I am struggling with being back to work. I feel the sensible thing to do would be to move back to the UK for a while, but I worry that the distance will be the end. To make things a little trickier my sister is coming over in Feb to travel a bit, but of course I don't have money saved as being hospital and struggling for work in Nov used up savings I had. So in my mind I have no choice but to work every day to save money for her trip and to pay bills etc. to help out my partner. I realise I am so lucky that I have a job and it pays well, I forget to see how lucky I am my current situation isn't helping with feeling positive. I'm so lost and stuck in a spate of brainfog. I've been referred to psych and my dose of meds has been doubled, so I am waiting for that to kick in. I just thought that if anyone has any advice or has similar situations it could help. Thanks for reading my little cry for help. Emma

Where do i begin, ive been depressed, had behavioral issues most of my life. but recently over the past 2 days, its gotten to the point where ive had suicidal thoughts. But here's the backstory
Growing up i was physically, mentally and at two points sexually abused. My mother was abusive, schizophrenic and on drugs, dad was a alcoholic and not ended up moving to Sydney growing up.
My father was out of the picture pretty much after the divorce. He was an alcholic, gambler and suffered depression himself because of his parents dying. I didn't know at the time how he felt but seeing him as bad as he was just got to me. He passed away in august 2014. And its what triggered my depression. I stopped going out, i stopped doing things i liked, i basically went into this shell. Not talking to anyone, started drinking more. not eating, showering, not wanting to get outta bed. I think it was the big tipping point for me. Since that day it comes and goes in waves. not long after his passing, its fathers day and 2 weeks after that would have been his birthday. So august/September is really had for me emotionally.
I did something in my past that my family found out about, so now they dont talk to me which im fine with. We haven't been much of a family at all. I lost friendships due to this also.
 
I havent told anyone this at all, not even my close friend of 26 years. Lately all ive been thinking about is killing myself, no one will miss me when im gone, no one will greive for me if i went through with it. even had a suicidal thought about a hour ago at the time im writing this. I dont think talking about it will help because everyone i talk to either
1. Dosent understand
2. Dosent know what to say
3. And this is the most common, say ill be here always, you can tell me, and then f***s off. Its happened so often ive lost count
I dont usually open up like this but i need to know im not alone feeling like this right? its so f***en hard to talk and convey how im feeling but it feels like i dont have much choice left.

Hi,
First timer user here, i have a great need for good advice regarding bipolar2 partner, i hope someone can help.
I am 62 and have been in a relationship with my lady for 6
years.
She has been on antidepressants for 14 years until 11 months
ago when she tapered off them because they were not helping.
Since then it has become clearly apparent that she is
bipolar 2.
The issue is that she does not want to recognise that she
has this condition (being so happy that she is not depressed)
Therefore getting treatment is impossible.
But, being in the manic phase the whirlwind continues which
is destructive and fraught with danger.
Any talk whatsoever about the matter sets her off.
I have notified her treating psychiatrist but the laws (or
interpretation of them) in Australia prevent any real dialogue.
She has now finished the beautiful relationship and asked me to leave!
What do I do?

Hi
I got a referral from my GP today for admission to a private mental health facility. I have never been before and just the decision to go has been excruciating. Not even sure if I am sick enough to go.
i have anxiety, depression, social anxiety and panic disorder. 
I have to wait until 9am to see whether there is a bed - the wait is awful. Just wondering if anyone knows if private facilities usually have wait times?
also, what should I expect there?
thank you

Hi Everyone,
I am wanting to reach out for help, guidance and reassurance. I’m 33, married with 2 children. I know something isn’t right and I’m just not coping with life at the moment. My youngest who is 3 is really testing at the moment and I feel like i’m constantly yelling, screaming and angry all the time. I still get up, do what needs to be done, care for my family... But I feel empty inside and I can’t put my finger on why. Not a day goes by where I’m not bad tempered, impatient or irritated by something. It sucks! I want to be happy again. My husband doesn’t believe I have any mental health issues and puts it down to having kids, life in general and our youngest who is very testing at the moment. My parenting and coping with my older child who is 7 is different. I can cope, I am more patient, He listens haha. Could it be my youngest is going through this stage and I’m finding it so challenging and it will pass as he’s older? I seem to go through some down times at various times in my life and have been to counseling and then i feel “better” and think i’m fine until it hits again months down the track? All i know is i’m feeling meh with life. Wouldn’t dare take my own life, but want to cope better, stop feeling so angry, hot headed and irritable. I feel so bad for my children and husband. They deserve better.

Hi everyone,
I guess many people have difficulty at Christmas and I feel for them, this year I am finding it harder to settle myself to get through it. Even now I have uneasiness sitting in the quiet, I hear birds, cars see trees and outside there is a bit of a cool breeze. It has been a difficult year riding a roller coaster of emotions, anxiety and depression, and at the moment I think I am in heightened anxiety. This time of year has been hard since my mother passed when I was pregnant, my son is 11yrs old. The first Christmas without her my M.I.L manipulated my husband and said my Dad said something to her and I was caught in the middle trying to settle things it didn’t work, my husband took it out on me, my dad went back home a few days later and he didn’t say anything to her as, I confronted him, the day she was leaving, she said to me for what ever the discussion was, she knew how to get her way and manipulate, so in general I find it hard at Christmas, I make it nice for my son. I dread it myself. I have been through a lot since the passing of mum. My maternal family are deceased and I think I feel stuck where I am. My husband said to me earlier this year you haven’t been right since your mum died, he is right, but I had no support from him and still don’t, he has never understood anxiety and depression and never will, doesn’t believe in medication or psychologists. There is too much involvement from his mother and her involvement the last 2 years has been full on and continues. Mid way through the year I had discussions with my psychologist about leaving and when I think of this it eases me, what causes me anxiety is custody of my son. If it was me I could walk out. I do everything for my son, but in his eyes his dad is the best. My son does have special needs; level 1 autism; speech delay, cognitive processing issues and if he has a meltdown, my husband and MIL say oh he’s tired.  He gets overwhelmed, they don’t get it. I would never turn my son against his dad. As my husband has spent so much time with his mother, in July this year she went away for 6 weeks, I thought we could reconnect but he spent all his time at hers renovating stuff and being up there was our family time, but my son and I didn’t go up there much either. My son wanted to go to the Gold Coast in January after Christmas which we are. I think my anxiety is more about being away with my husband as I really have nothing to talk about anymore. Any suggestions please.

I have been battling these depressive thoughts for a few weeks now, some days I’m okay and I can get on with my day while other days these thoughts hit me like a brick. 
It’s so hard and challenging because I feel so alone in this world. I have a friend who I reach out to often but I feel bad because she has a lot going on herself and I feel like me constantly opening up to her is annoying her.. 
I’m going to have a huge operation in a few weeks and my mum hasn’t been on my side for the last three years. 

I feel so lost in such a big world and I don’t know what to do anymore. Nights I just want to run away..

I don’t know what to do and I’m scared to tell someone because I feel like they will say I’m being dramatic. I don’t know what to do or what it means and I’m so very confused. I’ve lost all interest in activities that I used to enjoy, I’ve hardly have any energy, I don’t have any disire to do anything.

I am a 46 yo man who has struggled with severe depression for the last 12 years. I was drinking heavily for 10 of those years. I would drink a case of beer and some wine and whatever I could get my hands on and afford, not working meant I had to get the cheap stuff. It took 3 goes at detox at a hospital but in the end it was worth it. After the first two times I went for a few months and something triggered me off and the heavy drinking started again. I only woke up to get drunk and went back to sleep. A never ending cycle. I have been off any alcohol for just over 2 years now. My blood pressure has returned to normal, as well as all my blood tests including liver function. I used to wake up and vomit and then have a few drinks, again and again. I now don't think about drinking at all, I have simply put into my mind that if I do, the last 2 years would have been wasted. Its not easy, but now that I don't drink my depression is a little more manageable. I would recommend taking the leap and going for a detox in hospital. Its about 5 days of having nurses looking after you followed up with medication. I wish I had done it sooner. As they say 'never give up giving up'.

Hi everyone, I’m 23 year old male and I think I’m going through depression and am seeking advice.
About 11 months ago I was taking a hair loss drug. I reacted pretty badly to the drug and it has completely messed up my hormones and endocrine system. I have been really sick for the last 11 months as a result. I am working with an endocrinologist who has managed to restore my testosterone levels, and do feel physically better now. But the ordeal has left me scarred and has had a huge impact on my life.
Before this ordeal, I was energetic and motivated, I was really into health and fitness, loved camping, snowboarding, 4wding. However, now I have lost all aspiration, am hopeless and do not find enjoyment in the things I once did. All I want to do is spend all day in bed under the covers and eat junk food - a full 180 to how I once was.
I recently moved to a different city, so have very little friends and family here. I thought I would get better once my hormones were fixed, but I still have no interest in socialising and meeting people.
I work a stressful and high demand job. I love what I do and love the people there, however waking up every morning to go to work is a struggle at the moment and I am contemplating quitting. I want to work, but the day by day is just a struggle at the moment.
I have not told anyone, not even family about what I’m going through. I don’t want my parents to worry.
How do I get my life back on track. I am considering antidepressants at this point to help get me on the road to recovery so I can rebuild my life.
Current symptoms include:
- Fatigue and tiredness
- oversleeping
- overeating and weight gain
- brainfog
- sad mood
- hopelessness
- isolating from friends and family
- low libido
really appreciate any advice anyone can give, thank you

Hi I am Shyer000 and I’m concerned that I may have depression but I’m not sure? I am only young but old enough to understand this as I am a teenager. I have taken online tests and they all resulted in high but I don’t want to see a doctor and I’m not sure how to tell my Mum that I think this is happening. A couple weeks ago I felt really alone in this world and I shouted at my brother and sister (who were laughing at me) whatever you think it’s funny that I want to kill myself! My sister told my mum the other night and she was upset because I close friend of hers had just attempted to commit suicide which didn’t help the fact that I felt so alone and unwanted. I’m not sure I want to ring anyone yet but I’m up for texting.
Can anyone give me any advice on what to do?

Hi all 32 GAD and depression suffererer here. I just need to share my feelings right now.

Every Monday morning when I wake up I have a moment of pure honesty. Where all my normal walls are stripped away, I have nothing to hide behind and feel ALL my pain. All the hopelessness. Feelings of being a failure, pathetic, a loser, ugly, not good enough. 

Now I think it's important to ""sit"" with these feelings and actually ""feel"" them in order to learn. But of course it only takes a few minutes before life takes over and the feelings get buried again. In this case I feel like my coping mechanisms that I've developed over many years to live a normal and productive life are working against me. 

In writing this I'm not looking for resources/advice to help to resolve these negative feelings (I know how to do that). I guess I'm hoping that I'm not alone in experiencing this?

Hi everyone, first time ever posting on this forum.
This feels weird to do because I don't like sharing my problems with other people, but at least it's anonymous. 
Basically, I've been feeling hopeless. All I want to do is get out of the present, and into the future, but I don't know what I'm going to do once I get out of high school. The last thing I want to do is work behind a desk all day, because I could never see myself fitting in there. Problem is, I don't know if I have enough money or talent for what I really want to do. So the future looks bleak, and the present is just as bad. I have little to no social life (despite my best efforts), no commitments to anyone or anything outside of family, and grades are pretty average. It's a horrible feeling to know that you are destined to fail, and that it won't get any better when you leave school.

Hi
so I recently got a job I quite enjoyed for about a month and then the second month felt like everything was an effort, I started getting anxiety attacks with the thought about working. These attacks would happen 2 days before I had to work. 
Yesterday  I pulled up my drive way and broke down 1 hour before I had to work my mum saw me and called my boss saying I couldn’t come in anymore. 
Since then I have been extremely depressed and felt hopeless I’ve never been able to hold down a friend or a job without fearing I would lose it or just wanting to give up so it would make my life easier. 
Can someone tell me if this is normal and what I should do, perhaps share similar experiences or guide me?

Shit went down recently for me (lost someone. No one died). I was distraught for a couple of days. Crying a lot. Absolutely shattered.

And then I started feeling emotionless even though I know I would and should be feeling emotions.
I feel dazed and trance like. Like a haze. I stare at things but I'm not zoning out or actually staring. I don't feel anything. I don't feel love, despair, hope, sadness, no empathy. Sometimes I get closer to feeling things but I just can't. I'm edging on feeling emotions.
When I do my evening walks, it's extra weird because I just walk like a zombie staring up ahead but not at anything and I just mindlessly walk. Completely emotionless.

I've had experienced this a lot before. I'm only just talking about it know because me feeling nothing right now is really weird. I just want to feel something. And I want to care. But I can't make myself feel anything or care. (btw I don't self harm, never have.)
The only thing that showed I still felt anything was my back pain and shoulder pain which is caused by things like anxiety or stress. But that's also gone.
I used to be scared I was a psychopath or something because I never felt anything at all. No empathy, no care ect.

I told a friend about this and they said that it sounded like disassociation but honestly I have no clue. But It could also be depression? Is it grief? I don't know. I just want to feel something so badly.
I also worry that it means I don't care about what happened or the person I've lost.

For some backstory, I have had diagnosed depression since I was 15, so 4 years now. I am used to the constant up and downs with my mood, and thought for the past year that I had decent control over my depression and was mostly fine. I thought that my anxiety was all I had to worry about, so I didn’t even think of the depression. 
Recently however, I am finding myself in one of the worst depressive episodes I’ve had for a long time. I need help, but I’m still dependent on my mother, and I asked her to stop my psychology appointments so that she could afford help for her own issues. I can’t afford them for myself. We do get help paying for 10 sessions under the mental health plan, but we still have to pay a decent amount, and the mental health plan no where near covers how many sessions my psych recommended for me. 
I am scared where my thoughts are taking me. I’m not sleeping well, which I know isn’t helping, but I don’t have the motivation to fix it. I was getting jealously issues over my best friend hanging out with other friends, and I know it was toxic and unfair of me, so I have pushed all my friends away. I feel like I am a burden, and that I should slowly push away from them so it’s less painful for them. This is the hardest thing for me, because I feel so alone....but watching them talk and laugh together, hang out... it made me feel even more alone. My best friend is amazing, she has tried to help me so much and I know she loves me, so I don’t know why I let this jealously affect me so much. 
I just need someone to talk to. I don’t know where to go. I wish I had my psychologist but I don’t.

Hi everyone,
This is my first time posting and I'm not sure what to expect. I guess I should tell you a bit about me before I pose some questions that I would really appreciate feedback on.
I'm 48 (male) and battle treatment-resistant depression, generalised anxiety disorder and an alcohol use problem; all since I was in my early teens. It's been a very tough road navigating treatments (anti-depressants, anxiolytics, stimulants, anti-psychotics, mood stabilisers, ECT, TMS, CBT, interpersonal therapy, medications to address my alcohol use, etc.) and the devastating effects my condition has had on relationships. My anxiety is well-controlled with a non-benzodiazepine medication at the moment, but I expect to develop tolerance to it as has been my experience in the past. I eventually found a SNRI anti-depressant 11 years ago that prevents me from living in a crippling abyss of depression, but I'm left with persistent anhedonia that I now recognise has been the long-standing reason for my inability to define a direction for my life.
With some unfortunate exceptions, I'm grateful for my privileged access to excellent medical professionals in Australia and in the US. I'm looking forward to consulting a psychiatrist who specialises in the treatment of mood disorders, anhedonia in particular, and would really like to hear about others' experience with anhedonia.
Anhedonia is the (relative) inability to experience pleasure. Although not always present, is it the worst possible symptom of treatment-resistant depression? I think that it is.
How can anhedonia be successfully treated? I was prescribed a selective dopamine receptor agonist, a good idea and supported for the treatment of anhedonia by a small number of clinical studies, but the risk of unpredictable ""sleep-attacks"" makes driving too dangerous and so I won't take it.
How do you cope with anhedonia? In the long-term, it's paralysing for me and makes me periodically suicidal.
Life without pleasure is very difficult to sustain. Is there any hope?

Hi,
I became a mum for the first time last year to a beautiful little boy who I love to pieces, but I can't help but be envious of my old life. There is so much I miss about my life before DS (darling son), and I can't help but feel resentful towards him sometimes.
I have suffered from depression and anxiety for over 10 years now, I manage with medication, but some days are just BAD. DS has been going through a really clingy/separation anxiety phase (even if you're right next to him, he wants to be held). Hubby works during the week so it's only me and DS throughout the day. The last couple of weeks has just been winging and winging mixed with teething (I hope), and last night it got the better of me and I snapped. 
I knew it was coming so I put DS in his cot where he would be safe, then I lost it. I through things, I shouted at my husband (who sadly is used to me having meltdowns) and I wanted to hit things. I try really hard not to hit things, so I push against a wall or door frame to expel the pent up energy. Hubby went to took care of DS which was great, but it also left me alone. I've always had Hubby to help hold me, or hold my hands and be there. This time I didn't. This led to resentment again towards DS for taking Hubby from me when I needed him. These thoughts then led to self-loathing and self-hate. I went for a drive. I cried for a good hour. 
I am going back to work next week for three days and I am so excited. Does this make me a bad mother for wanting to leave my child? I just don't think I am a good SAH (stay at home) mum. 
I'm hoping with me being back at work and having these breaks more often will make me a happier mum for DS.
Thanks for listening. Just needed somewhere to vent.

I was doing really well after coming down from about of mania...and then on the 10th, the music world was informed of the sad news that the legendary drummer Neil Peart from Canadian trio RUSH had died of brain cancer. This is not a post to promote RUSH so all I am going to say is this band had a very intense fanbase who were personally invested in their music and the lyrics to their songs, which Neil Peart for the majority, was responsible for writing. Suffice it to say, as a fan I was devastated and have been for the last few days.
I am sure we've all had similar experiences when a musician or entertainer who's art means a great deal to you dies, and the feeling of loss and heartbreak can be for some, just as intense as it would be had a close friend or relative passed. And while the vast majority of people I know have never heard of RUSH could see I was visibly saddened, and have approached me with compassion,  to some people, the idea of me mourning over a person who I do not know personally and have never met, puzzles them. These people seem to be insulted that I'd be so upset over the death of an entertainer. And as such, I've relegated to trying to hide my pain, or just telling people who ask me what is wrong, that a friend of mine has died, as not to run the risk of my emotions being invalidated.

I dunno how to explain this.

I feel trapped by my depression, like it is some sort of cell clouding around my head, trying to feed me with everything bad in the world, my favourite band being bad, mad men controlling the superpowers, my parents fighting with each other every day...

I feel sad. I feel angry, I feel like I want to cry and want to rage at the same time, but I feel exhausted every day. It feels like the same cycle and nothing that I think about will ever come true. I want to go places, see everywhere that I want to, be with my friends and then settle down and do a job that will help other people who are just like me, but currently I feel like nothing is going to get better.

I'm on anti depressants, I have to take sleep medication because my thoughts keep running through my head, I have to see my therapist, psych and chologist every month, but it seems this ghost never goes away...

What can I do? Am I going mad?

Hi everyone. For the past several years - i would say 2017 - till now i have been on a roller coaster of family troubles and depression. Throughout it all, i tried my best to make everyone smile but today i realized: who ever made the effort to make me smile. My social anxiety has sky rocketed, my self confidence drained and my career has hit a brick wall. I am stuck and running in circles, i tried my best to brush it away but everything hit me when i tried something new for once - in a long time -. I decided to take a day for myself and hit the M7 bicycle track. It was wonderful and i haven't felt genuine peace like that in years. But with peace came the reality of my life. 
I warned myself i would change this year and i plan to do so. Hoping to volunteer for the RFS and possibly go back to TAFE to finish off my HSC and find a good career yet, my stomach churns and i feel this terrible anxiety when i think about these things due to the amount of communication i would be required to do. I am 24 and feel hopeless and lost. I know what i want, i know many people cannot say that, and yet here i am so depressed and scared of the simplest things that i feel trapped. 
Currently don't have a job, no income, was hoping to see a therapist to help me but when you're broke it just gets worse. I feel like a loser having to finish my hsc at the age of 24, I've been talking about it for five years and I've beaten myself over the head with excuses. 
I don't know what to expect here, i just hope it brings some relief...

Hi all,
I am guessing this topic might resonate.  I've gone through a deep depression which was filled with both anxiety and depression and have come out the other side where I am in a very good place.  However, I am still coming to grips with other factors which contribute and keep me isolated from the outside world.  The problem is, while I deal with these issues, I look back at where I was compared to today, and I am happy.  The problem is, friends, family etc don't understand, nor do they when I try to explain it to them.  I totally get that they want the best for me and they EXPECT the old me to return to ""normal"" life and be the person I was before.  
The problem is that the more they push and the more they show no understanding, the harder I push back.  I know my isolation doesn't help because I tend to brood and let my anger get the best of me.  It becomes infuriating that others think they know better than I do and I tend to lash out when people refuse to take my word on why I am living like I am doing.
It is a great source of frustration for me and it gets to a point where I don't need this in my life.  It's also caused friendships to end and family members to disassociate with me because I lash out.  The really frustrating part is that while they think I am wasting my life away, I look at the progress I have made from basically not being able to get out of bed for two years and not wanting to face the day, to not being able to sleep some nights because I have something I look forward to the next day.  In other words, I have created a life in my own little world or bubble that has me happy and content to a certain degree.  It's not ideal and it looks far from ideal to outsiders.  I try to explain that it is a process for me, but all they see is that I have wasted years of my life and I am not getting the help THEY think i should get.  
No matter what I say, they never understand.  They think there is a magic wand that if I do what they want, I will return to the person I was.  And as I said, it has caused a lot of relationships to end, which is the sad part.  My problem is my anger because I take the attitude that you are either with more or against me.  I'm sick of trying to explain myself.

Hi I suffer from major Depressive and anxiety disorder and have been for the last 5 years. I have been on Newstart allowance and now they are giving me the runaround so I was told by them do apply for the dsp. 
My my question is has anybody recently applied for it and how’d you do?? I have an appointment tomorrow for a job assessment before they make a decision which I don’t understand and I’m already receiveing calls my a job employer wanting to book an appoint with them. 
Any tips ops you could give? I have given all my paper work in including letters from gp and psychiatrist. Just unsure if I have enough. 
I was read some forum posts from a couple years ago saying it was extremely hard so just want to know if anything’s changes?

Hi,
I'm new to these forums but am seeking advice. 
Yesterday I had my first day back after 8 months maternity leave.
While away my job was restructured. I am now reporting to my maternity leave replacement.
Since going in I have realised that essentially my role is down graded and I will be doing the work of the person that reported to me.
I feel severely depressed and isolated. I don't know what to do or who to turn too. My partner wants me to suck and work as it's an income and I know logically I have to work yet I have done nothing but spend the day in tears.
Seeking advice from those that have had similar feelings about work or how to manage depression at work in general.
Thank you

Hello, 
I'm just venting  on here and maybe looking for some advice
I feel like my life no longer has meaning or purpose.  I have felt like this for a while, and while I have sought help everyone has told me that this feeling is normal. I'm still living with my parents, and they have largely made decisions for me about my career path and studying, and I have gone along with them probably because I was unable to think of or suggest any alternative. I am concerned this could be due to depression or anhedonia. 
 I feel I am stuck in a cycle which I feel has had horrific results. I have spent the last two years doing multiple full time degrees at once and while I have mostly done well in these I have worked long hours every day to get all the work done. I know didn't want to do this at all but felt like I didn't have a choice because of my parents, who have come across as aggressive and controlling. I have felt scared to confide in them, and I didn't know what I wanted to pursue instead. I've also spent long periods gaming to escape from the world, and because of social isolation. I only have a few friends and they're busy with full time jobs.  I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general and get stuck because of the excuses I make because of this.  The time at my computer, mostly doing work/assignments, as well as anxiety has caused me to have neck/head injuries, and I can't even walk or turn my head properly without sore or very tight muscles and need to lie down frequently to feel comfortable. I have also recently had a traumatic experience that has made me feel more depressed the last month or so. I think I am also burned out from working so hard. 
Now whenever I think of doing anything long-term with my life, I am aware of all the work required to be successful and it puts me off, and I often don't enjoy the activity itself anymore. I think I will pursue something related to music, as I have been performer and composer and did my first degree in music, but lately haven't written or played much due to feeling depressed.  Funny thing is, I  feel guilty about being unproductive and want to get very good and important/successful at something and live a productive life, but I don't know what or how.
I have been trying to see a psychologist for a while and have gotten multiple referrals from my GP, but they have been on leave and/or haven't answered my calls. I'm hopeful I'll be able to get into see one soon.

Hey guys - sorry for the rant. I'm new to this (and it shows lol).
So, HSC results came out last month, and I took it pretty hard. I don't really remember the week after, but I don't think I talked to anyone. I was stuck in some pretty dark thoughts. When I got that number, a lot of things crashed down on me - I tied a lot of my self-worth to that result. It's like that number told me, you have no future, and when my mind took over, it snowballed into you're fat and ugly and stupid (my mind's not very articulate).
I feel so heavy. At random points of the day, it pulls me to the floor. I couldn't cry, for some reason, and I feel emotionally dead, except for this perpetual dread. I haven't responded to my friends - they all did well and I keep thinking that they have this power over me. And strangely, I've been having nightmares every night and waking up exhausted. I sleep at 6am because I torture myself over every mistake I ever made and the sheer loneliness kills me. I think, How can I ever be happy knowing that nights like these exist?
It sounds weird and I can't really explain it, but I'm worried that I'm just doing this for attention. And worse, I kind of don't want to get better. It feels like I haven't punished myself enough and I'm scared of when I'll be okay again because that means forgiveness and acceptance and I can't do that right now. I haven't gone to anyone, because I'm probably just being dramatic. Sometimes, I feel really okay. The numbness actually helps a little. Maybe I'm pitying myself and letting it go to my head.
A few days ago, my parents told me that my behaviour was childish, that I was being rude by shutting myself up in my room. I know they mean well. They don't know how to deal with me. But I think that was the first time that I had cried since the results, and I was surprised at how emotional I got. It felt like my deepest fear, that I was just being a dramatic teenager and everyone feels this way and this is life, just some bottomless pit. And I was angry too. How can I possibly justify that? I have no right to be angry! I get their point - I just had never felt so alone.
I don't know what I want to get from writing this. My head is full of fog, and I am so drained. I didn't want to consider the big D-word for fear that I was just indulging myself. Am I faking this? Is this normal? 
God, I know what I must sound like. There are people with real issues! I'll shut up now. Thank you for reading through all of this.

Realised how depressing my life is

So I’m a 17 year old guy, that has been alone for a few years now. I used to have a lot of friends a few years ago and was really popular in school but then my father got sick and I had to take care of him. This led to me doing online school which just furthered my feeling of being alone. Unfortunately my father passed away when I was 14. 

Enough about that though. So I’ve been getting by for the past 3 years now, just playing video games, watching YouTube, doing the rest of my schooling online. I was content with this and got by without problems. Suddenly, this Christmas my brother asked to hang out for the first time in awhile. I spent time with him and his girlfriend and it was a really good time. Spending time with them really made me happy. We played board games, played Pokémon go, driving around etc.. This lasted for 2 weeks since unfortunately my brother had to go back to work. When I got back home, everything sort of hit at once. I was alone, depressed, suddenly my daily routine became tedious and I just felt like crying all the time, I missed my brother and just really felt sad and alone. Everything just feels dark and my future isn’t look so bright, I don’t have any plans for the future, no aspirations, no friends, nothing. Idek why I’m writing this post, just to pass time I guess. I honestly want to change but these past few days of being alone have really made me lose hope for my future. Ahh Idk.
sorry, I’m not the best at articulating my thoughts. There’s a lot more I’d like to add but whatever.

So about four years ago I started dating a friend of mine. It lasted a couple weeks and during that we only saw each other for 2 or 3 days but we would text occasionally. Then I broke up with him because I thought I wouldn’t see him again (I was only 11 and we knew each other through a program thing) and I saw him again a month later for a bit but that’s irrelevant. At this point in time I was mentally healthy and didn’t even really know what depression or anxiety was
For about a year I didn’t think about it but as I started developing depression and anxiety and crap I started thinking about him.( I haven’t had a relationship since then and I don’t know if I could even call it one as it was so short. ) But then I started thinking about it. And it hasn’t stopped. Every single day I think about what I had and how I threw it away and how I feel guilty and every single time I leave the house the only thing on my mind is seeing him again. I would walk through shopping centres constantly alert. I tried searching on social media but nothing. I genuinely just want to see him and apologise and talk and stop whatever I’m feeling. Back in the program thing i had a couple friends and now i think about them too. Not as bad but it’s still there. I don’t know what this is or what to do but I get so many negative thoughts like what if he’s dead or what if he hates you and I don’t know how to feel and I hate it. 
Whenever I start thinking about him I get depressed and lonely and my self worth plummets and I feel guilty etc. 
Does anyone know what this is. I don’t think he should mean that much to me and I know it’s irrational but I can’t stop thinking about him.

I've posted heaps about my mistake in moving from a coastal town to and inland town, and I don't know if anyone can really help but I am so homesick and without anything to do I am lapsing into serious depression. A combination here of heat, drought and smoke have curtailed any hope of walks with my dog except late in the day just a stroll in the one park that is kept alive and green in the drought here.
Where I lived before we had a set routine - go for a short walk in one place where Sam my little dog could have a paddle, then go home and have lunch, after lunch visit the OpShop and then go to one of the outdoor cafes to get a breeze and have a read and a cool drink or sometimes meet with a friend. Usually there were other people to chat with and I knew the staff at the cafes, it was a little town.
Now in Big Inland Town I feel lost. The only dog friendly cafes are in the street near traffic and unpleasant in the hot weather. It's too hot to walk and there is no sea breeze here! I miss the sea and the beautiful places I used to live and I am beating myself up over making such a horrible mistake moving here, only realising now that what I had was a cramped tiny Housing flat but I did have lovely walks and outdoor cafes go to with my beloved dog.
Here I have lost all those things. I saw the house in the snow and wasn't really aware of just how terrible the drought was and didn't know how hot the summers had become. There are almost no shady walks here. The cafes are mostly in the shopping malls. Without aircon the house is hot, it has no verandahs it's an old 1950s fibro and the yard is hot, dry and full of burs so not the lovely yard I was hoping for my dog to enjoy.
My poor dog seems depressed and I am sleeping in until almost midday because there is nothing to do and no company. I've been to two GPs here, both women were rude and one was quite abusive, yelling at me because I called her Dr and her first name (as the reception staff told me to do) and didn't call her whatever her surname was. They've halved my antidepressant medication and anti-anxiety meds at the worst possible time.
I tell myself in Autumn we will be able to walk more but how do I keep my spirits up when I am so homesick, can't move back, and am beating myself up for making such a mistake and for making by beloved dog so miserable? Any help please, I know there is no clear solution, just some kind words would help. Thanks.

In our 8 year relationship my partner has spent the majority of the past 6 years unemployed. She is intelligent & highly educated. I am not a high income earner & have pretty much finacially supported both of us. We get by by but struggle to indulge ourselves very often. There have been times she has broken down before but showing my support & telling her I love her have always helped in the past.
A few months ago a workmate tried to set her up with a job & I dont think she went through with applying. I have never pressured her into finding work before but I really felt let down by this & perhaps I wasnt emotioanlly there for her & there was a slight disconnection between us. This meant I would work, come home & tidy up cook etc & thats when I first started feeling like this was all our relatioship was ever going to be. I have been holding out for our lives to improve but felt she might never get work again & was becoming suspicious of how hard she tried.
She has a poor relationship with her family & I seem to be her only emotinal support. A few weeks ago she came home from her mothers upset like she usually is after spending time with her & I learnt she owed $500 on a credit card. I have bailed her out in the past but atm money is really tight. I came up with a plan to resolve everything by selling some items which would help her start up a business she seemed positive about & things seemd good for a week but I was struggling worrying about finances. I began crying for no reason at work & at home
This week My partner started off very distant with me & the past few days has spent locked up in a dark room wanting to be left alone. Nothing I tried could console her. Last night I visited my sister for help for myself & advice on how to handle my partner. My partner rang me when I was gone & when I told her I was at my sisters she seemed mad. When I came back I tried speaking to her but she wanted nothing to do with me. I ended up sleeping on the couch to be woken up by her yelling at me. She had breached my privacy by reading my messages to my sister. There was nothing bad but I did mention the room stank which upset her greatly. We then spoke & I tried to tell her that I was struggling & we both needed to see a doctor but she doesnt want to go. Shows no empathy for my emotions & seems like she has given up almost daring me to break up with her. Im worried if we did break up what she would do as I am her only support & worry she could end up homeless or worse

After years of doing all known medications and so called talking therapies, nothing has helped. With all the suffering everywhere and meaningless, why even bother going on? Life seems to be one big practical joke.

Hello,
This is my first time posting on anything so im sorry if it is just me rambling, I don't really know how to type these sorts of things . For 3 years now I have been feeling just down no matter what I do, I don't know who to talk to hence why I am posting here, Among family and friends I am seen as the ""funny guy"" but I feel that now that they just wont take me seriously anymore and I don't want to burden them with my issues as they already have there hands full. I was unemployed for 2 years after I finished school and honestly there were some time where I thought maybe death was the easier option, I know that never would be the solution as it would just hurt my family and friends. After I finally got a job I thought these feelings would go but if anything they feel the same. I just have no drive to do anything and honestly im surprised that I am writing here. Thank you for reading and sorry again for the ramblings.

Hi, I returned from staying with family, and had a great time; but within hours of getting home I felt irritable, had low self esteem and I couldn’t stop a strong amount of negativity from being said. I think it’s a result of feeling sad and talentless, and talking to myself out loud is a way to prove that I’m not a pushover to other people. I don’t understand where this whole thing is coming from. Does anyone else relate, or have advice for those sad/grumpy feelings? I hope I can get to a more positive, constructive, focused and relaxed place in general life.

Hi all first post here.
after 8 years of being on a total roller coaster of behaviour which has lead to many arguments  with my wife of 13 years I have finally been give a dose of antidepressants which seem to work and make me feel normal but the last 2 months behaviour I think will be too much to overturn.
i have over the years blamed her for not making me happy despite being pretty much a perfect wife . I have said she does t show affection , is lazy at sex, does t put out enough , is nicer to other people than me , have said things about her sexual past and even worst of all shared some of them with her parents .
i have know what I was doing was wrong but I physically couldn’t stop my cycle of behaviour . I would be good for two weeks , slide for a week then bad for a week . Then ask what was my wife’s problem for her not being nice to me as I’d moved on from what I had just done
i have moved out 6 weeks ago and had a week on week off good bad behaviour which I was triggered by white lies that would totally set me off on an accusational rampage . 
the last straw was when I was t told about my kids Christmas carols at school which I unloaded on her mother in law at which point I knew I was at the end of what was acceptable and seriously considered ending it all . Only the thoughts of my 3 kids stopped me .
i spent  4 days in a psych hospital at my own request for my safety . 
i am now level for the first time in 7-8 years and feel excited about things and energetic . I feel butterflies in my stomach about my wife as I can see and appreciate her again .  It then there’s what I’ve done.
Despite me now seeing the light it thinking’s too late 
any thoughts

Hi my name is Rob and i am 59 years old. My story is that over that last 4 years or so i have lost both my parents who were a good age (87 and 91) i have also lost my son in law tragically at the age of 30, and then after a very short illness my youngest sister who was 68. Shortly after she passed away last June i remember waking up one night with a horrible sinking feeling that scared me so much that i woke my wife to tell her about it. Around a week later i had the same feeling but this time after i got home from work. Around this time i started suffering with insomnia along with this feeling happening more often. I saw my GP and started me on talk therapy for my sleep issues. Things over the next couple of months didn't improve much and i started feeling in a low mood. Went to see my GP and he suggested i take an SSRI which i dually did, and can honestly say it was the worst two weeks of my life. I was waking up extremely depressed in the morning, i was waking in the night with anxiety and panic attacks, i would have no energy at all until around 4pm, then it was almost as though someone had flicked a switch and my energy came back. Anyway after 15 doses i had a chat to my GP and decided to stop them. That was 4 weeks ago now and i feel worse than before i went on them.
I am really confused about what to do, my sleep has improved markedly over the last 6 or 7 weeks, i have also joined a gym. But i get these horrible sinking feelings mostly 2 or 3 times a day that last around 3or4 minutes, and also feel tired most of the time. Still most of these feelings dissipate towards evening time. I am unsure whether I'm depressed, suffering with anxiety because of some sort of fatigue syndrome. I am thinking about going to see another GP for a second opinion.
Sorry for the rambling story but looking maybe for a little advice as life isn't as fun as it was 6 months or so ago.

Hello,
This is the first time I'm posting a new thread.
I have been depressed for a number of years now. The anxiety that comes with it, makes it even harder. Often I burst into tears for no apparent reason and my thought patterns are often negative. I tend to be hard on myself, though knowing that it is not ""my fault"" that I feel like this.
To top it off,  I found out yesterday that the Nursing Home I work is closing. I'm in my early 50's and the prospect of having to look for work, is daunting.
I don't know what to do at the moment.

Hi all,
I have a 9 week old baby and have finally accepted that I’m suffering with post natal depression
Ive had a pretty direct conversation with my husband this morning as it’s having a hugely negative impact on him, our baby and our overall relationship
I was diagnosed this week and have a history of depression and anxiety so hasn’t really come as a shock but I’ve still had trouble accepting it
I don’t want to feel like this and fully acknowledge the illness 
I need to take first steps and have a doctors appointment tomorrow where I am going to ask to be medicated, in addition, I have a number to call to make a counselling appointment
Im desperate to fix myself and mend my strained relationship. Terrified of losing my husband 
please any tips would be much appreciated 
I know it’s not a quick fix but anything that will potentially help I am game to try

Turns out I have had an undiagnosed/misdiagnosed condition since my early teens. I am now in my mid 40's. This accumulated in a public breakdown at work about 6 month ago. What used to happen is whenever things got too much I would run away I would do this by selling everything I owned that was not essential and move to a new area/town/state and start fresh. As I worked in hospitality this was not really a problem as the industry has an extremely high turnover rate and it has allowed me to travel and live All around Australia so a positive there in my book but does not address the deeper issue.
 So 8 years ago I met the worlds most understanding and greatest woman in the world and she even agreed to marry me. We bought a little farm in a beautiful area I got out of the toxic hospitality enviroment and got a job with stability and worked to make our farm everything we could want..and it is. So why do I feel the way I do? I know I am in a better position than a lot of other people I have no debt to speak of the mortgage is paid off I should be the most happy go lucky guy on the planet.
So I have everything i could want i really do. Yet I still feel like this and it's awful So I feel guilty and ashamed feeling like this when I know there are people a lot worse of than me, which leads to self loathing because of my selfishness which runs back into guilt which makes me anxious about everything which leads to depression which leads back to guilt which leads back to self loathing.
now i have read my post back  it seems whiny and insignificant to other peoples problems and i feel guilty about posting

I don't know where to start this but I need to vent as well as ask for advice. My social life is pretty good but very spaced in meaning I have a lot of friends but I don't have a group of friends just loads of mini groups or singular friends that I hang out with a lot however I just can't ever feel fulfilled no matter how hard I try to socialize and be productive. I just feel like I'm having a mid-life crisis but at a young age? I have to think about my career path, what I'm going to do, finding more friends with my interests, going to a new school, worrying about loosing people, and just a lot on my plate. I have a lot of my own friends as well as people I don't like going to my new school next year and those people have caused me a lot of mental health issues which I worry that they will approach me however I am going to do my best to avoid them but I still have doubts. I just get so tired in social situations easily and get depressed which I fear may have a huge toll next year and I don't know what to do. There's just so much going to happen and I don't know how it will play out. The best I can hope for is a friend group who just aren't ""too"" much and just are more chill and fun like the ones I have now.

I don't feel like have any future. Everyone else is off being able to do what they want to do and live their lives, but I'm stuck in the same spot that I've always been. I don't even care about what happens for me next year.

I have battled my deppression anxiety and ptsd for years. Im 28 I have no qualifications no job and I feel like every day is a massive impossible mountain. My ptsd sends me into disassociation and dispair and my anxiety attacks and deppressive cycles are never ending. My day pretty much consists of trying to muster the courage to get out of bed and have breakfast. I also live in a supported residence which facilitates over 50 people in total though I dont think there are more than about 35 people living here currently. I am feeling the loneliness keenly this time of year as everyone is busy. My ndis worker is saying that I may have been misdiagnosed and is keen to see if bipolar might be what I am suffering as my moods fluctuate rapidly and with little to no warning!

Christmas is always tough for me, as I have no family and almost zero friends. It hurts seeing so many people having fun, joy and happiness, while I wallow in sadness.
This year is especially bad, since I've been unemployed for over a year, and was officially diagnosed with depression a few months back.

My Mrs worked all day, and I tried to stay pose and happy to see her family this evening, but once she got home I broke down. I cried, and cried, and cried.

I didn't want to feel trapped at her parents and I couldn't cope seeing people tonight. I know I should've been there to ensure she had a good time, but I felt more like a hindrance than a positive.
So I stayed home.

I feel so worthless, like such a waste of space and I have to hold everything in because it I voice my problems I just drag down others. Either they consider me to be negative, or someone who is always upset.
Keeping everything in is exhausting, and the one time I speak out... I feel like I've let everyone down.

I just don't know how to keep going like this, every day is so tough

I'm really struggling at work and feel trapped in a job that no longer offers me the stimulation and accomplishments I need for my mental health and career progression. 
I have a lot of family challenges and don't get much emotional support from home. I fell apart a bit earlier in the year as I couldn't sleep properly and even had a sleep study test done.
I've been too long in my role and I have been searching for another job. I used to love it but my team leader (not line-manager) is a very rigid micro-manager and I am unable to thrive under that kind of leadership. We don't communicate well and since I've been reporting to someone else she doesn't talk to me directly unless she has to. I can't win her trust.
I set myself very clear goals of what to accomplish this year to help me get another job where I can flourish. Unfortunately my role changed and throughout the year all my goals were unable to be met. 
As it wouldn't be clear for a while what my new responsibilities would be, I reduced my hours for several months  and concentrated on networking and job applications. I felt great when I have an 'iron in the fire' but I haven't even had an interview and I am no longer in a good head space to look for work. After too many years in the same role my skill set doesn't suit what the market wants. I have therefore looked into PG Study as my workplace has a policy supporting this. This new focus is empowering and gives me hope. However, my line-manager has just urged me to consider delaying study because she's concerned that with my mental health issues it would be another layer that I couldn't cope with and they need me to be at full capacity next year.
I'm gutted because she has been very supportive of me finding ways to get some breadth. Her attitude seemed to change after she spoke with our line manager.
I am often sad at work. My morale is low. I'm sometimes very flat and avoid people and sometimes I've expressed frustration. I put effort into my work relationships but I've just been told I need to be careful how I present myself. I'm ashamed that I have made colleagues uncomfortable by crying at work. 
I don't know what to do. I am trying to do all the right things. I have good peer support, I see a psych, I take meds, I exercise, drink less, keep good social contact, work on my marriage, support my special needs kids and make time for myself and my hobbies. I am mostly happy away from work except for some issues with communicating with my husband.

Lately I've been feeling empty and pointless, but there's no way that I could tell anyone because none of my friends would care, they'd find it annoying, and my parents would laugh.I don't even feel like I can contact my friends anymore because I'm just a burden to them, and I used to think it was my imagination, but I'm almost certain now that it's not.
I used to always ask to hang out with my best friend, but she always made excuses that she's busy or that she doesn’t feel well after acupuncture or going to the therapist, and needs a few days to cool off. Of course it makes me feel disappointed but I have been thinking about it as normal, but when I mentioned it to my mum she said it didn’t seem normal, especially since I didn’t see my best friend for a month or so when she was sick, and she wasn’t eager to see me at all. Also, there have been a few times where I’ve stayed over at this friend’s house, and her parents have offered for me to stay longer, and she’s snapped at them, telling them that I can’t stay over any longer. I don’t understand if I’m doing something wrong because sometimes she messages things like ‘so excited to see you’ and ‘i miss you’ but it doesn’t seem like she’s telling the truth.
Recently, she told me that we couldn’t hang out this holidays because she was busy, but my mum got a message from her mum inviting me over for a barbecue. Her mum was surprised that I hadn’t heard about it, because this friend was supposed to invite me a while ago.
I really don’t know what to do about this situation because she is my best friend and I would hate to lose her. I messaged a long distance friend for advice, who said that it sounded like my best friend seemed depressed, which makes me feel even worse, because I wish if she was that she would talk to me about it and that I could try to help her.
In the end, I feel like I’m only ever a burden to others and that it might just be better if I was alone instead of getting in the way all the time. But even though I've decided this, I still get super excited if I get a notification, hoping that it's my friend, and then I get this crushing disappointment that I'm all alone, and I never know what to do, I've spent the past few weeks of holidays sitting on my phone in my room and I'm starting to get so tired of life at this point. I don't know what I'm doing wrong someone pls help me

Hi There, 
Without getting to much into my private life im feeling a great feeling of loneliness in my life at the moment, Im used to getting left out but recently I feel its hit a new level as I find myself in the holidays with nothing to do. I have gone down the path of depression and am trying my best to avoid it. Ill try my best to fill you in without exposing my privacy.
I dont have any friends I can talk about this issue, especially because the issue mainly consists of friends absence. I dont have a close relationship with my parents and my grandparents cant take heavy conversations because they have high blood pressure. Im no longer seeing a psychiatrist or taking medication (ssri - but I have been off the meds for months). So coming to this website just looking for some advice and guidance on how I can deal with loneliness, I have no interests or hobbys - sorry tried to keep it light :)

So, I posted two years ago, almost to the day.

As I tend to I have continually pushed myself to achieve, succeed etc, and I have. I have entered a new industry, one I love and achieved a great deal in approximately 18 months. I'm quite proud of myself in that regard while remaining grounded in the understanding I have allot to learn still.

Despite my achievements, friendships made etc I still have an ever present depression. Over the last two years I tried 3 more psychs, sincerely dissappointed in them, most so in the last, evidently money motivated and had little desire to explore how I feel, more so wanted to push meds and be done with it.

Speaking of meds I tried another two over extended periods of time with no positive results.

I am proud of what I do, what I can do and what I've achieved. I am very aware of the traits of bipolar disorder that present in me feom time to time and manage them accordingly. I'd say I'm fairly lucky to have a good grasp of it all and be well functioning.

Deapite this apparent hold on how severely my mental health affects my life professionally. I genuinely feel like I have degraded personally. I have become more withdrawn, have begun hiding myself from others due to dysphoria (I'm a trans woman) to the extent that I avoid my wife seeing me topless or naked and attempt to cover up as much as possible outside of my house. Depression from bipolar disorder seems to have established even further as a constant unrelenting feeling, a constant depression depriving me of feeling untainted happiness

I always manage to disappoint myself which leads to negative self talk, and subsequent self sabotaging then takes place... preventing me from completing future tasks which then leaves me feeling disappointed etc... and so the vicious cycle continues. Does anybody else struggle with this? My sense of self efficacy is virtually gone and I feel like a totally useless, incompetent person. How do I break the cycle and commit to changing different things that I don’t like about myself instead of whinging about it. It’s so frustrating and depressing.

I have struggled with depression for the past 2 years now
and am still bouncing between different medications as I feel it either isn’t helping
or I get side effects which just makes everything feel worse.  I am really struggling lately because I feel
there aren’t many options left and my Psychiatrist just doesn’t seem interested,
she is always busy and her office takes me an hour to get to.  I want to see someone else closer to where I live
and who I feel comfortable talking to but I just can’t take that step to tell
her or meet a new person and have to start all over again.  It just seems like so much effort and I don’t
want to hurt her feelings.
 I have no enjoyment in my life, as soon as I get home from
work I just want to sleep.  I tried
joining a sports team to be active and meet new people but it didn’t last very
long, the tiredness eventually won and I started cancelling on training's and
games.
 I just
honestly don’t understand why I am depressed, my life is good.
My family don’t understand it either, they try to be helpful
but just end up saying the wrong thing and then I stew on that as it goes
around and around in my head twisting into something that may have started out
as “meaning well”.  
I am the person who jokes and makes a group laugh but it’s
all just a mask, and it is so draining, I can’t keep it up as long as I used to
anymore I think that’s why I don’t have friends to talk to about anything
anymore, I try to catch up with them but I always get cancelled so my “friend”
group has considerably lessened in the past year.
Everyone seems to tell me all there problems even if I don’t
know them very well, apparently I’m a caring considerate person and people feel
comfortable telling me things.  I listen
and give advice where I can and they seem to walk away happier, Its strange
because I find it so hard to talk to people about feelings and emotions, it’s
just not something I was taught to do growing up and I just get so
uncomfortable and awkward when asked about myself, I just don’t make sense when
I try to explain something.  It makes me
feel stupid like a complete idiot.
So to sum everything up I think I’m exhausted trying to keep
the smiling face up in front of everyone while being constantly disappointed by
everything happening in my life.  I don't see myself ever being happy again.

Over 2 years ago I had what I know now to be massive mental breakdown.
I was living on my own. No partner and feeling like I was totally alone.
One day while starting a new job in high pressure sales something changed in me.
I rang in sick and just to get out of my unit I starting walking along the beach.
I felt like a zombie to be honest and starting feeling like I was shutting down!
Some how I went to my local GP and couldn't stop crying. He called for an ambulance
and then I found myself in a mental ward in hospital. How did I get there
I was asking myself! I had depression and had a mental breakdown.
The support staff asked me what stopped you from ending your life?
I said my daughter's! They then said, they are you anchors. It's true they are.
I got over that period and am now successful in a new job 2 years later.
I hope I can help others here to find their anchors and prepared to one for
Others. Thankyou for letting me share my story 🙂

This is a
self-diagnosis. I work in a large corporate company and I had a fight with one
of my team mates yesterday and it has left me stressed and asking myself
whether any decisions I make are right or not; I had been invited to a get
together for tonight and tomorrow night but I have cancelled as I don’t want to
go after the fight with my team mate. 
Maybe it’s
me feeling sorry for myself, my intuition tells me to run away from bad things
and I sit at home and I normally sleep for most of the weekend and I hate
separating myself from the world when things go wrong. If I keep cancelling
from fun things that I have been invited to then friends are going to stop
inviting me to anything.
Maybe I am
feeling sorry for myself and separating from everything is my way to ask for
other people to care, similar to throwing my toys out of the pram.
I have a
good feeling of self-worth; I am not going to be throwing my any heavy
machinery :)

hey guys, new here. I was diagnosed with depression since I was 14. I’ve been to many councillors found one that I liked, and also was anti-depressants at one stage. I don’t want to go back on them as I had a relapse and turned me for the worst. I’ve learnt to manage without them from then.. having ups and downs. At 23 I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for years I was denial about it but now I’m starting to take care of myself. 
As of current, I’ve just started a new job after working at my old job for a year it has messed me up. The manager was a narcissist would threaten I would have no job, nothing I ever did was good enough, I wasn’t the only employee in this field that got it, but I feel like she broke me. It made my depression the worst it has ever been. Now I have a new job you would think I would be much happier. I’m currently going back to uni to study nursing so working temporarily at a retail shop. I’m just so lost, I’m 29, single still living at home although I should be blessed as there’s so much opportunity to work on myself and be better. I feel defeated and I’ll never get back on top or I’ll never make it. I feel excited for nothing, just numb :(

Hi there,


I am 20 years old and have spent most of this year battling with myself about whether I am depressed or just lazy. I severely lack motivation and on most days I don’t do anything productive or I procrastinate things until it’s almost too late. Fortunately I was able to see a psychologist until August and my GP prescribed me antidepressant medication which I have been taking for about 5 weeks now. My GP expects it be having some kind of effect by now, however I’m only noticing side effects which include a very low libido and fatigue. I’m also feeling as though it’s levelling out my emotions to a point where I don’t really feel anything, or at best a little spike that disappears soon after. Lately I have felt incredibly tired and sometimes take a nap only a couple hours after I get up. I get about 7-9 hours of sleep a night and yet I don’t feel refreshed and often awaken feeling anxious.


Very recently my bedroom was renovated and I’ve spent the last couple of weeks cleaning furniture and moving things back in. For a few days I felt great and was very motivated to do things, however now I’m really struggling to find that motivation again. This is where I can’t figure out if I’m just lazy and desperately trying to use depression as a justification or if I’m actually depressed. I’m aware I’m on antidepressants for a reason yet I have never been told “you are diagnosed with depression”, which makes me question myself. I feel like I’m wasting my youth away but I can’t seem to pull myself out of this routine. To be perfectly honest, I am most comfortable when I am doing nothing, and that makes me feel free yet very guilty at the same time. Part of me doesn’t even want to change my lifestyle. I am so torn. I don’t have access to a psychologist until February so any kind of advice would be very much appreciated!


Thank you for taking the time to read. :)

Hi everyone - I'm just looking for some advice here.

I just feel so numb and empty all the time. It's not even sadness, just this crushing nothingness. It feels like there's nothing left inside but a heavy fatigue that's settled into my bones.

I don't find happiness in the things that used to make me happy - not even music (my favourite thing) makes me feel the same way it used to. I just feel empty.

Next year is my final year of school and all my friends are excited to graduate but I'm dreading it because it means having to go to university and get a job and work just to make enough money to survive. It feels so hopeless and overwhelming. I feel sick thinking about it.

I don't even feel like eating. Eating feels like a chore to me - nothing tastes good or sounds appealing. I eat because I have to.

Sorry for this rant - I just wanted to get it off my chest and ask if anyone had any advice. Thanks :)

I can't find a balance to cope with everyday things at home. I finished a degree last year and have my first full-time job since having kids. I have 3 teenagers and all my energy goes to my job. I feel hopeless at home, I'm letting down my husband and kids as all I feel like doing is sleeping when I get home. Just feeling very overwhelmed by everyday tasks. I have had many challenges in the past 18 months where I dont think I have delt with them all yet. I feel like there is no time for my kids, me and my husband. Feeling hopeless and overwhelmed and cant seem to get myself out of this mindset.

Four months ago I made a huge mistake, everything I’d ever stood for morally I threw away. I have been forgiven by those that matter most for what I’ve done but I can’t seem to forgive myself. I can be ok for days and then the nightmare of what I’ve done comes back. My psych says I have to forgive myself, I’m human and we make mistakes. I just can’t get over the guilt of what I did. I get so angry at myself for letting things get out of hand that led to my mistake. How can others forgive me but I can’t . It’s doing my head in.

When I was fourteen I started believing bizarre delusions that were implausible, such as that I was being watched by the world, and that objects could communicate with me. I also had very excited, energised feelings. I managed to stop those delusions somehow when I was fifteen, but I’m just wondering if it sounds like something to be concerned about now, even if I haven’t been affected by delusions in a long time.

Hi guys,

I've taken a few good hits in life and always managed to bounce back, resilience has always been one of my stronger points. Although at the moment, and in the last few months, I've been suffering in silence. My partner of 10 years has cottoned on that something isn't quite right, and pushing me to seek help. Not something I've ever done in my life, I've always sorted things out on my own. I've always felt (as messed up as this is) that it's weak, inferior, and pathetic, and I just can't shake the stigma. Worst of it is that I'm the first to make sure that my friends are doing ok and should seek advice, but I can't even get myself together to do it myself.

My concern is that this has become a flaw, a weak spot in my character, which will prevent any further career progression in my profession. I know this is wrong. But the voice in my head telling me that I'll never make it to management, never be considered for a senior position, tearing down all of my ambitions all day relentlessly just never seems to end. I'm remunerated generously, I live in a nice house, in a nice suburb, in my mid 20s with the love of my life. I just want more, I don't know why, but I feel like every day I'm in a losing battle with my own negative thoughts.


What are some rock solid, tried and tested techniques? What do people do other just talking about it? Do I need to start a though diary or something? 

I've just started with the headspace app, wasn't overly impressed that they want to squeeze money out of people already at a low point, but thats the world I guess. I wake up at the same time every day (5:50am), and manage my sleep apnea to the best of my ability. I eat reasonably healthy, and have started working out regularly again after a 6 month hiatus. I feel like things should be better by now. But still I just shut off emotionally, run in auto pilot, and just watch everything pass me by.

I'm done with this selfish wallowing in self pity and for lack of a better word, need to get my sh*t together, for those who care about it.

I'm sorry if anything of this is vague, or poorly explained, I'm at a loss and wanted to seek some form of guidance before I either relapse or actually speak about it.

Regards,

A

hey,
i'm a 15 year old girl and i just feel like i've missed out on so much. i know what i'm about to say sounds very dumb and its such a first world problem and i feel bad saying it cuz there are starving children in africa and my problems are so insignificant and petty :( but i guess i'll just say it because i want to get it off my chest.
as a kid i didn't grow up watching disney or nickelodeon. i do remember watching barney but that's it. now its nearly the end of the decade and people are all talking about old disney shows and reminiscing in their childhoods. and since i never watched those shows as a kid it just makes me feel like i missed out on a lot. before you say anything, yes, i know i can just watch the shows now. BUT, IT'S DIFFERENT. watching shows as a kid and looking back at it when i grow up feels very very different compared to watching a kids show in my teens just so i can talk to people about it. 
i just feel like i missed out on a lot as a kid and now the decade is ending my childhood is also ending and that makes me extremely depressed. we only get one childhood. ONE ONLY, AND I MESSED UP ON MINE. MY CHILDHOOD SUCKED :( and that's fine i suppose i can make up for it by having a great teenage life. but no. i only have one friend that i'm comfortable hanging out with and she lives in england while i live in australia. i don't have a group of friends to mess around and have fun with. i just feel like i'm missing out on the ""teenage experience"". we only get one life and i'm ruining it, messing it up. i want to relive and improve parts of my life, but sadly, i cannot. 
missing out just makes me so anxious and depressed and i don't know what to do
please help

It’s been a year since I was on here.... so much has happened to me since. As my name suggests, I was pregnant. I later miscarried at the end of January, which was a horrible traumatic event. I was 4.5 months pregnant. I then began having all sorts of strange neurological symptoms (thought to be brought on by the rapid change in hormone levels) 
These “attacks” were debilitating, and terrifying. Pupils dialating unequally, tremors, shortness of breath, chest tightness, heart palpitations, feelings of imminent death,  migraines, icepick headaches,  weak legs and more recently, uncontrollable finger movements. Sometimes they last 5-7 days. 
no doctor can tell me what is happening to me. They are just waiting for something worse to happen that would make a diagnosis more clear. And yet, here I am, in tears almost everyday, completely fearful, and on edge waiting to see what happens next. My son is 3, and I’m scared he might end up growing up without me. I’ve never been so unwell and I feel like even the doctors think I’ve lost the plot. I’m trying to be strong for my family, but I’m so scared I can’t keep it together. Can anyone tell me how to keep your spirits up when you feel you are crashing apart? I feel so hopeless. Not suicidal! Just defeated, and sick.

Depression settles low
Like a damp winter fog
Enveloping me
It's cold tendrils reaching out
Wrapping me in their grip
Squeezing
Until I am fighting for every breath
My lungs burn they struggle to expand
The shallow rise and fall of my chest
Disguising the panic
That bubbles up
Threatening to explode

My hands 
Clench
Tighter and tighter
As I search for a distraction 
From the inner turmoil
And pain
Until another wave
Overwhelms me
Forcing a moan from my lips

I close my eyes
And contemplate the abyss in front of me
The deep black nothingness
Beckons
And taunts
Offering an escape
From the crushing loneliness
That is
Depression

Outwardly my life looks amazing  and I feel guilty even writing this . I have so much to be grateful for but I feel so alone , so desperately lonely . I have adult children grandchildren and a husband . In my family I am the one who listens to others and no one would guess that I’m in deep trouble myself . My husband is distant and aloof but others tell me he’s always been likes that so I have to accept it . I married him because he felt safe and like what I needed after a violent relationship so yes I guess it’s true . I simply don’t inspire any passion in him , none and I mean in any way .  
Everyone in my life sees him as perfect because he provides for me and came  into my life when I was a single mI’m. Even my kids favour him over me and when I left they took his side . Effectively I almost lost my
family over it so I went back . Now I’ve lost any tiny bit of self respect. I have horrible health ( chronic pain) making holding down a job very hard , I cry all the time and the worse part is I’ve been seeing a counsellor for almost two years in secret ( because I’m terrified of letting anyone know how much I’m falling apart ) and I can’t even bring myself to tell her that I am so incredibly depressed that I lay awake in the middle of the night thinking how much I hate myself what a bad person I am and how no one cares about me not really . I can’t even think of a way out and if I could I’m sure I wouldn’t find the inner strength to take it . I used to be strong or think I was but not now . Even the pain I’m in I can’t share on any kind of level that people take serious because people are dismissive
of me. 
I’ve looked back at my life and realised that as a child my parents didn’t like me , my two biggest relationships before marriage were very abusive and my husband now although he says he loves me is lukewarm . Basically people don’t like me . Men have only really liked me to use me for sex and women in 
general have never liked me . My own mother only started to act like she liked me in the last few years . I used to think it was a case of like yourself them others will follow but I really don’t think so . It must surely be the case that some people are born less lovable or likeable than others. 
. There’s a lot more . Things  I feel bad about but I’ve written a novel already  . Why can’t I tell anyone all this horrible stuff about me . What is wrong with me ? Thankyou to anyone who has taken the time to read my rant

I am currently having a major depressive episode.  I don’t remember ever feeling this bad.  This time there are so many things wrong in my life, I can’t see things getting better.  
I have been off work with an injury for the past 3 months and the only time I go out of the house is to appointments needed for my injury.  My children have been taking me because I can’t drive at the moment.  I don’t want to be around anybody, I cry all the time, I have no energy, I sleep up to 15 hours a day, feel no joy in anything and there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
When I do go back to work, it’s a job I hate and dread going to work and struggle to physically do the job now. Can’t afford to train to do anything else and I am already 50.   It’s almost impossible to get new work at my age, especially being in low entry level employment.  
About 18 months ago I found out that my 18yo daughter had been molested by my nephew from the age of 11.  I blame myself. My daughter now has ptsd and all that goes along with that.  I don’t know how to help her.  My sister, who was my best friend, doesn’t speak to me anymore, because she blames my family for what happened at the hands of her son.  My children and I are mostly ignored by the rest of the family as they would rather pretend that nothing happened.  I also work for that sister, the situation is miserable. Last Christmas my children and I only had each other, while the rest of the family, all 28 of them, all had a wonderful Christmas Day together.  I am dreading Christmas.
I have been separated from my husband for almost 10 years, and I gave him my house in the settlement.  Now we are in unstable accommodation.  It’s constant stress.  My ex’s girlfriend now lives in my old house and my children are no longer welcome there because she doesn’t want them there.
All of my teeth are loose because of all my medication, and I don’t have the money to be able to do anything about it.  I won’t cope at all with losing my teeth.  It’s another thing I can’t fix. 
Reading through this sounds like I’m being a selfish sook.  But I feel the whole situation is hopeless and can’t be fixed.  Although I would never do anything to myself because of my children, I wake up everyday and wish I didn’t.  I just don’t want to be here and deal with this crap every single day.  I don’t know what to do.  Please help.

Sorry if this is hard to understand...
I’m 22 weeks pregnant and recently some problems have been coming up involving my relationship, work and the future. I’ve just gone into my 20s and my partner and I have a 12 year age gap. He works 5 to 6 days a week whereas I’m only a casual and work very short shifts about 2 to 4 times a week. He is getting very stressed about being broke especially when baby comes. We have only been together just over a year and I had doubts coming into this relationship because I knew we were at very different stages in our lives. Although he was still living with his parents he had it set that he wanted to get married, have a family and buy his own house. I was 19 when we met and not doing very well in life, not having finished school and I had unaddressed issues with depression and was also developing anxiety. These were the reasons for my doubts, I worried I couldn’t pull myself out of it and build the lifestyle and career that I would need to help him get where he wanted to be in life. We’ve come along way since then and are renting our own house as well as having a baby on the way. Anyway, I’ve been going in and out of depression since being pregnant. I really want to have this baby, I had an early miscarriage a few months before becoming pregnant again, so I’m very happy about this pregnancy however I’m struggling to find motivation in all other aspects of my life. I’m finding it increasingly hard to enjoy work as I didn’t particularly like my job before. This is making me want to avoid it even more Because of the way it makes me feel. This is now causing problems in my relationship and I feel like I’m making my partner unhappy especially since he has problems with depression as well. We come from very different families and upbringings, I have a family history of alcoholics, addicts and mental health problems. I’m worried that my partner thinks I will end up the same, I don’t feel like I’m good enough to fit into his life and family. He says he loves me but I’m worried that will change if I can’t be happier and find some motivation. I’m worried that I’ll never be able to be the person he wanted. I don’t understand why is so hard for me to just get up and do the things I need to and why the more I think about it the more I just want to curl up and not talk to anyone. I want to be the kind of person who is happy and motivated to work hard. I don’t want this to ruin my relationship. I need some advice, I don’t know what to do.

I’ve been developing increased symptoms of depression as the year has gone on.. parallel to increased stress: children’s ill health (carers role), financial stress, ongoing single parenting. My own depression is at a point that I’ve had to lessen work to manage, unfortunately making financial stress worse. 
It feels like things are beginning to spiral.
I’ve not been in a relationship since my divorce 5 yrs ago as I’ve now got big trust issues and I’m also really protective about the home I’ve created for myself and my kids.
although at the same time, I’m so lonely.
And I’m worried we’ll have to move yet again, this time due to cost of rental. I just can’t seem to get out of this rut. Ive been trying everything I know; sticking to antidepressants, mindful apps, healthy eating.. nothing seems to help this time.
sorry for the rant, I really don’t enjoy winging, I’m just at odds to know what to do.

I don't know what is wrong with me. I start to cry randomly and often I can't even comprehend why I am crying. From the outside, my life seems near perfect but I am not happy. I haven't been happy for quite some time. Its not constant. I can go about my daily life, but I am not happy inside. If you asked why I was crying at any given moment, I probably wouldn't be able to tell you. I want to stop feeling like this.

I’m not sure what the feeling is but I’ve felt strange for over 7 years. I go through waves of feeling great to being extremely down to the point that arguments take over my emotion and make me feel so low to the point life is not worth feeling these emotions anymore. Because it comes in such waves and isn’t consistent, I’ve struggled to seek help with this because quickly I can feel fine and I think it must be a ‘blip’. Does anyone else experience this?

Ive been anxious for many year and as of recent have fallen into a deep depression. I physically can not move some days, I feel so sick to my stomach, tired, extremely unmotivated and see no point in anything. 
My thoughts have gotten more negative and I’m always thinking ‘what if?’ and it is honestly debilitating. I don’t see the point in anything, I have no motivation and I’m SO SCARED. 
The depression began when my partner went away with his friends to Bali. He was away for nine days and has been back for almost a month, but I still have not been able to shake this depression. I’m so angry at myself. 

I’ve seen a psychologist 4 times and have been prescribed an antidepressant which I have just started today. Any tips or can anyone share their experience? 

it feels like a death sentence and I truly feel like I’m in the process of dying? I feel so scared and want to feel my old self again.

My Son who is in his early thirties has fallen into very deep depression. Nearly 3 months ago he was having delusions. And was exhibiting some psychotic behaviour. For someone who has worked hard since he moved to the city. He has never shown any signs of anything like this. After being admitted to a hospital he was given high does of medications. His doctor didn't give him a chance to describe what happened properly. I believe five minutes or so. He has anew psychiatrist now and another hospital admission. And changes to medications. He has now been diagnosed with Bipolar, which has really shocked and upset him. Before his first hospital admission he wasn't as depressed. Now it's overwhelming him and he says he can't try anymore. He has now will he says. There maybe a new type of medication prescribed.his psychiatrist is on holidays. So here is back living with us his parents on a rural property away from friends. He's feeling like he's in prison and everything is hopeless. He left he's job and sold his home just prior to the psychotic episodes. I'm not sure if the reality of this triggered the Bipolar. Or that he had used some recreation drug during that time. Again something he had never done. He says he has no future and regrets leaving his job. He has also had a relationship breakup three years ago. At that time he suffered depression. He worked so hard to get back on his feet. He also suffered depression 7 years ago after another relationship breakup. I am making sure he is eating and sometimes I can get him to walk. He can't read a book or listen to music as he said it makes him feel sick. He can't understand why all his friends are happy and have everything going well for them. He wonders why he's been punished. He does have feelings that his father abandoned him emotionally when he was growing up. His father argued a lot with me his Mum. He says he feels abandoned as he should have realised what his yelling was doing to him as a child. He also feels abandoned by the women in the relationships he had. I give him all my support and love. His father does too. But is oblivious to the harm he may have caused to our Son. I try to encourage him and tell him everything will be ok. After nearly 3 months he has lost hope. There have been many medication changes. Nothing is helping with his depression yet. Can anyone tell me how to help him

Hi all,
I have pretty bad depression. My only outlet is writing poems. Don’t know if it helps but I do like being creative and putting my thoughts down. Thought I’d share some of my stuff. Not very good but hope you understand it.
 
Trees of Self Image

A tranquil roseate forest full of life
Echoing with both sound and silence
You’d think a peaceful place to be
Amongst all its magnetic beauty

There is much we don’t quite know
The constant struggle to survive
The never ending chain of command
The eternal and biter cycle of life

Winged creatures fighting for their nest
The four legged will die for their next meal
Undergrowth begging For attention
And of course the dignified trees

Thick roots always searching the Earth
Heavy limbs writhing and weaving
Contorted boughs searching for the light
Competing for a chance at supremacy

In the silence they shed bark like tears
Through the sounds they hide their fears
A fate that can never be escaped
They can never exist beyond just being

I wonder what Judas was thinking in the forest that day....

C.K.

I've had self-diagnosed, low-level depression (dysthymia I guess) for as long as I can remember. I've never sought any treatment before as I've been able to manage mostly okay. I've had my share of potholes in the past but always come back out of it again soon enough.

Recently a family member brought up a long-unrequited love which was tangled up in the mess of my brother's suicide and I've been struggling. For a few weeks now I've been barely managing to hold back tears at work and crying to all the usual songs once I get home most days.

I've been wondering if maybe a short course of anti-depressants might be able to get me out of this hole and back to my normal manageable level. Does anyone with expert knowledge/similar experience think anti-depressants could help me?

Hi,
I am back in a bit of a funk after having about three months symptom free (that is a loooong time for me!). Even though I’ve had depression for the best part of 15 years I still find every funk difficult and fear that it won’t go away this time. I just find it hard to accept that I have this disease as I have a lot of things going for me and I generally don’t have any major troubles in my life - just a brain that doesn’t want to function normally. I don’t really know what I am getting at with this post but just felt the need to blurt it out

Hi all, 
This is my second time in 5 years posting here and I guess I'm posting again for a number reasons, self therapy, feedback and well, just to get it out of me. Not sure if this is relevant but I always seem to answer these questions when filling out forms - I'm a 43 yr old single gay male that lives on my own with my awesome dog, work a corporate job, have family and friends and try to maintain a social life while trying not to let the depression and anxiety get in the way.  
In 2015, I experienced my first panic attack which led to an acute bout of anxiety and depression. A restructure at work during this time while building a house on my own brought all the ugliness of depression and its twisted sidekick anxiety to the surface and as a result, I took a month off while I sought help. I went on antidepressants for about 12 months but didn't like them as they made me feel sort of numb. I was 'ok' for a while but recently hit a roadblock in September this year and had to take a month off work again. Work has been extremely stressful which no doubt has contributed (among other things) to triggering this latest episode. I asked my GP for a psychiatric assessment so that I could better understand my condition and ultimately myself and was diagnosed with Dysthymia. I'm currently seeing a Psychologist but not sure it's helping yet, however this Friday will be my third session so I suppose it's still early days. Lately when at home on my own I've been bursting into tears with underlying feelings of loneliness, helplessness and a complete lack of motivation and enthusiasm for life. If I had to choose the strongest feeling, I would say it is loneliness even though I have great family and friends around me. I feel very disconnected from life even though I have been making efforts to see family and friends just so that I have something to focus on as opposed to this heavy and lonely sinking feeling. I'm becoming extremely self analytical and question whether people actually enjoy my company anymore. I do not show anyone this side of me although they do know that I have anxiety and depression. I'd prefer not to rely on medication as I don't want a bandaid solution. I just want to overcome this once and for all and move on with my life so that I can just live and feel free to focus on the important things. 
Warren.

I feel like sometimes it is hard to accurately describe symptoms/right verbiage to physicians and family/friends.  I want this to be a thread where people can post their symptoms, and hopefully people can learn from each other but also feel understood when hard to explain symptoms match up with another.  
For me, I feel it is hard to describe how I feel depression affects memory/how time feels.  When it is 3 or 4 in the afternoon and I think back about the morning, it feels years away.  Memory feels just numb and distant so it feels like its a long time ago.  Has anyone else experienced this?

If I were to ever run away, and Chuck my Sim card away would the police be able to track me?

Hi folks 
I've never been able to be 100% honest about my feelings. I was very shy as a child and always too afraid to expose myself. This habit has continued right through to adulthood. I'm extremely introverted and emotionally 'deep' internally, yet externally I put up a facade to 'protect' myself. Because of this facade, I have always found it difficult to build genuine lasting friendships and relationships, yet that is what I crave so much! I am a father of a beautiful son whom I love so much, and our relationship is perfect because my insecurities don't exist with him. I am still physically with his mother however emotionally we are totally disconnected and I feel lonely because of my inability to open up to her. Weve had problems but I accept how my insecurities have contributed here. I work autonomously and have no friends, which in turn contributes to loneliness. 
By worrying about what others think of me, I am neglecting my true feelings, and now those truths seem to be suffocating me. I've pushed so much down for so long, it feels like I can't keep a lid on it any more. Because I can't trust people with my truths, I feel like there's no escape. Can anyone relate? Please help.

I'm 20 years old and hate everything in my life I have no friends, no relationships at all I'm alone what is wrong with me. I mean I know people that I work (also absolutely loathe being at my job) with but they want nothing to do with me it's just a work relationship and believe me I've tried to make friends there but it ain't happening. I don't care about anything and if I do try to care I quickly figure out that I don't and give up because everything just seems so meaningless and such a waste of time. When tell family or someone that I know no one all they say is find a hobby or join a club or meetup groups or something but the truth is that just doesn't work for it's impossible I can't have anything and I don't think i ever will.

Sorry if doesn't make sense I'm just trying to get it out there.

Hi everyone, 
For the past couple of months I have been suffering with severe anxiety and depression. I’m constantly thinking the world would be better off without me. I’ve seen doctors, mental health nurse and starting to see a new psychologist next week. (Also been prescribed antidepressants) 
I just feel like I’m constantly going to wake up unhappy and i absolutely hate it :( I’m always affected in the mornings and sometimes I can’t even be bothered to get out of bed, eat or speak to anyone and I think that’s worse because I’m by myself with my own thoughts. My family is so helpful and it breaks my heart cause I can see how much it breaks my mums heart when this happens :( 
I just want to feel okay again

Hi All,
Lately I've really been struggling with my motivation at work and at home. I've just been feeling so low, I feel like there's no point in trying to feel better because I always end up back where I am. I also feel like no matter how hard I try, I'm never actually improving my mental health. I compare myself to where I was a couple of years ago and find that while some things are better, there a new things that are worse. It's like a constant battle, and I guess my motivation has just dropped off from failure after failure (or what I perceive as failures). 
The worst part is I know that I'm not technically failing, I know I'm doing the best I can do at this moment in time. But I don't believe it, which is kind of weird. How can I think one thing but believe another? Which one is right? Normally the gut feeling is right, but I can't tell which one is the gut feeling and which one is the head talking. 
It's really affecting my work and my life in general. My work productivity is in the drain, and my workplace is aware of my mental health but it just makes me feel worse because I imagine my boss sitting there thinking ""here we go again, she's in a ditch. Lets see how long it takes her to pull herself out this time."" and I hate that. I hate people watching me struggle. I hate that I wake up less motivated each day to go to work, and start rocking up to work later rather than earlier. 
And my relationships are suffering. My partner is pushed to his limit, my friends are getting annoyed at me because I never want to go out or catch up, and I just disappear randomly or cancel plans last minute. It's just a real struggle, and I know I should go and see my psych again but it costs so much money. I should exercise more and eat healthier, meditate, make plans, go out, force myself to be social, but it doesn't seem to make a difference :(

I'm currently 10 weeks pregnant and I hate it. Mentally, i'm not the same anymore and I find myself becoming more and more withdrawn from activities and family. I sleep most days when not at work, and no, it's not just pregnancy exhaustion. I have no appetite for food and nothing I do eat is ever satisfying. My partner lives interstate - though hes moving in 3 weeks - and I find myself becoming more withdrawn from him as well. The pressure of the whole situation is really getting to me and I am so tired of all conversation revolving around me being pregnant. I feel weighted down by it all, and I don't mean that I don't want my baby, but I hate being pregnant and how it's changing how I feel.

I sit here, feeling like life isn't worth living and why is that ? I should be happy, right ?

I have an amazing family that supports and loves me, yes there are issues but that's normal, no family is perfect

I have friends that message me and hang out with me, that check up on me and that love me

I am now renting my own apartment 

I am successfully studying

I have a new job I enjoy

And the list goes on
It sounds perfect right? 

Yet I'm still here, struggling to see the purpose, I'm here with a lump in my chest and pain that doesn't go away. Im not sad, im not happy, im not anything except numb, i simply dont care. I feel trapped inside a vicious cycle, it makes you physically tense and mentally cloudy

Now tell me
Am i a crazy chick that is severely messed up and selfish

Or am i a person, a person who has the reasons to be happy, a person who wants to be happy, who wants to feel free, yet has this cage holding me in and even when i escape for those few moments here and there, i still find myself back inside. Trapped.

Depression is NOT a choice, it is not something I want. Why would I want to feel sick all the time, in pain all the time, unable to think clearly and unable to love completely. Depression is not me, its an illness that takes hold and it's one hell of a battle every minute of every day. From the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep, and thats if i sleep because usually it keeps me up at night, making me so exhausted that daily activities seem impossible 

Those who suffer aren't suffering by choice
You don't choose to catch a cold, you don't choose to develop cancer, you don't choose to get a headache and you don't choose to suffer from depression 

I constantly battle this.. this thing. And I usually wind up blaming myself and making myself feel bad for it. But it isn't me, I'm separate from my illness and sometimes i lose sight of the difference
Just know there is a difference.
Few people in my life have seen it in its true, worst form. They have seen the side of me that becomes so trapped i collapse in a ball, begging for it to be over, begging for the pain to stop, and sometimes it takes weeks for this to even begin to fade, those weeks where im bed ridden, unable to move and unable to even think 

This is depression in a simplified form, but everyones different, everyone suffers differently. 

You are never alone
Keep fighting ❤

Hi there,

I have just started here as I have been reading forums for about a week now. 
I am very lost at present and very stressed having been helping my (now ex) partner with severe depression/anxiety whilst recovering from PTSD. They have reached a crisis point in their own depression that successfully had them push myself and my child away due to them no longer feeling anything at all. After so many years of support and hope that they would be getting better with the help of medication as well as a person that has indeed got the understanding and compassion of knowledge of what they are going through as well as with four years of them going to a psychologist I am at a complete shock loss from the cold-hearted nature of this.

It was like viewing a death and the grief is also incredibly similar. I feel as if I have failed this person miserably just as much as they have failed myself and my child from the fact they were so cut-throat on their discard and pushing away so would really like some guidance of whether this is normal behaviour in relationships or whether it has been a point that this person indeed can no longer feel a thing.

My child is suffering dramatically from this as they do not understand why a person no longer wants to see them, be around them and was scared that they were not going to answer phonecalls or messages when they wanted to reach out to them to tell them that friends support each other.

It's a long hard story to unpack and in truth I have no idea what I am trying to ask about. Validation is my guess, of the fact that I truly could not reach this person no matter how much love and support I gave them and it got to a stage that they gave up on themselves and me.

The why is really making it hard for me to get to as I have never ever done anything to hurt another,  especially a young person so am finding it very difficult to see how they felt in a logical/illogical mess that is depression and anxiety.
Should I still try to help this person or just walk away so that I can heal myself and my child as the pressure of this is all too much now.

Thankyou if you can give perspective that I am not alone in this.
A Warriors Heart will always fight and never give up.

Hi everyone,  I am 52 years old and have a diagnosis of bipolar 2 and left temporal lobe epilepsy.  I have always thought there was a link between the two but haven't found any reasearch about it. I visited a new neurologist today and she has quite good credentials. I am happy to say the best part of the visit is that she stated that she believes there is a corelation between the two . I was very excited to hear this. I just thought i would mention it in case anyone else out there is the same as me and felt the same way but had never had any one substantiate their ideas. I would love to hear from any one else with bp1 or 2 and Left TLE.  Cheers, have a good night  every one . Xxx

I've had all this going on for years, trying to find medication and dosage and i am over it. My partner has been incredibly supportive but i am starting to think she is at her wits ends. I am tired of putting on a happy face for work ....it is so hard. I cant sleep without pills at the moment as i am  having issues of itchiness all over my body stopping me from settling. At work i am just hiding away in a storeroom and randomly crying. Worst thing is, i have always been joker, the one always laughing and joking. Keep up this facade is hard. I am a school teacher and even had to leave my classroom this week for a cry.  My anxiety revolves around my wife and her not being here and i have a complete breakdown if anything affects the routine or if i am out of contact for extend times...that impacts her as well.
I am at my wits end and dont know where to go anymore.

Hi guys
I got back onto this forum after a long absence- partly because of abuse that I received during some of my last threads.
My background with depression (or rather anxiety/depression) stemmed from a nearly unrivalled series of setbacks throughout my entire life of 38 years across two Australian states and involving both the Italian community of Australia (like my father) and the Angloceltic Australians (like my mother). To put it very mildly, I can say that despite enormous contributions made by the Italians in Australia and the increased acceptance and respect of both parties towards each other, there have been (more than) enough people from both sides who made my mixed blood look like a hideous mutative disease! Just ask the oldest fashioned Italians and all the followers of, say, Pauline Hanson!
Because of that, I was lonely, isolated, confused and felt scrambled every day on how to rise above all of the beliefs made against me. This lack of genuine respect from both sides may have been one of the biggest factors in me being prevented from becoming a ""millionaire dad"" by age 38. At my age, I am earning less money than high school dropouts in mines (despite having three uni degrees). I was likely nutritionally deficient as a child because my Australian mother could not understand how to properly cook Italian food (we had to shut up and accept it because ""she's your mother"") and it made me hate eating vegetables to this very day with brutal passion, despite their healthiness. I was seen as the only single guy in traditional Italian weddings at age 25 or so, when the eldest single girl was just 14! I was overlooked when trying to get into medical school over EIGHT YEARS just because I was seen by medical elitists as a ""lower class wog"". Even my maternal grandmother and uncle dislike my father and try to use him up for financial gain and to stay on my mother's ""good side"".
And, it gets better, have you seen all the videos of Italian stereotypes made by SuperWog and Sushi Mango? I have not really seen any stereotypes against British/Irish Aussies or Aboriginals by them, have I?
I can go on and on, but I have 2500 characters to type. I can say that depression now stays with me like a cancer partly because not every depressed person is a friend!

Hi everyone,
It's been months that I'm going through depression and anxiety.  It first happened to me few years back. 
Somehow fought it and came out of it slowly. But it came back with more power.
Every time when I go through this phase I isolate from everything that I love, isolate me from friends. 
Because its the experiences I had made me like this. So the inner me doesn't wanna face that again.
For me, the hardest part of depression is accepting that I'm going through depression and I can't work or act like normal days.
Because I grew up in a world where the word 'depression'  'anxiety' is something people doesn't want to talk about.
Sometimes I accept I'm having depression and I will get out of this one day and be more strong.  And not everyone is lucky enough to go through this. One positive thing I could get from this phase I can totally relate to what another person facing depression is going through.

Here I am trying the find one single positive thing desperately and people around me laughing at me. 
I know its hard to understand what I'm going through. But can you at least stop judging something you don't know?
When I took the courage to accept my mental state, I have people around me calling me liar and someone who is seeking attention.
I shut down myself from everything and I was isolating myself from everything and what I got is 'LIAR'.
And I'm starting to doubting myself whether I made all this up. No, I didn't. I do have some traumatic events in my life. Maybe it's silly for others, But I couldn't take it. Because I always wished a simple world where I can feel secure, I can be myself. No there is no such world!

I'm hoping for a world where Depression is not a taboo. And someone won't laugh at me when I tell them I'm going through depression!
I have been seeing nightmares. But these days the biggest nightmare is the friend who laughed at me when I said him I'm having depression and people calling me a liar.

Can someone give me a break? I'm not able to solve my real problem in the midst of these!!
Best
Black Sheep

Hi All 
Im 26 years old and have been suffering from depression for quite some time now. I have trouble forming relationships both friend and romantic because of my depression. Im depressed and mainly lonely as although being 26 have never had a long term relationship actually the longest and only  relationship ive ever had has only been one month which makes me think there is something wrong with me. when i was younger i could make friends easily but have always struggled with romantic relationships. I dont go out that often anymore as i dont enjoy myself when im out. Basically have a massive feeling of feeling useless, the lack of companionship and loneliness in my life has made me feel and believe that i am unlovable and will always be , struggling to find the positives to keep going as now and for a while the negatives have definitely outweighed the positives.

I have a supportive partner and family who always try their best, but it's so relentless struggling with bipolar symptoms and treatment. My current problem is how to be 'normal' while going through major drug changes. I am so tired I can't get out of bed in the morning. I've got shakes, zaps and tearfulness. It's so hard to go to work. I have just lied and said i have had gastro for two weeks! That makes me ashamed. Does anyone have tips on how to better manage drug changes?  Thank you for any help you can give. Xx

So I’m kind of new to this but I’ll try my best.
for the past 2 years I’ve been feeling really depressed, obviously not all the time but more than I would like aha. Last year I was in a really bad place to where I needed counselling, but I didn’t really like being there so I just acted fine and I was fine, for a few months until I started feeling depressed again and I’ve felt this way ever since. 
I don’t want to feel like this, it ruins my days and I just feel tired all the time. I think I should see someone to try and get medication but whenever I try and go see someone I get really anxiety and I can’t go into the hospital, it’s almost like a panic attack. I also don’t want to tell me parents that I’m back in that state because they were so hurt last year, I don’t want to put them through anything like that again, so I’m trying to do it by myself. My friends don’t know about it, but I’m thinking about telling them instead of my parents. Since I’m 18 it should be fine to get the medication by myself right? 
anyway I’m just kinda asking what I should do, kinda lost at the moment and I’m looking for help 🙃

Survival, what an ultimatum of a word. But in my 63 years I have survived and gone further, how to remain strong and healthy while enduring depression. 

Treatment. Yes, you might be doing the best you can- consider returning to your GP to tweek those meds, a care plan to talk things over with a professional and so on.
Stability. IMO the most delicate area of maintaining stability is other people be it there negative influence or our own problems like intolerance or intrusive thoughts that we tend to end up paranoid about. https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/online-forums/relationship-and-family-issues/fortress-of-survival
Environment. Uprooting your family to move to a strange place isnt good for stability but if done wisely that improves your standard of living, it can be life changing that could minimalise moods and depressive episodes.
Hobbies and sports. A passion has to come from within, no one can advise you which passion to choose, but if you were to find one then this is a major distraction to your illness. Talking endlessly about our illness often leads to counter productivity. Distraction and keeping busy is good keeping your mind occupied.
Conflict resolution. We tend to argue more than others as we are not well. Find strategies that work for both of you to resolve. Consult relationship counseling. Here is one idea-   https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/online-forums/relationship-and-family-issues/relationship-strife-the-peace-pipe#qmy1OnHzvGGEbv8AAOnT_A
Acceptance. Easy to say. We are who we are. Our depression is as part of us as our limbs. It is unlikely to go on a planned holiday. Better to accept it with its ups and downs and be more at peace.   https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/online-forums/staying-well/accepting-yourself-the-frog-and-the-scorpion#qi1Wu3HzvGGEbv8AAOnT_A
Relaxation. Includes holidays, even one night away with a campfire looking at stars can rejuvenate you and kids love it. Consider a camping unit like a camper trailer or start with a tent
Expectations. Please dont expect others to understand your illness. That's what this forum is for, to share your problems. Care for your carer
Inner peace. By far in the last 30 years my development personally has been invaluable in the form of spirituality (non religion). To appreciate what I have not what I dont. https://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/online-forums/staying-well/meditation---words-of-wisdom---it-helped-me-for-25-years#qe4ivHHzvGGEbv8AAOnT_A

I’ve started a new job that sounded promising but it turns out it’s just a total slog (physically intense, no opportunity to use my knowledge and experience in the field which I thought I could)
More often than not I would just rather be dead. Suicide isn’t an option because that would be slack to my fiance
Im a poor partner in my relationship because I’m often angry, upset, numb, accusing or jealous. We have been together for almost ten years but now there is no intimacy. 
Nothing seems to go right, can’t be happy. Just don’t know what to do anymore
Have organised a free counselling session/meeting with Beyond Blues assistance program but only available dates are during work. Also organised a mental health plan with my GP to arrange free counselling but I haven’t heard from them. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore. I give up.

Hi, not sure whether this is the right thing to do?
I have no one else to speak with, about how things are with my position.
I know I have allowed things in my life to way me down, to the point where, I can not seem to see the way out.
Some days are better than others, I find great solace, in the animals in my life, of which are many, mostly wild.
I seem to feel great empathy and sadness for the hopelessness, I see in all things around me, and take it on board.
I try to help others of all species, and cant help myself. Once, I was the most trusting of all that I met, and gave of everything I could freely and honestly, only to be tossed aside each time.
And still, I leave myself open to the users and the self indulged, blinded to there indifference, I accept there words and smooth ways.
It's in disbelief, and distrusting suspicion that I thrive now, detached and isolated from all but nature, in that I trust.
It's very hard to describe the way of things, but in this way I remain distant and detached, where it's safe.
I still have to endure dramas and problems in my life due to commitments and responsibility's every day.
I hide well my ashamed self, and put up a good front to all those I deal with every day, at arms length.
A social life I have none, interacting with others closely none, alone in mind, alone in body, alone in spirit.
Have recently been accumulating my rubbish around me on display, so as to remind me what I am.
Sorry to burden any who read this with my silliness, but would like any comments, may be out of all the self analysis, other views and opinions or experiences may help me turn around this endlessness.
 I know I have much more to give in many ways, but cant get the pointlessness out of me!!
With much respect and a kind heart, Thank You.

Hey, I'm new on here but wanted to let people know what I'm going 
Through. I have just recently moved out of the family home to work
On my mental health, and now it has created an even bigger 
Separation between me and my wife. It just feels like everything I
Do or say to her at the moment sets her off. I know I haven't been
Very pleasant to live with at times but I am trying to deal with it
This time and it's been hard. Will she forgive me down the track
If I give her space or am I destend to be lonely. I do have two beautiful
Teenage kids and they are very understanding of what's going on.
They also can't understand why there mum is being this way either
But I just tell them, she is scared and worried about me, 
Am I wrong?

I'm new to posting here about my experiences, but this is my fourth or fifth year living with depression? (I think)
It's been a pretty steady decline these past few years; to the point where these changes have been so gradual, that these avoidant/anxiety relieving behaviours (declining social things, social anxiety, over eating,(not good food either), over sleeping, over thinking, drinking (not too much, but drinking to get drunk nonetheless), have crept their way in so silently, that I feel like a 'new me' has come to exist. And now, its like one small part of me thinks 'hang on, what has just happened' (kind of like a house party that has gone of for 4 years straight, and you're now starting to notice the unsavoury types that have made their way in to your house).
I've very strategically (and cleverly might I add) constructed a social circle around me that doesn't exist, so I don't have to endure socialising and enjoying things. This in turn develops deep anxiety within me, as i'm becoming increasingly aware of this passage of time that is quickly being filled with my inaction to do things I enjoy, seeing people I want to see, sustaining relationships in general. It truly has reached a point where me sitting around all day, watching videos and movies on the internet mindlessly as I quietly acknowledge the fact about how im wasting my life away in a digital world of never-ending entertainment and getting my dopamine hit, rather than facing my problems, has become my life (PS: if anyone has any good tips of overcoming YouTube/movie/internet addiction, because my impulsiveness tells me it is an addiction, I would really appreciate that)
The fact that I have recently decided to quit my job as a primary school teacher without any idea of other things I want to do is also snowballing things right now. Teaching is something I love, but it feels that my nervous system is so shot that I cant even concentrate sufficiently, which is a must with school kids. My mind is clouded, I'm stressed about income, the fact that im cloudy about thinking about what I want to do flares up anxiety, which makes me clouded with anxiety rather than coming up with solutions (feedback loop from hell, if anyone has read The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***, great book ). I feel a general hum of confusion and career misdirection. I guess im just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar spot that I am right now, and if anyone could help a fellow struggler out, cause I am struggling.

Hi All
I am seeking advice to deal with depression from this thread. 
The story goes I am currently seeing this girl for over two months now, I think she likes me but when I trying to ask about her feelings, the answer was uncertain. Only until very recently I found that she has been depressed for a while, I don't think it a major depression, but she doesn't feel attracted to anyone at moment and she wasn't at her best/her prefer states. Of course, I want to continue seeing her, even though we rarely have physical contact (I mean holding hands).  I also want to help her get out of depression regardless of the outcome whether we will continue dating or not.
Because I have little or no experience in dealing with depression in my life, I am here seeking valuable advice from the community. What should I do in this situation? She refused to go out (I mean like meeting other people), she told me she is having difficult thoughts like low self-esteem, stressed, and life in general. 
Please, if you have experience in how to help a depressed person or you been through the same state, leave your advice/recommendation.
 
Thank you
 
Steve

I’m new and haven’t really spoken to anyone about my anxiety/depression. I was diagnosed with PTSD/PND when my first child was born 9 years ago and after a short period on medication I came off it and tried to manage on my own. 9 years and 3 kids later and I am a total wreck. 
I’m an overthinker, have regular panic attacks that come out of the blue and alternate between angry/overly happy and super down very quickly. 
My kids deserve a happy, fun mum who takes them out places rather than a mum who panics if our routine isn’t followed or we are out the house too long. 
I have periods of time where I am totally numb to everything, like I have passed the panic stage and have just given up on everything. Social interaction at the moment is just in the too hard basket and I don’t have the energy to think about getting help. I would be happy just to crawl into a hole and not come out. 

and that’s me. I feel a bit better writing it as I don’t have anyone in my life that cares. Thanks for reading :)

   For 12 years until recently I was a carer for my now ex disabled partner doing everything for her, helping her in and out of bed, in and out of bed, on and off the toilet, cleaning and bathing her, cooking, washing, cleaning as well as spemding time with the kids and working for her father which didn't leave much time for myself.  I ended up tired, depressed and was at the point where I didn't care anymore and wasn't looking after myself, lost touch of who I am, what I wanted in life.
    As I mentioned, I have recently moved out, still Depressed and suffering with Anxiety, gave up working with her father after the years of being treated like crap from him put-downs every day, verbal abuse and put-downs and dodging flying cups, plates and knifes most days, thing was getting pretty toxic.
    Now I am away from what I say was a toxic situation, I am still suffering with Depression and Anxiety, with not working and trying to live on Newstart which is $550 per fortnight and alot of free time on my hands I tend to think too much about things that's happened.
    I feel like now I  away from that toxic situation/relationship I have lost touch with who I am, what I want in life, and being I have a low self-esteem and low confidence levels form put-downs and verbal abuse I don't know how to build up my confidence and self-esteem.
    What can I do? Where do I start? How do I find who I am again? 
    I hate feeling depressed, I hate anxiety, I want to be alone alot of the time when I should be spending time with my new partner of near 2 months now

I highly recommend reading “why we sleep” by Matthew Walker. 
the importance of rest and sleep just can’t be overlooked. 
I have just recently started antidepressants, after trying to manage without them for most of the year. I’ve been reading, and trying to prioritise healthy eating and enough sleep.
also important and fascinating, helpful books are 
“good to go” by Christie Aschwanden about the science of recovery (focusses on the physical but does not at all overlook the intertwined nature of mental and physical being)
”can you die of a broken heart” by cardiothoracic surgeon Dr Nikki Stamp.
 
also, how quickly can SNRI meds start to effect a person? Within days? Positively or side effects...

Hey all,
I'm new, and this will be my first time posting on any forum of any kind, so it does seem a bit strange.
I'm a university student, just about to turn 21. 
I've had several injuries over the past year or so that have prevented me from exercising, and my girlfriend cheated on me as well. I don't really have any close friends; I've never really had any close friends. 
I saw a psychologist for the first time this week as my feelings of hopelessness and loneliness were beginning to be unbearable. I struggle constantly to display my emotions or to even feel anything. I don't feel comfortable talking to any of my friends about how I'm feeling or anything like that. I've obviously never been formally diagnosed with anything, as I've only just started seeing this psychologist, so even now I feel I'm being overdramatic.
I thought going to the psychologist was going to make me feel better, but I feel far worse. I never talk about my fears or feelings to anyone and confronting them like that has made me feel even more hopeless and lonely over the past couple of days. 
What's happened to everyone else on the forum once they start asking for help. I feel more isolated than ever.
Thanks for being out there whoever it is.

Haven’t posted here in a while. It’s not that I’ve gotten any better unfortunately, just forgot this account existed until I needed advice haha.
For context, I met a guy online. We’ve been friends for a while now. In the beginning we were very close. People would rarely see us apart, and if we were, they’d ask where the other person was. We would message almost constantly - he’d say good morning, I’d do the same, we’d talk on call for hours. Lately, it feels like things have changed.
Recently he decided he wanted to start making videos. Having no knowledge of how to edit himself, I agreed to help. (I don’t know if that’s related to the issue, but context.)
He made less of an effort to initiate conversation, and if we did talk over text, he’d be cold. And the only time he’d contact me was to ask about “our” work. He started to ignore me in game too, even if I tried to team up, it’d be met with dismissal.
I didn’t address my issues at first, trying to avoid causing him trouble. I just let the thoughts intrusively fester in my own mind until, finally, I got fed up and confronted him. He reassured me things were the same, that I was one of his “best friends”. And for a little while I was at ease. He started to invite me occasionally, we would talk less about work and he’d initiate conversations.
And then everything went back to how it had been.
He’d ignore me, only text first to talk about work, reject me. I was back to feeling neglected and miserable.
He’s so two faced, being cold over text, but charming on call. The back and forth is sending me on a roller coaster ride of emotions.
I think deep down I know, he’s just keeping me around for his videos, that this isn’t good for me. But, if it wasn’t already obvious, I’m smitten with him. (Stupid, crushing on someone online, I know.) And like all things we love, admitting they might be bad for us feels almost impossible. At least for me.
It’s not just my feelings hindering my judgement, I felt like with this guy I had someone I could confide in, trust. A real friend. Now it just feels like I’m being used and I’m too desperate for him to just admit the truth.
Why is he so cold over text, but acts so warm over call? Why does he go from being affectionate - praising and encouraging me - to just ignoring me? One second he makes me feel like I’m on top of the world, and like shit the next. I don’t know what to do anymore.
Sorry this got so long and rambley, I guess I just needed a place to vent my thoughts.

Good Morning,
Just a quick note to introduce myself.
 I am new to this forum, in fact I am new to any online forum!
Quick back story, I had a Panic Attack early this year, first one for nearly a decade. Left me shocked, bewildered, depressed and severely anxious.
 I have improved over the last few months, but still suffering from the aftershock which I means I am still battling with Anxiety and associated Depression. 
Looking forward to chatting.

Hi all,

I have been having 'episodes' of an adrenaline rush when I consider my own mortality.

If I start thinking about death I get an overwhelming sadness.

I sometimes feel like I am in a bubble of reality, like I can feel how small we all are in the universe.

I get scared. I get very sad. Lately I have had it alot.


I keep wanting to scream. I keep crying.

I am on medication. I used to be on a higher dose but it didn't stop these thoughts from happening and overwhelming me.

What can I do? Has anyone ever felt like this? I am not religious and just cannot convince myself to believe in them.

I and on my last unit of a Diploma but I can't possibly finish it this year and it is the second time I have tried it. I'm not really doing anything wrong, just have a lot of other stuff going on and trying to stay sane as well - you know how it is.  
I think I am being bloody minded and trying to finish because I should and I'm really upset I won't but by the same token, I want to move on with my life and have other things staring me in the face that need doing. 
I don't see a job from it any time soon if ever. 
I'm just not sure it is worth the mental energy to finish but I think I'm going to feel I let myself down by not getting there in the end.

Hi,
 
I am 18 and was diagnosed with bipolar type II over a year ago for which I have been on medication for since, which as helped enormously.
However I am worried because last night when I was driving home from work, I saw an entire house engulfed in flames on a hill in front of me, yet there has been no record of this happening on DFES, which there would be, and I drove past the same spot today and I couldn't see any sign of this being real .
I have never hallucinated before and there have been no changes to anything in my life and I am worried that I won't be able to tell the difference between reality and fiction. I often feel sort of dissociated, like I'm watching myself or not fully present in life, but I have learnt to live with that.
Overall I have been doing really well for the last 2 months, but this has me freaking out. I even called the fire department (it's in my call log so I know that is real) but because I didn't know exactly where it was as it was up on the hill, they couldn't do anything. 
Some advice on if this is normal and if I should be worried about progression of symptoms from other bipolar II people would be amazing!!
I am quite shaken up and would love some feedback...
cheers

Ok... I'm having all sorts of issues with how to describe to a very helpful, caring and supportive family member that when I'm going through an extremally depressive episode, I find it impossible to communicate with the outside world.
Whether an episode is days or weeks, I just roll myself into a ball and sleep... I can't cope with anything. 
Yet my relative can't seem to comprehend why I ""can't just send a text""... no matter which way I explain it, it just doesn't get through. What am I doing wrong?

Hi

I'm female 29. Been in a relationship with current partner for 5 years.
In 2015 he was unfairly arrested on a plane that I was on too over a misunderstanding with staff and police.
For most of 2016-2017 we had a long distance relationship.
In 2017 I visited him while he was overseas. We traveled around SE Asia. He had a friend who was staying at his apartment while we were away who killed himself.

Until late 2017 my partner returned home with me after he had a mental breakdown. I traveled overseas to take him home. He was arrested at the airport for pending court case from 2015 and bailed to my parents house because we had no where to stay.

By mid 2018 he was imprisoned for 4 months.
I would visit him from interstate every 2 weeks over the weekend.
I've been helping him deal with the problems in his life and it has been exhausting.
He has hurt in his life and has hurt me emotionally.
I understand hurt people hurt people.
I am a very patient and understanding person to have gone through a lot with my partner.

Things have calmed down and we are getting our lives back together. We are renting a new place after staying at our parents. We are looking for jobs as we have been on social security for a while. We eat healthy and have better ways of communicating with each other. We both want to move forward.

However sometimes I have anxiety and depression. I'm afraid of bad things happening.
Although by nature I am a shy or reserved person I feel a particular discomfort around other people and don't know how to interact with people anymore.
The experiences I've had and the support I give to my partner make me feel a bit isolated.
I don't really have anyone to talk to because I feel no one I know really understands my feelings or the experiences I've had supporting someone I care about who has gone to prison and has some mental health issues too due to trauma maybe. We also recently found out he has Hepatitis C which he will begin treatment for this week.. I've been tested and I'm clear. But it was so stressful. When he got out of prison I thought the stress would be over but the experience still hurts and still lingers.
I used to be interested in producing music but I've lost interest in creativity. I don't listen to music anymore.

I just had to express myself here.

My partner will organise seeing a counselor and I am considering seeing one too .
life is strange.
thanks for reading

Hi All,
Im needing some advice on how to deal with my home life.    I was diagnosed with BP in 2006. It has been an extremely rough road finding the right medication balance but i got there .  My partner of 7 years has a stressful job and a very demanding 12 yr old son who comes to stay with us every second week.  I understand the stresses that my partner faces as we work in the same industry field , however my partner is always extremely stressed and everyday i find myself hiding away as its the worst trigger with my Bipolar.  He is a wonderful man , however quite self focused on his own day to day workings.   Over all the years i have communicated with him the best i can about Bipolar disorder, given him booklets , website links , taken him to appointments and advised him of triggers etc etc.the last 2 months  through a medication adjustment because of getting older and its been extremely difficult with the side effects and just trying to be aware of my behaviour in the household and trying not to affect everyone,,, its been tough!   The main issue is , my partner will come home every night and unload a huge amount of venting stress on me from the day he has had at work,, usually by the time hes finished venting he rarely asks me how Im feeling or even how my day was.  By the time hes finished,im so exhausted from taking on a days worth of his stress, i will go and sit under a running shower and cry my eyes,out then move around quietly for the rest of the evening walking on egg shells in the hope of not starting up another venting session i have to listen too.   Im at the point that i dont want to go home in the evening just so i dont have to drown in his stress another day longer.  He is very aware that his stress is one of the biggest triggers as we've discussed it numerous times but it just doesn't change anything.   some evenings i will get up and walk away mid conversation as i just cant take the negative venting any longer ,, then he will realise its too much ,, but avoid me like i have the plaque for the rest of the evening.  I feel im the one doing the supporting role but when i require the support , its simply not available to me as he virtually has no room left mentally to accommodate my stress or issues and give support.  How can i change this toxic routine and get the loving support i need sometimes as the episodes ive had over the last few years have been brought on by his stress

Hi everyone, 
This is my first post so thank you for reading. I would very much appreciate anyone who may have answers or have been in a similar situation to shed some light on why I am thinking the way I am. 
Lately, I have been feeling depressed and worthless finding it hard to find motivation about nearly everything. I am confused about why I am feeling this way as I have so many good things in my life and should feel lucky and happy to have them. A couple of years ago my partner and I built our first home, I am married to an amazing supporting wife, I have a full-time job, I am studying a degree at university part-time and we are both in good health. I am very grateful for all these things and there are no issues there. But, I find myself thinking about how worthless I am on a daily basis. I feel as though anyone who meets me does not like me and looks down on me like I am also worthless. Some days I find myself about to burst into tears for no apparent reason and then start thinking how my family would probably not miss me that much if anything happened to me. My wife does not know how bad I feel some days as I try to keep my head up and hide everything, pretending I am ok. In recent years I left the defence force and have become very anti-social. It wasn't until a year ago I realised I did not have any friends which sounds a bit sad. I used to have heaps of friends and a very active social life but feel as though no-one has much time for me anymore. These feelings of worthlessness and sad thoughts keep getting worse as time goes on. I have not thought of suicide but instead, I think of how I got to this point. I feel like I should not be complaining about anything in my life and nothing is actually wrong but I feel as though I am sinking and cannot get out of this point in my life. I admit I am embarrassed to talk about this to anyone being a typical bloke and ex-defence soldier because I don't want anyone I know to judge me.

Hey to anyone is for some reason looking at this
 
I have been having many episodes of depression for months. It is about all the arguing with my friends. I never showed it, but i have been depressed. Recently, the bomb hit. One of my best friend stabbed me in the back by saying they were not my friend anymore. The entire friendship group was broken. One of my friends decided to move on and go find new friends. But me and the lat friend were the only ones who were really disturbed by what had happened. I have been depressed in my head for months, but I was sick of keeping my emotions inside and started showing my feelings. Tired, grumpy and not listening. My parents called my lazy, but they don't understand. The only person i have told is the friend who stuck by my side. I keep thinking that it is my fault. As my only friend and the friend who broke up with me became friends again. It hit me like a ton of bricks. The friend who broke up with the whole group didn't want to be MY FRIEND! I have been depressed and I don't know what to do. The days keep dragging on and i feel sad almost every minute.
i don't know how to tell my parents and i have no idea what to do! If you have any suggestions they are very much appreciated!
thank you for whoever s wasting their time on hearing this.

Thank you
If it wasnt for beyond blues call line I wouldn't be alive right now.  I suffered alone and in silence with severe depression and anxiety issues for over a decade before it all became too much an I attempted to take my own life. Luckily I survived and got the help I needed , doctors medication and support from your great organization. I lost alot because of my suicide attempt, my fiance, the love of my life left me, my depression had taken too much of a toll on her, I cant blame her really. I must admit I again thought about taking my own life when she left thankfully many calls to the support line got me through it. 
Today im much happier,  i used to be unemployed unable to leave my house (rented) and unable to find much happiness in anything but now just over a year since my suicide attempt I'm running my own online advertising firm with a few solid clients and looking to take on far more. I'm happy, able to leave my house ( still renting) and enjoy the outdoors. I miss my ex fiance deeply I dont think that will ever change but thanks to you amazing people at beyond blue I now know I have a future, I have goals, (something I've never had before) I want to buy my own place, build my advertising firm up and I want to get to a place that I'm well off enough that I can give back to the community and help others that are struggling with depression. I guess that's part of what this post is, it's a thank you to beyond blue and hopefully an eye opener to those reading it because trust me if this is something that I can do then you can to.

As mentioned I work for a Trillion dollar company. Who takes customer importance over their employees. Essentially as an employee you can do nothing right, well not with a manager like mine. You can be abused, sworn at,  see graphic nature pictures, and its like oh well you'll be right take another call, and don't stay offline for longer than two minutes.
I am stuck in a lowest form of depression once again as I am applying for jobs which I was once  very skilled for, but now since working for this company nobody seems to want to hire me I am lucky if I get to interview stage. I know I never want to do this type of role again ever in my life  though and discourage anyone else from it.
I am sick of being abused everyday and people not accepting responsibility for their own actions.
I dunno what to do, I have given up at this point, I used to be very skilled and would pick up a job within one or two interviews, thought this would be a good move a a short amount of time, oh how I was wrong. It's like an Australian sweat shop where there is no care, no responsibility for the employee. No debrief if you have a bad call etc. It just get back on the phones and deal with it.
Anyway enough of my complaining, needed to vent. Going to take something and have a sleep. Yes just a sleep. 
Although I do want to run away from society and go live in the wilderness with my dogs and have nothing to do with it. I think the world population is gaining more and more people who feel entitled and show no regard for the person they are speaking with and want to blame other for their mistakes.
Thanks

I've suffered with mental
health issues for many years now. First, it was anger issues, but after I came
out as trans that disappeared. Then it was major depression and anxiety. I
stayed at a psych ward for a couple weeks for suicidal tendencies when I was
16, and then a Y-PARC when I was 18. 
After so many years of
struggling, I lost my ability to trust. All the psychs and therapists I have
ever seen have only ever looked at me with pity and judgement, and several of
them have outright betrayed my trust in them. The last one I saw decided I was
too high risk, and forced my mother and brother to leave their jobs early so
that I could be taken to hospital two hours away. Once there we had to wait
three hours before I was seen by anyone, where I was promptly turned away
because there was nothing they could do to help me. I got over that - rather, I
accepted that nobody would help. 
This year I've struggled,
but I've gotten my life together. Although I did quit my job, it was for the
best. Verbal abuse from customers and the occasional manager (I worked at
McDonald's) was slowly driving me insane. I'm at uni, and have a course set for
my ideal career as a Chaplain in the Defence Force. I'm also highly involved in
my Church. My faith is what saved my life, and God is the only reason I live.
But I still hurt. Each time I think I'll talk to somebody, open up and tell the
truth, I can't. I can't trust professionals, I can't trust my friends, I can't
trust my family. But I also can't trust myself. I've still got two assignments
and an online exam to complete for this semester, and I keep putting them off
because I can't focus. I can feel myself becoming emotionally detached. 
Even as I write this, I can
feel myself falling apart. These last two days, whenever I look at myself in a
mirror, I don't recognise the man looking back at me. I see a stranger. I don't
even know what I look like anymore. I know I need help. I have an un-diagnosed
eating disorder, nicotine addiction, and I'm also probably developing a
drinking problem. But I can't get help. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Hi, 
I've worked as a nurse at a public hospital for 30 Years. Struggling with treatment resistant depression the last couple of years.  Motivation finally improving but not coping well  at work. Have a supportive, but junior manager who has made some temporary accommodations for me but management are saying to continue to do so would be unfair on the other staff and  I'm supposed to be finding a position ""more suitable"".  I applied recently for a job in a less challenging area of the hospital but was unsuccessful.  A very stressful situation at work last week resulted in a worsening of my condition and I'm now taking some (more) sick leave. My question is, do I now ask for a formal HR process to  assist (""manage"" me)? I havent done so untill now as my psychiatrist advised strongly me against it, saying they would ""F*&*k me up"", deliberately  put me in a position I hate in order to get rid of me. I know this does happen. His advice was to actively seek other employment myself . I'm at the point of needing (small) doses of a sedative at work to calm my thinking which really is dangerous and untenable. Taking leave has not been of any benefit work-wise and I need some more permanent changes. I am planning to see a psychologist to assist with coping strategies. What are people's experience with HR processes at work? Should I push for a more formal process? I know I'm within my rights.

Hi. First time on here, but really it's my last option. Two years back when I was 16, out of the blue I felt as if I just couldn't think properly anymore and felt like I had lost all emotional responses to things. Previously easy social interactions became a challange, like that natural flow of ideas and thoghts was just gone. At the same time my sleep went to crap. Like two hours of sleep every second night. waited for it to pass but it never did, I also thought it may have been that medication I was taking for my adhd had stopped working. Got my doctor to change my adhd medication but it did nothing to improve these issues.
Doctor put me on antidepressants and I think I was diagnosed with depression. So far I've tried multiple different medications. None of them have done much to improve these issues. It's been 2 years now, been on 4 antidepressants, been to 3 specialist and 2 psychologists, and no one has given me a straight answer to what's causing my issues. My sleep issues have went away, but nothing else has. Either I'm crazy or they're avoiding my questions.
So yeah, that's where I'm at, still don't know what's wrong with me.
Thanks
-Matt

I feel so alone sometimes. So unloved and uncared for, forgotten and ignored. There is a dark fog over me.. and I cant find my way out. Talking about it just makes it worse. Will I ever get back to my normal self? Will I even get out, or will I be trapped here forever?

It feels like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders. It was scary, don't get me wrong, but I think it's because I've spent so long feeling like I've been judged. I know I really had nothing to worry about in the end. My doctor was amazing
 We've got a plan and I'm seeing the psychologist in a couple of weeks. The first avaliable appointment that was there.

I don't need to bore you all with the details, although I can if you really want to. I just wanted to share this with you all, just to let you know that if you are considering seeing your GP, please do so. Just opening up to mine felt like a whole new world . I'm nervous, but excited at what the future holds. 

I've spent almost my entire life putting others first, that was how I was brought up from the time I could walk and talk. I've never looked after myself. To a point I love helping and caring about other people, i guess that's why I'm taking this step. To put me  first for once. I feel like I can't stress this enough, please, to everyone reading this, put yourself first. It's the best thing you can do. It's a small step,but finally I might be able to see some light at the end of the tunnel. 

Much love and best wishes to everyone.

BB linked me here from a post I replied to on Facebook. If they saw what I recently posted on my own FB page, they'd probably be alarmed. A good mate also recommended that I get help. I hope I haven't let him down.

My brain has broken before - not literally of course. See I suffer from depression, and I'm on the autism spectrum; specifically I have Aspergers. I'm also 35, single, and gay. That's quite a mixed bag of ""goodies"".

I'm already on anti-depressant meds, and they're barely working. I've been on them since 2010. I don't know if any other medication would help.

I seem fixated on having a partner sometimes. All I want is someone special to be with me until the end. But no matter how many times I try to find that someone, it never works. People say ""there's someone for everyone"" or ""you never know what's around the corner"", but I don't believe that anymore. Yet at other times, I couldn't care less if I have anyone or not. The feeling, the want, it comes and goes.

I don't know what else to say. I'm honestly not sure if anyone can help. But I suppose if anyone can try to help, maybe BB can.

This is my first time posting. 
I have had depression on and off for many years. This year I think has been my worst. I struggle with keeping my 'sadness' under control and usually immerse myself in my work which has always helped. I like to be busy. This year though I think I have suffered 'burn out' and work has not been so enjoyable. I just don't seem to enjoy anything....work, food, friends, tv. I have confided in family and my Dr (all of whom are very supportive) but nothing seems to be 'working' for me. 
Just feel a bit lost and like it will never be better.
I decided to let my bosses in on the fact that I thought I was doing too much and needed to not do so much.....this was a mistake and now they think I am 'not coping' and I feel like they are attaching stigma....always referring to my 'not coping'. I wish I had not said anything now as I feel like they will always think this now.
I feel like I have let myself down admitting it...was it wrong to be honest? 
And will I get better? Advice on how to lift myself back up again when I am finding everything hard and just want to avoid life???

Hi everyone,
I have been dealing with depression/anxiety for a long time (I am currently not seeking help for it due to financial reasons) but over the recent years, it has become a real hindrance to my school work and potential career prospects.
I am doing a creative arts degree that I really love; I love what I am being taught and the processes but I just cannot bring myself to complete my work or sometimes attend lectures; I feel so inadequate compared all of the other students that are producing high quality, industry-standard work yet I can barely sketch or produce work I feel is quality, so I just don't hand my work in. I then hate myself because I feel I cannot produce work to the same standards as the others and feel I don't belong there; I am also terrified of speaking to my lecturers because I feel they dislike me and think I am pathetic for constantly coming up with pathetic excuses when so many other students can cope but I can't...

I am worried that because I am so awful at what I do that I won't make it in the industry I want to enter and I am becoming too old to change my career path or try something else. I hate that I can't just be like all of the other students and produce work they are happy with...I want to be motivated again and feel like I actually have a chance in this industry that I love so much. I want this fear of failure and self-doubt to disappear and to be able to function as a human being again; I have so many sleepless nights because my brain goes into overdrive and tells me I am doomed to be a jobless wannabe for the rest of my life and to just give up. It has gotten so bad that I have to sleep with headphones on and listen to music to fall asleep and keep the voices at bay.
I just want to function again, I want to be proud of myself for once and feel like I can achieve something. I just don't know where to go or what to do anymore, I just want to feel normal again.
Thanks for reading.

Hi,
Im not sure how to start with these things..
I just want to get things off my chest to complete strangers because I feel like it’s the last resort.. Everyone I’ve talked to or tried to has dismissed everything I’ve said and how I’m feeling except one person who is always far away from me to do anything to help except to listen to me cry over the phone. I’m just feeling gutted, sad but really sad like the top part of my chest / heart feels empty but the bottom feels very heavy and painful. I just see the point in life if there’s too many bad than good happening.

Hi there. I have been diagnosed with depression since 2011. Depression runs in the family. My mum has it and my brother has it. I have been on anti-depressants since 2012. 
My concern of lately has been my career. I have been a job hopper, with my longest ever job being at 2 years and that was a casual position which did not require me to be on the job regularly. I find myself feeling very down and out about work. I have worked full time but have never seem to find a full time job which I have stayed in for more than 5 months. I let my work overtake my life..... Those close to me have told me that they are sick of hearing about my work and the problems that I have there. I think to myself...how can some people stay so long in their jobs and I cant?
I have come to the conclusion that maybe I am not meant to be working full time. I should go back to part time or casual...30 hours a week would be enough. But even so...I think I have a problem with job hopping. I always feel that when I have a problem with a ""somebody"" it escalates and I end up leaving the job...""running away"" rather than to be unhappy and face my problems.
I have also come into some realisation that maybe it is also my depression which has affected my career. I tend to opt for lowly skilled jobs, even though I am a uni graduate....This reason being that work stress gets to much for me and causes me to go into an episode of depression. 
Has anyone had a similar experience in which their depression may have impacted their career/work??? How have you overcome this problem and where can I seek help? Please let me know.

Hi All,
This is the first time i've done somethingl ike this, i believe i am depressed and possibly severely for a few years.
It's gotten pretty bad the last few months and started after i lost my two grandparents with whom i was pretty close with and lived with them for a year last year, anyways i took a few days off work just cause i was a bit upset, and those few days turned into what is now nearly three months, where i've only gone back 4-5 days in total.
I just stay in my room and dont leave the house, i sleep alot nearly 10-12 hours a day and get nervous at the thought of going out and seeing people, im afraid to tell people how im feeling because i feel like they wont understand or just tell me im dumb and to get over it, i feel like a burden, my parents dont know any of this, they dont know im not going to work, my dad would just laugh at me, i told my mum today that i'm going to a GP tonight to speak about a mental health care plan as someone suggested Anti Depressants might be a good place to start.
 
My boss at work called me last week to chat and he was pretty supportive which suprised me, told me to come in the next day and we can chat and said to not feel pressured to stay the whole day at work, i ended up making an excuse as i always do the next morning and ignored his calls the following day (This was just last week)
I received an email from HR today about a formal absent meeting which will cover all my days i've had off and not being in contact with any of them, i think communication on my end is a big issue as i just feel like they dont believe me and think im lying.
I'm constantly down, i feel lonely and im pretty overweight, i comfort eat alot and have been doing that for years. I think the weight plays a big part in how im feeling, but usually it doesnt bother me as people aren't too much of an asshole these days.
Basically the thought of going to work scares me, i feel like everyone will talk about me, look at me and just laugh. Im behind in rent/debts and have absolutely no money, my housemate stresses me out to no end and i dont feel comfortable, i feel cold most of the time and my body shakes regularly, i apologise if this thread is all over the place i dont really know how to explain everything in order..
I was just wondering if anyone is experiencing the same kind of thing and knows a way around it?

I feel like im going to lose my job and get kicked out, i cant bring myself to return. I feel like the world hates me

Hello! 
I just want to know how other people handle the same situation as me. I can only assume it’s depression... 
over the past I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety & PTSD. Generally it’s the anxiety and ptsd that tend to run my life, not so much the depression.
Lately at night things have been different. After a long day at work, dealing with children, cleaning etc etc etc. My husband will leave for work (he works nights), I get myself all sorted, finally after a full day of everything, I sit on the couch or on the bed.
And I just feel this overwhelming wave of sadness. Nothing causes it, nothing triggers the feeling. I just sit down and feel sad. I’m not thinking of anything and the sadness doesn’t make me think of anything specific either. Just feel sadness, watch a sad movie and cry by myself type sad. I have felt things before in the past but this sadness just feels different, it’s just so...... lonely, sadness, like someone has died. 
Why is this only happening now? Depression has never been the major disorder in my mental health. Why is it such a different sadness to the usual? Why at night? 
what can I do?? I just feel so sad?

Hello All.
First time poster.

It's great to see that I'm obviously not alone which I knew.

Over the last month I have felt down and sad for reasons I really can't seem to understand.
At times I sit there and tears are about to flow but I stop myself.
I know it not weak, but I feel lost.

I have a great job (albeit demanding), a great family and other extra-curricula activities (coach of footy and cricket teams).

Recently, as stated above I have no motivation to get up each morning, my productivity at work is rapidly decreasing, I dont seem to care as much for my work.
I also have no general motivation for extra-curricula activities including maintaining my lawn which I used to love doing.

I have seen a psychologist once after a referral from my G.P but it was only a 'meet and greet as such.

I want to lock myself up in my room and keep away from people. I start things but have no desire to complete them (can't believe I am forcing myself to do this).

I know I need to address this concern but I feel ultra guilty to be absent from my workers and my family at times to get myself better.

I sit here, typing this thinking of the next thing I have to do and already this is making me sad.
I'm lost.

I'm not really asking questions as such but I would love to understand what could come next for me with some insight from others who may have been in this situation.
I am not sure I will act on it though. I want to get better but I dont know if I want to act upon it (if that makes sense).

Thanks for reading. Ahhhhh.

Hello Everyone..
It’s been 6 yrs since my hubby passed away..even more since my sons flew the coop...and I’m still struggling to motivate myself to do anything..Maybe because it’s just me here and doing things for me is something I’ve never really done before....I was always looking after other people...and their needs..
Living alone with depression/anxiety and C-PTSD....really does overwhelm me at times...and the constant battle of trying to get out of the dark place on my own..can bring on non stop crying....which can get extremely frightening and most times it’s impossible to do things to lift my spirits....I only go out one day a week because of my anxiety..

I really want to ask you..do you get any satisfaction out making things..like new cushion covers, curtains, blankets, clothes etc..or playing internet games,reading..gardening...art.. etc..and how do you get yourself motivated to do them?...especially when no one but you will see the finished result...Is it worth doing these things?..Do you get satisfaction or just feel meh..

Even shopping is difficult..I never know what to buy..because cooking for one is no fun....eating meals alone becomes more of a choir then pleasure...most nights it’s cheese toasties..or a simple salad..or a couple of boiled eggs...food for some reason just doesn’t taste good...and I’m only eating because I need to...

How do others cope with living alone after many years of being in a relationship and your partner and the kids are no longer at home......mine live many hours drive away...and I rarely see them..

I would love to know how other people manage...and if your happy living on your own..or does loneliness become a major problem at times...
I would really appreciate any suggestions on knowing how you you live alone...and if you’re comfortable doing so...I’m having a lot of difficulty..

Kind thoughts..

Grandy...

Hi!
this will be a long one but I really don’t know how to shorten it. I don’t know if i need advice or if I’m just letting it all out, to give my head some much needed space. Plus, with my anxieties I always worry that I seem attention seeking for my post. obviously I know in my heart that it’s not true, in my head it is.
let’s start at the beginning. After a massive panic attack when I was 16 years old, I ended up in hospital and that’s where my journey started. I’m now just over 30 so it’s really hard knowing I have been dealing with this struggle for half my life, half of my life is only fighting to get through another day instead of living. My panic attack was because I was broken up with by a boyfriend who I didn’t realise was mistreating me until a long time later. I honestly feel he is who started my depression and severe anxiety, it all stems back to that.
Anyway! My life hasn’t got a whole lot easier since... dealing with years of depression and anxiety usually can make a person crumble but adding more on top has been a handful.
- my current husband TRIES his absolute hardest to understand and support me. But before I arrived he didn’t believe in mental illness & just thought it was made up in people’s heads for attention. So I do give him sooo much credit for being able to adapt and realise the severity of this illness, but it’s hard to confine and feel understood by someone who once felt that way.
- I’m a step mum, I love it. Their mother is extremely high conflict, she’s caused 8 years of constant and unbearable abuse. We have majority care of the children and they are thriving. But going from no children to 2 was a massive step.
- I now have 2 kids of my own now. I had SEVERE ppd with them, so bad with my first I had to be hospitalised. I did not connect with my child for a long time & the guilt from that is just eating me up inside.
- my oldest step child has severe behavioural issues, adhd & is on the autism spectrum, that’s definitely not something I’m complaining about, but adding that to the mix is hard. I love the child but I’m relied on so much for his support that I throw myself on the back burner to help them, like any mother would! But feeling as terrible as I do in general, when he’s in a “moment” and he says how terrible of a parent I am, how much he hates me and how he wants to kill me is exhausting
I feel like I’m just complaining, but days are getting harder. Yes I see a therapist. But sometimes I just need to know that I’m ok.

Hi guys. I have had a low mood for several months following sustained emotional trauma. i and am getting support from my GP, psychologist and a good friend.
I have a lot of negative self-talk and generally feel very lethargic and flat. People around me sometimes notice and that tends to make me feel really guilty. I feel really bad about myself for feeling bad, though in reality I know it's not through my own fault, it just IS. Yesterday I apologised to my friend for being down and she challenged me on it - I know she was trying to help but it made me feel awkward and worse about myself.
Do you guys go through similar feelings? How do you manage them?

Depression. How does that feeling manage to sneak in under the armour. I swear I got on top of it 2 years ago. The anxiety comes and goes as I have learned to look at it objectively. 
But this time it must have got away, bloody depression. 
It feels like it has been lurking most of my life. Like a monster my mum set on me for being such a horrible child.
I want to pull it out of my gut but it feels like its melted black to my DNA. Its symbiotic. If I cut it off and scrape it free will I die without it? 
If anybody could see my inside they would run away. It is sickening, unlovable, a fraud.
Stupid, dumb, not fit for anyone. Like a moronic animal born without a brain. Evil, toxic.
A selfish, mean spirit closed off to the world..
But these are my mothers words that I learned by rote.

So yeah, I am 44, completely single for 2 years. Realise how I treat partners by pushing them away..I get so scared. I know exactly what I do, so as soon as i find somebody who there is a possibly of something. I mean we have not even been on a a proper date I have emotionaly shut down. 
I know my patterns now so why not fast forward 12 months and just hurt me.
She is better off without me. I know I would be.
I guess I am not ready to open up properly, maybe I never will be. 

Anyway, feel better opening up. Actually thought I had tamed the black dog, but in a way  my walls were just a little taller. 
Tonight I will remove the black monster from my gut. And scrape it free. 
Tomorrow I will visit my ageing mother & remember that she did not give this to me. It escaped from her. My poor mum, who did she get it from. I will never know. But I forgive her without excepting some of her behaviors.
I can accept her love as it is with no expectations. 
And not pass on the bitterness, but just love to my wonderful daughter and everybody else in my life.

If anybody reads this, I'm hoping I'm only as crazy as the rest of the world. I could delete it but maybe somebody can relate..🤗 tomorrow is going to be better.

Hi,


Just posting an update that I hope may be helpful for some. 


After worsening depression and fatigue I finally took a diagnostic sleep study as suggested by my psychiatrist. I am quite a petite female with normal BMI and don’t snore so was quite sceptical and even more surprised to be diagnosed with severe upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS). Sleep apnea and UARS are apparently a common cause of treatment resistant depression and anxiety. After a few months I am finally used to my Cpap treatment and am finding my depression has improved significantly and energy levels have significantly increased. I feel as though I am coming back to life :) Although not a magic cure for everything I still need to watch for depression and anxiety triggers not related to my sleep disorder, things have improved significantly for me with Cpap treatment. 


I just wanted to share this so that anyone struggling might consider asking their GP or psychiatrist for a sleep study. You don’t have to necessarily be overweight or snore to have a sleep breathing disorder. My issues are related to having small jaw, mouth, and airways - leading to airway narrowing. 


Also make sure you get a sleep study that can detect RERAs and UARS not just AHI and Obstructive sleep apnea as just looking at the latter can miss other sleep breathing disorders that can cause mental health issues. 


Although I wish I discovered this earlier and wonder if my life had have been different if it had, I really hope that this can help someone else who is struggling.

Good Morning,
I have never done this before and I am a little bit nervous to do it.
I have known for a little while that I have depression but I have started feeling like I have anxiety and bipolar issues to and I don't know how to deal with it.
I have never told my doctor because I feel embarrassed and I struggle to tell my family and friends because also I feel really embarrassed. When I try to talk to my partner about it it makes me sad because he doesn't understand how I feel and he doesn't really believe in mental illnesses.
At the moment I am really struggling to just get out of bed and to actually do work. I get home from work at 5:30 and sleep all the way until 7:30 in the morning because I don't want to get up. I have gained 15 kilos in 3 months because I am comfort eating. and I am ruining my realtiosnhips with my partner because I struggle to do day to day tasks. I get so incredibly angry every day. I will go from really happy to angry in about a minute. my mood swings are terrible and some days I really struggle just walking. which is terrible and I realise I really need help for that but also I have no one to talk to about it all. and I wish I just had a friend to talk to about this all but also I feel like they would think I am attention seeking.
 
I just don't know how to feal with it and I wish I did because it is ruining everything around me and I want to be happy again.
 
I don't understand why my partner doesn't car either. I think he thinks I am going through a stage but im not I feel as though I really am depressed and it makes me a terrible person to be around.

I just did TMS for a pretty bad depression, only done one side so far but was told to wait 2 weeks for the brain to have a rest and then onto
left side. The mood and irritability which can very often turn to anger is quite the task to manage gonna see doctor to see if anything can be done whilst i wait to do more tms and dealing with family members has been interesting of late hah. I'm just neeeding to some words of encouragement, prayers also welcome hah whatever you have. I'm both amazed ive dealt with this problem for so many years and just what the power of our brain chemistry when things are disrupted. Anyway cheers

Hi Everyone
When I was a t school I was an ok student. I did ok in math. I struggled with English and science but was ok in Geography and Economics. My biggest problem was that I was a slow writer, so didn't always complete exams. I did not get into University, I went straight into the workforce. I did ok. I was a good worker. I like to think I still am.
I also struggled at school because bullying affected my confidence and made me anxious, so wasn't able to concentrate.
There was a guy, who I thought was a friend, but was forever teasing me. He used to embarass me in front of others. He was one of those people who couldn't say anything nice and he was not happy until he was winding someone up. He did it all the time for no reason and I just hated it. My problem was I was too scared to stand up to him  because I lacked confidence to stand up for myself.
Nowadays I see his name in a a few publications and occasionally drive past his office and he has become very successful. I don't mean to be jealous, but it just irks me because he has probably got successful by be mean, pushy and nasty.
Myself, on the other hand, will never be able to be a manager. I have just always struggled to have authority. Even my children don't do as I ask them. It makes me feel so sad.

Hi all,
I have spent a heap of time looking at definitions of workplace bullying but my insistence on giving people the benefit of the doubt means I just don’t know. I do know it is destroying my mental health so it ticks that box.
Before I go any further I have no intention of making an official complaint I only hope to use it to get approval from my boss to apply for other jobs internally (hr requirement and she said no to me last year.)
Another team leader has for a while now taken to coming down laughing really loudly to tell my team leader about every little mistake I make. Her newest response to him when he appears laughing is oh, what now. I hear this and I do not even sit next to her and I have music playing in my headphones all day, every day (I just upgraded to expensive noise cancelling ones so now all I hear is the laughter and I don’t hear the negative chat anymore) so you can imagine what everyone else who sits closer actually hears (a co-worker who had made remarks about having no idea how I work listening to music even started wearing earphones - she sits much closer to her.) 
For the record my workplace has a quality target of 95%. I have never dropped below this (mostly 98-100% every week) even though I am the newest person in the team. Actually when I look at the little tracker thing that tracks our every second of the day, my quality is often the best in the team (multiple people below 95% despite some having 10+ years experience) at worst it may drop to the second best in the team. 😱😳🤭 Yes even when I learn something brand new my quality stays consistent - speed drops off, but quality stays. 
I unfortunately help his team a lot (all day every day at the moment) and it appears he has his staff reporting to him with every mistake I make (not even one a day) - he would not know about them otherwise. The work I am helping his team with I only got trained in in December last year - the training has proved horrible where some things I just was not trained on at all (and questions seem hugely discouraged here) and other things it appears I was told one thing as fact but I should have been told multiple other things as well. I have recently told this to my team leader where she made some kind of remark about how that is a hard situation to be in.
At no stage am I actually told about the errors so I just get to keep on making them, while he gets to keep on laughing and making fun of my so far away from actually bad work.
Bullying or not?

Hi, I'm new here because I can’t continue  lying to myself about how depression and anxiety are really affecting my life. I’ll say things like “I’m an introvert, so I don’t really like socialising because I actually enjoy my own company” or “I’m very independent, so I need my own space and freedom” but the honest truth is, I’m afraid of being vulnerable and getting hurt, so I push everyone away first - family, friends, colleagues and partners.  
I’m no different to anyone else, I have shame, guilt, insecurities, trust issues, trauma, confidence issues, anger etc. but these things drive me to isolate myself excessively (in more ways than one). 
My greatest desire and greatest fear are the same thing; letting people see the real me (as I truly am). The side of me that the world sees, is the version I’ve created, so that the real me can stay hidden (safe from harm) but I’m honestly so lonely - it was a struggle to even write “I’m lonely” because until now, I’d lied to myself so much, that I convinced myself that I’m 100% content (and or happy) with being alone (even for the rest of my life). 
I want to challenge the lies and beliefs that are holding me back (no longer serving me) and this post is the first (honest) step in the right direction.

Hi, Im new on here, & actually feel really strange posting about something so personal.
I wanted to talk about how as someone who has battled depression since I was a young adult, the pressure to be ""normal"" from family, & how they cannot see it as a ""real"" illness, they say things like : its all in your head, just get on with it, don't be so negative etc. I also find myself to be my biggest judge too, its not a ""physical"" condition, so what gives me the right to usurp those with ""real"" problems. ( My parents were in the war & a concentration camp so therefore they experienced real hardship & in this era of wealth cannot see how anyone can be depressed)
And wanting to push myself to get moving, go on do something you lazy woman goes the inner chatter (or worse) & feeling worse. 
Your thoughts are appreciated.

Hey everyone, 
 
I just wanted some input on my thoughts on the topics of mental health. First i'd like to say- its probably a little ironic that I'm asking for objective answers when this is a support network, but anyway.
 
Is it really depression that a lot of us are feeling? Being intellectually impaired, having no talent, no friends or even good relationships with family. I mean, i'm not in denial that depression exist, and from my understanding, they are chemical/hormonal imbalances in the brain making you predisposed to be more likely sad. Regardless, I don't believe an absence of being predisposed to being sad will make you not sad if you're life has no reason for happiness. 
 
Is it really being negative, or being realistic? I've heard almost everyone say, or at least imply ''you can't be bad at everything; you've got to be good at something. there is a place in the world for everyone!''. I can't even argue with this, logic is completely thrown out of the window. People want to believe in world of equity, believing that everyone has a place in the world, but is that really true? Do starving children in developing countries have a place in this world?And, as these injustices exists in other places of the world, why does it seem that they can't exist in developed societies? It's almost like- because of the fact you're living in a developed country, you're expected to be intelligent, good at things and meet standards and social expectations. 
 
Sorry everyone, I don't intend to sound mean or bad or anything like that. I'm just really tired of people being illogical and evasive. I'm the type of person who'd rather acknowledge my problems first, then see what I can do from there as appose to deny them as problems. Furthermore, I hope someone responds to this. Thanks everyone for at least reading to this point :)

Depression has made me an incredibly dull person. I don't really have hobbies or interests, because nothing interests me anymore. I never know what to say in a conversation; I just make it bad and awkward. I never really contact people for fear of being a burden or annoyance in their lives. 
So why do people make the effort to text/call me? I legitimately do not understand?

It has been a nice day, so I decided to get out of the house, go for a drive and then on the way back, stopped at the local shops to see if either coles or woolies had caramilk, coz seriously, who doesn't love chocolate? Anyway, was literally in and out within half an hour and now I've spent 2 hours looking for my stupid car and I ended up calling my parents coz I was so stressed out. All dad could do was laugh at me while I was telling him. He's on the way to the shops now, but I feel so dumb.

Hi, I'm new to this website, to this feeling, to this country...Came here almost 2 years ago full of motivation, thinking of a future, abandoning my career as a psychologist back home to pursue the dream my dad was trying to achieve before passing away, looking always forward. It turns out I've been almost 2 years doing nothing, in a job I never thought I'd be doing, alone, without friends, not even a relationship, soemthing which I've always been into since I'm a huge fan of loving, regardless the its implicit suffering. I've recently experienced something which opened an old wound. 10 years ago, Being humiliated (over trivial relationship issues) by the person I loved triggered a really particular anxiety in me...I've found so hard to have satisfactory sexual relationships, in cases I just...can't...oh gosh...this is so painful, stressful...depressive, humiliating ....not only I cope with anxiety but now the depression of thinking how I'm coming out of this....I wish I could meet someone special, but I feel I can't, I'm already shy + a sexual disorder or whatever it's called triggered by anxiety + seeing my dreams of meeting someone special or having a family destroyed....I can't even go to a party and behave as a regular 29yo guy because I'm even scared of meeting someone and have a one night stand....How did I get to this? how do I become what I used to be? 
I used to brag about being a tough guy, sensitive and empathetic to others, but strong wth my own emotions, now I'm broken to pieces, some may well say that's not that relevant but....Only guys can understand how important is that virility or manhood thing for us...I came here to honour my dad's memory, his dream of living somewhere else, I came here as a professional to keep studying and look for a future here...all I've found is loneliness and suffering.
oh my, apart from studying, love is my passion and I've been deprived from it...I dont see a way out..I had never told this to anyone and is so embarassing and ...

Hi all,
Im 15 years old, sounds too young to be dealing with serious problems right? welp. I dunno. I have been diagnosed depression since about July 2018 and i was prescribed 20mg of Lovan. This was after I got into smoking pot at 14/15. I never really smoked that much and it was never a major problem but thats a point where i can say it started to go downhill a little faster than it had been for the 3/4 years prior to that. (even though i was so young i was always secretly upset, on the outside i was funn, crazy silly, crude and kind all at the same time. Anyway, i stopped smoking after being prescribed medication. In about april of 2019 i smoked for the first time in about 12 months. This didnt really affect me; i was still taking my medication but i really enjoyed myself. fast forward a month from then and my medication's dosage is increased. This seems to help for a bit. But i was having anxiety attacks everyday. Until about 4 weeks ago. I smoked marijuana again. Great time, however the next day was dreadful. It was an important day and i barely got through it. I smoked again a week later (this is during school holidays). Once again, no problem. skip two more weeks, my feelings are plummeting. Was this because of the pot? I cant say i know. God there is so much more i want to type. ok im getting off track but i feel i just need to get this all down: My two closest mates have also been dealing with depression since the start of 2019. Except the difference between them and me was that they were smoking pot every night for about 4 months. They never wanted to try and get me on it but it was sad seeing them deteriorate every day. Theyre situations are so much worse than mine. One's dad is dead, his oldest brother is a psycopath who ruined his family's lives before he grew up, his other oldest brother is a big time drug dealer (providing him with easy drugs).  I just longed the feeling of numbness. i want to smoke so badly, i want to do all these drugs so badly because i dont see a future for myself. I have a dream but no motivation to follow it. there is so much more about me contributing to my total disatisfaction with life right now but 2500 characters can only explain so much.
Thanks

Hello, I am brand new to beyond blue forums. I am a high school student and I have recently being diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I am to start going to a psychiatrist but the waiting line is so long that I wouldn't begin my sessions until January. I have tried psychologists and therapists but they haven't worked. I sometimes urgently need to talk to someone because I feel as if i'm about to break down and just melt into the floor. It's hard because through out the day I am sometimes ok and I laugh with my friends but as soon as I get home there is this thick layer of loneliness that just spreads over me and I feel as though I have no one. I have an amazing single mum as my father left when I was very young and incredible friends but not even they can stop me from feeling so intensely alone. I just wanted to share a bit of my mental health story as this is a place of people that can hopefully understand and relate to what I am going through so I don't feel entirely insane

And i drive myself crazy thinking everythings about me, i drive myself crazy cause i cant escape the gravity. Im holding on why is everything so heavy, so much more than i can carry. I keep dragging around whats bringing me down if i just let go ill be set free. People think that im paranoid but im pretty sure the world is out to get me. Its not like i make the choice to let my mind stay so 😕😕##😕#😕 messy. Why is everything so heavy

I've recently hit rock bottom. It was a scary experience, as I'm sure most of you know when reaching that point.

I still haven't been to see someone yet, like my GP or a psychologist, as I'm still trying to work out what's best for me, in terms of treatment options, so I've been doing a lot of self reflection, which has been great and really therapeutic.

Anyway, one of the issues that seems to keep coming up is people are like ""hey, you're my friend, i care about you blah blah blah"" or ""hey, i need help with something, are you free?"" It's like they're telling you what you want to hear for that moment, but in reality they don't really they don't? Almost like they think a quick catchup for coffee will do, but then don't make the effort to Check in with a message, even though you've already opened up about everything, so they should know, they say they know and understand, they've been through it themselves, but don't Check in to see how you are. Or when people ask me for help with something, it's only because they know I'll drop things to go and help that person for whatever reason, because they claim I'm a friend and I consider them a friend, but in all honesty they're only really using you for their own personal gain?

I've had a recent crash back into major depression. I have been prescribed SNRIs. It helps when I feel 'bloody' aka cranky and irritated, but not enough to keep me from eating constantly. I have gained 10kg in a month.
The compulsion to eat is so strong when I am at home, so I have been trying to get out of the house as much as I can. The trouble is, when I go out, I get cranky.
It's a real problem. I'm running out of clothes that fit, my food bill has gone through the roof and my body is screaming.
It's not like a binge, it's an overwhelming compulsion. I have told my psychologist and my Mental Health Nurse, but they don't seem to get it.
What can I do?

When were you last truly happy? 
I came across this question while doing some self-research on a couple of therapy techniques, and it stumped me. When was I last truly happy? I'm not just talking about when did you last feel joy, do something fun, laughed, or had a smile on your face. When were you last TRULY happy? It may just be a manifestation of this crippling disease, but I truly don't remember. So, I thought I'd throw the question out to YOU - when were YOU last truly happy?

Hello.
I'm a 28 year old female who doesn't have any motivation or joy in anything I do, not even the things I love to do. I have a hard time convincing myself that I'm important enough to care about myself, but I don't.
Everyday I wake up without eating breakfast and do the bare minimum of my morning routine before heading to work. Its so that I look normal enough to people so they don't assume I'm really broken inside. Everyone at work knows me as the Smiley, someone who is happy and friendly all the time, a ball of sunshine.
The truth is I only smile to trick my brain into thinking that Im actually happy but I'm not. Each night I wonder if I could pass away in my sleep because I think maybe it would be the only way I feel happy. Is there something wrong with me that I feel happiness is some kind of short-lived illusion?
I suppose I have some underlying issues to address, but I don't even know what they are.
I really don't have many friends because its hard for me to relate to anyone. It feels lonely despite not being alone around people.
I hope I can find some understandings as to why I feel this way, and why others like me feel the way they do.

Hello everyone,
I just want to express my slight
depression that I am facing with my partner. My partner is a lovely and kind
person that makes me happy and laugh most of the time. He does thing silly just
to make me smile. He have been through a lot from his pass and he want to help
people that he knows not to be down. 
We are from different background
and beliefs. But the problem is not that. He has been texting two friends
(women). I am glad that he confessed that he was doing it and they have been
his friends for a long time. They have problems with relationship, and he tries
to lift them up by saying beautiful thigs just to lift their spirit up. Basically
my partner tells me everything which I am happy and honour that he does. The
problem is ME. Because I am from a different country and different
background where I find it hard for a person that I love texting another person
for a good cause. I know I should not feel upset or depress but sometimes I do
feel sad and upset where negative thought disturbed me thinking that he is
having an affair or cheating me where he assures me it’s not. I am happy that
he is helping others that have problem with their relationship where he wants
to build their self confidence back and let them think that there are people
out there that are great and can be loved again.
Saying that because of that fear,
I kept asking him question about if he is cheating and what they text and etc even
though I know what’s happening. I also told him that I am too old for dramas
and relationship that involve cheating. 
Additional to that, he told me
numerous times where I kept asking him (probably in a same manner which he
said) the same question over and over again and he hates to repeat them until
we argue. Now we don’t talk too much and I feel lonely even though we stay
together. He even says that I don’t want to learn about his culture where I
always give an excuse and want to follow my way only without compromising and
seeing his point of view which I should in order to sustain the relationship.
I know you all would probably say
the same things as I should trust him, Give it a chance on knowing things, not to
thinks like wise and etc which I am in that state of mind as I have pass that
stage and grew to know what I should or should not do as I don’t feed to my
negative thoughts. I help relating to me as individual.

Hi,
I’m not really sure how this works but I figured I need to talk about it. My problems seem to be a mix of anxiety and depression and I wasn't really sure where to post it but I think here will do.

My problems aren’t as bad as others. But someone said to me the other day, your pain is not diminished by the pain of others. 

I’ve found myself getting really down lately. I’ve had cold symptoms for the past 3 months constantly. I googled it last night and it said it could be stress related.

A few weeks ago I realised that I felt as though if I went to sleep and didn’t wake up, I wouldn’t mind. I told my partner and he didn’t know what to say.

I feel as though my parents don’t care about me. Whenever I’ve challenges in my life, they don’t seem to notice or care. A few years ago, I went to a work dinner. It didn’t go so well because I was getting a bit anxious. I told my mother when I got home and her response was, ‘Well, that’s your own fault.’ I was already hesitant to tell her stuff before that but ever since then even more. I see and hear other parents worrying about their kids and think, ‘Why can’t my parents be like that?’ I didn’t ask for them to be my parents. 

I feel as though I struggle to make friends with people I connect with. A few times I’ve found friendships that I feel guilted into or the other person doesn’t have friends so they desperately try to make me their best buddy.

I’ve been at uni in hopes of getting another job. I’ve studied to be a teacher. I’m currently a relief teacher. The work is either feast or famine and in times of famine I get really anxious about money. On days I don’t get offered work, I struggle not to see it as a personal reflection on myself. I’ve studied at uni for 6 years now and can’t find steady work. 

I feel as though I’m high-functioning because when I’m in a routine and busy, life is good. When things are lullish and my finances aren’t organised and I don’t feel cared for, I get down. 

A few years ago I tried to get into the police force and nearly got there. I’d like to try again. But am worried my current mental health state will let me down. I’m also worried about seeking help because I have to declare it in application if I try again.

I guess I’m looking for advice in all of these areas.

I’m not diagnosed with anything or on any medication.
Hi, for the last few years I’ve suffered only what I can describe as depressive episodes, and other emotional mood swings. There seems to be very little that prompts these, as I can be with friends and enjoying myself one moment and then the next suicidal, I’m aware the whole time that nothing is wrong or should be but I am reduced to near tears.
I rarely act on these impulses, and there’s enough of a period between them where I question if there’s anything actually wrong. Mostly I am also struck by a great deal of lethargy and try to stay asleep as long as I can, and a lot of the things I once enjoyed no longer hold any interest to me. It feels like the luster has gone out of life and I’m only existing out of obligation.
Though, I do not feel I am in any immediate danger to myself, I have made attempts in the past and it is a daily thought or consideration, and I find thoughts such as “kill yourself”, “go die” come unprompted and even to the point I sometimes verbalise them without thinking.
I will be taking steps to see a GP and work on my mental health plan, it's just all a little confusing and I feel lost in it.

So I've told my partner that I have depression from the start of our relationship 2 and half years ago. Although it's been so bad lately I've been crying everyday and not wanting to get out of bed.
Although when I do see him a couple times a week I'm happy and it feels like I'm hiding it all unintentionally. Like I feel my whole world crumbling apart but to him I must look fine. I feel like I need to say something but I don't know how. 

Like hey I'm really depressed! Wooo and then I ball my eyes out and hell just be sad. Like what does that achieve is it better just keeping it as it is? I don't know how to be depressed and not bring people down with me that are around me. 
How should I go about this without being a burden? 

Also for anyone out there doing university how do you deal with uni and depression literally can't cope anymore. I'm in my 3rd year about to graduate yet I can't cope I'm having mental breakdowns and am so depressed. But the idea of stopping just makes me feel like a failure and letting everyone down. Ive made it through the whole semester just have to pass the exams but I just don't even know if I can do that. Help

This is extremely difficult for me to talk about, as it always is when I even try to talk about my depression and anxiety.

I'm 26 year old male who worries about eveything, was in a long relationship about to get married, and she ended it (which was the best thing for both of us, but lonlyness is a hell of a thing), everytime I get close to being a little happier I screw it up for myself,still hung up on my father's deaths when I was 17. . I quit my dream job out of fear of time off due to endless hours of wanting to end it, pretty much every day and I had to put on a face of basic maleness as just pretend shit was good. It got to the point where I just couldn't do it anymore so I left.

I have tried to hold 2 jobs since then but all I seem to do is struggle getting out of bed and have to try and get through it. I'm on my third job now which I actually enjoy, everyone is nice and I enjoy the work. But I have had  time off and I'm so early into the job again. I'm back on my medication on a high dose which has messed me up big time. Headaches, feeling worthless, the usual? 

Today I had to take another day off because I had a massive panic attack before I was about to leave and just felt off, feeling numb and just not myself today. I don't know what to do, I'm probabaly going to lose my job in the end I think. 

Honestly it feels ever since everything that's happened, I try and I try but it never gets better, it always just goes back to shit. 

I don't know what to do anymore. If you read this thank you.

Hello
I’m here because I feel extremely lonely and somehow talking to strangers about how I feel is better than trying to tell my friends.
It really feels like no one cares about me. I have friends at work, friends from uni, friends I’ve known since year 7 (known them for 13 years now), and siblings and family and cousins but it honestly feels like not a single person truly understands me, or wants to spend time with me, or actually cares. 
Maybe they’ll ask how my day was, or give me a hug when I’m upset, or go out somewhere with me for fun. But it always feels empty. I feel often that people tune out when I tell them how I am. Or they’ll listen but not seem to care beyond being there in the moment, but after that it’s just like I’m all alone again. 
I’ve always seemed to care more in relationships than the other person, and so it makes me less and less inclined to seek any sort of friendships because I’m tired of the feeling I get when they stop caring or trying to see me. 
I feel unhappy and lonely every single day, every time I hang out with people or work or do uni it’s a welcome distraction, but as soon as that’s over I just feel awful and lonely and empty inside. It feels like I never have any energy, and a lot of the time, thinking about how I could die is such a peaceful, happy, calming thought, it’s the most effective way I’ve found to feel better. Above things I love like music or food or animals or maths or sport, it feels like genuine happiness instead of forced like when I try to do these activities. 
ive already been told time and time again to do new things and join communities but I’ve done this so much, trying to meet new people and constantly being unsuccessful has left me drained and tired of this. 
Really I feel tired in general, and the only motivation I have to keep going each day is societal pressure to keep acting like everything is ok. 
I’m just tired of everything, including these feelings, and ending everything feels like where I will go if it ever gets worse than it is now. 
Well, that’s an essay but I just wanted to be honest.

First time posting and while I think it's still pointless, At least I finally said it, gotten it off my chest.
*Edited* I'm sorry, I know it's meant to be kept short-ish, but this is the first time I have even spoken about this and it just kept going. So please please dont feel like you need to read it! I just needed that outlet.  
I have had server depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember I've learnt to ""handle it"" by numbing it out. Hasnt always worked in my favor tho. 
Ive written this a few times now and just lost on what to write well actually just lost in general. I have to keep telling myself that although I dont feel it I'm lucky and blessed. As I know no matter what, there are people out there worse off then me.
I have gotten to the stage that I have buried every crappy thing that was thrown my way. Where I've convinced myself that it was just a book that I had read. I dont even know if that makes sense. 
I've haven't been dealt the best hand when it comes to life.  From the time I was 10  I was on my own. Slept on the streets, stuck with people that only dealt with me because they got paid. Never had anything that was just mine,  Lost everything over and over again.(I Was placed in the foster system) obviously a lot to that story. But I've never been able to forgive my mum and dad for abandoning me, and putting me in that situation. while my siblings had the life that people would dream of.
And it just kept going downhill from there, finally moved back here at 18. Where I met my ex, Feel pregnant. Ended up homeless again. Lost my child to his mother. The list goes on. 
The last few years Ive worked extremely hard and im finally in the best situation in my life. I have a loving partner, I have my 3 beautiful boys who I adore, who have made me a better person, we have a roof over our head, and food on the table. 
But I cant help but feel the lowest I have ever been. I dont even know who Iam anymore. Everything I once used to love to do has disappeared, I feel like I'm losing my mind. Like im going bat shit crazy. I'm over being all over the shop, over constantly being anxious, sad, angry,  and emotional and just straight out numb. 
Surely theres more to the world then this, more than just emptiness.  
 
I have to hope....

I feel like a completely different person when im with my friends. I don't get to see them often as we all work different schedules, but on that rare occaision it's great. I feel genuinly happy with them, I can laugh and smile with them without feeling any stress. I love them. 

However as soon as they're gone I hit the wall again, every single time. It's like as soon as i close the car door after saying goodbye i go numb and weak. Does anyone else experience this? Or any advice to combat this? I haven't brought it up to my doctor or psychologist, but I plan on it next time I see them. Thank you.

Hi guys,

Not sure where to start.. I'm a 27 year old male, however I feel so lost in life, I find 0 enjoyment in any activities, everything feels like a chore that I need to build up effort to do. My brain is constantly thinking 24/7 about all of lifes stress. Since a young age I've always been a constant worrier, felt like I used to have to walk on eggshells in my house to keep the peace between my brothers & my father (They never got a long) 

The early years of my twenties were not too bad, I did suffer a few panic attacks and had anxiety, however I did enjoy life and what it had to offer, now it seems the older I get, the less I enjoy things, I don't see the point in anything.

One of the emotions I do feel is loneliness, I have family that care about me, but my friends are moving on with their life and I'm still yet to find anyone that will give me a chance, I have low self esteem that stems from bullying when I was younger, so I find it hard to trust people when they compliment me.

I've been on medication in the past for my anxiety, however I am strongly considering getting back on it as each day is so bleak I feel like crying and giving up. 

I have this constant fear in the back of my mind that I'll be alone forever, I'll be an old man with no family or friends or anyone, and I'll die alone, and it scares the shit out of me. 

Does anyone else feel like this, or have any advice? I work full time, I come home and I smoke cannabis as it seems to be the thing that relaxes me, but now I'm not sure if this is adding to making me worse?

I'm just so confused and lost :(

Hi everyone, I am currently experiencing huge relationship issues with my boyfriend. Both of us tried to broke up with each other many times due to unsolvable family issue in the past couple months but all failed. We used to have so many beautiful memories/times together. I could still remember the time we were holding our hands and keeps kissing each other everywhere we go. However after so many on and off in this
relationship, I can no longer feel any joy and happiness between us, however every break up makes me extremally painful, there are many times I want to finish my life, but I still don't have enough nerve to do so. Now, I found myself extremely depressed and feeling
very uncomfortable both mentally & physically. I do not want to share all of this with my friends and family because I don't want people to worry and don't wanna answer any follow-up questions.

Hello this is my first post. I have visited + read threads on and off over the years this is my first time back in a long time. I have noticed a change in Beyond Blue for the better and have made use of some of those improvements so good on all who are involved. I am 60 years old and my life has evaporated without me noticing. I am so angry upset disappointed in myself and a system that allows people like me to slip through the cracks. I am a functioning depressive functioning enough to work when I can to earn just enough to live.i feel tired, anxious, apathetic at other times and just about gave up on finding help. Having to repeat a selection of problems a lifetimes worth in 1 hour to a new shrink or psychologist who is often overworked or actually just bored to death by other people’s problems often just make you feel worse. It’s not OK being a depressive, I am not OK and no amount of govt funding is going to make that campaign any more than a feel good except size. Oops I digress. I don’t want Dysthymia, Existential Depression (I think therefore I am depressed) to ruled what time I have left. I have so little hope or energy left, no money for expensive help and find 8 sessions a year with a shrink or psych ( if you can find one) very unsatisfactory ( useless) also SA seems to have limited resources if you don’t fit into the right category. White, post menopausal, slowly dying.

Hey i’ll try Keep this short, Im a 23 year old male play a lot of sport, have a big social life and in general have a pretty good life, I started suffering anxiety 5-6 years ago (triggered from an ecstasy pill, lots of ups and downs but eventually improved heaps over the last 2 years through learning how to manage it, basically my life was good again, 
I’ve recently relapsed but into a way more depressive state, I’m struggling more then ever before and with my gp I’ve decided to start medication, it seems like my last hope. Any way I thought I’d write down some of my feelings and worries to see if anyone out there had some advice on how to go about this and yeh any tips or even anyone who can relate to me, thanks 
feelings-


Like there is a constant dark cloud over my head, Sometimes i can break out of it when I’m keeping busy or with friends but not a lot 

-Things become overwhelming, just everything around me freaks me out

-It can feel like I’m in some sort of dream state, maybe like a derealization
-Things just become less enjoyable, I’m not concerned with the fun things I once was eg (girls and sports and hanging out with mates)
-I feel confused 
-Sometimes it just feels like I’m going crazy, like I’m about to breakdown and just lose my mind
-Sometimes can just feel empty and emotionless 
-It can sometimes feel like I’m dying almost, just like nothing matters anymore and like the old (happy/normal) me is gone, that life is over, something like that it’s hard to describe that feeling 
-I can feel like I’m I stuck in some sort of drug trip, just like a big loop 
-Lots of flashbacks of previous good and bad times

thoughts/worries-


-I keep worrying that I’m stuck like this and it won’t get better
-I worry that I won’t be able to handle this anymore and will get to the point that I’m suicidal 
-I worry that this isn’t just anxiety and depression and that possibly something else is causing it and that I’m not getting treated properly
-I worry medication might loop me out and send me crazy 
-I’m concerned and stressing about my mental health nearly 100% of the day rather then filling my mind with thoughts on other normal day to day stuff
-Sometimes I’m able to think about other normal stuff but it always comes back

Hi i was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and high anxiety 15 years ago and have been struggling ever since.  2 weeks ago a psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar.  
I'm feeling very confused and don't know what to make of this.  I've researched a lot on bipolar on line and keep going back and forth in my mind  on whether I agree with her diagnosis or not.
I was hoping I might be able to reach out to others here that might relate and help me understand what this diagnosis means.  I guess I'm just feeling a bit lost and looking for guidance.  Hope that's ok.

Hey
I'm a 42 yr old single mother of 4. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for around 20 years. This is my first time here. 
I am really struggling atm, lve had a lot going on for a number of years, especially recently. This is the worst l have ever been and l just can't seem to get myself out of it. I have some good days but mostly bad where l don't want to get out of bed let alone leave the house. I feel like lm a terrible mother coz l don't want to cook or clean or doing anything really. I'm so exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally. I don't sleep very well due to just thinking about everything from past & present. There r so many things that lve done, experienced and been through that l haven't dealt with. I find it hard to talk to my friends or family as l don't want to burden them with my problems as they have their own. 
I was recently terminated from my job that l loved which l feel was unfair as l had been off work due to my mental health being so bad caused from my manager of 4 years that is very narcissist and manipulative. None of the issues were addressed when l was terminated, only a conversation l had with another staff member who l thought l could trust that caused my termination. Since then l have developed social anxiety, have had my first panic attack and suicidal thought which was terrifying for me. I didn't attempt, and only wanted to stop the pain, not end my life.  Today is one of my really bad days where l lock myself in my room n stay in bed crying. 
I have been on medication for a few years which was doubled when l lost my job. Waiting to see a councillor. My Dr won't give me something to help me sleep which really mad me angry as it's literally driving me crazy at night it being able to sleep.
I just feel so lost, worthless, useless and alone atm. In the past l have been able to pull myself out of it but not this time. I know exactly what l need to do as l have supported many people going through similar (my kids, friends and clients at work) 
My 22 yr old daughter is expecting her first child/my first grandchild in about 4 weeks which is giving me something to really look forward to. She also suffers with her mental health and in the past has self harmed and attempted suicide. So has my 23 yr old son.
I think l must have been a really terrible person in a past life with everything that lve been through and still going through......It's just not fair 😥😥😥

I should be happy .... 3 beautiful healthy happy children. One easy going hard working husband. Financially we are not great but surviving. Kids are almost always smiling hubby always says I love you ,food on the table and roof over our head . 
   However I’m dying on the inside . I miss my extended family who live in another another state , I hate my 2 part time jobs which pay well so leaving them is not really an option. My mil has cancer and going through chemo and we are too far and have our commitments to be constantly there for support. Above everything I’ve had chronic carpal tunnel and knee pain and I know I’m addicted to my pain medication. 
I roll my eyes at myself typical first world problems I think so I smile and carry on . The outside doesn’t match how I feel though . My internal dialogue screams how awful I feel , how desperately I have become addicted to my meds and how I feel my life is spiralling out of control. 
I have ptsd from childhood trauma and take anxiety meds . 
Is there anyone else like me out there?? How do you deal with this . I do see a psychologist but can’t really afford her all the time . 

Thanks

I’m struggling a lot. My boyfriend and I ended out three year relationship (amicably) on Sunday. We just weren’t the one for each other. Regardless he was my best friend and the one I always sought support and comfort from. I left at 9pm Sunday night. 
9am Monday morning, 12 hours later, I took my precious 10 year old cat to the vet for a check up. I only recused her two months prior but she was a shining life changing beacon and lit up my whole life. 10 minutes into the appointment the vet told me she had aggressive cancer, was in significant pain and suffering, and there was nothing to be done for her. It was completely unexpected. I held her in my arms while she took her last breath and let her go that morning. 
I knew my boyfriend and I would break up that weekend. We had both planned it and wanted to spend quality time together to just enjoy the good parts before we went out separate ways. I had no idea my little cat was unwell and I would have to end her life that morning. It was 12 hours only after breaking up. It hurts because if it has been 12 hours earlier my best friend would have been there with me and comforted me and supported me through the grief. But we broke up so he’s not. I told him what had happened and he was sorry but didn’t want to be involved or change things. 
Im struggling ALOT to just function. Eating, drinking, using the toilet, sleeping, socialising, thinking. Life just seems completely and utterly impossible. 
I don’t have a lot of friends and don’t have family aside from my mum, who lives interstate. She’s helping as just as she can but I’m just so lost and feel alone in this grief. I don’t even know what I’m supposed to be grieving, my beautiful cat who was my family, or the loss of my relationship. 
I don’t really know what to expect here. Am i overreacting and being too dramatic?

I think I’m numb. I don’t even know. I used to be really depressed and I’m not sure if this is just a different form of depression or I’m no longer depressed and I just don’t know. I don’t even think I want to get better. I’m comfortable being depressed. I just need someone to tell me what it feels like to be happy or mentally healthy because I could be there. I just have some questions so could someone please reply? Also I’m 16 and started feeling depressed when I was like 13 and got diagnosed and everything but that was a while ago.

I have been with a company for almost ten years. Over the last 2 years I just feel like that are doing their best to get rid of me. They have even gone as far as making up lies and aligations against me. I was stood down for this but have proved them wrong. I am now off on stress leave and don't want to go back because it's not going to stop. My other concern is if I leave now I will loose my long service leave. I have asked every one I can think of about this but nobody can give me an answer. So do I go back for 2 months to complete my 10 years knowing they will try find something to get me fired or do I walk away now and loose my long service leave. Knowing this makes me even more stressed and anxious and worried which is not good. Any help would be great, thanks.

Working 6 days a week on a project in this part of the world i am finding myself feeling so along and missing my 3 year old boy and wife to the point i break down and cry most nights when im alone. I usually try to stay up till 11pm here to catch them in their morning routine.and for those 5.5 hours after work i usually walk somewhere with some work colleges grab a bite to eat and return to the hotel. i try to work out a bit to help pass tim and release some natural endorphins... 

Nothing is working currently... i have only been here 5 days and have another 33 to go.. i have little to no support, and really need some help to cope

I've been dealing with GAD and health anxiety for about 12 years, (I'm a 21 year old male). As a 9 year old, I would make my parents take me to the doctor at least once a week to confirm that I didn't have meningococcal, and throughout my teen years I was convinced that I had three different types of cancer, HIV, and Lyme disease. I generally do a good job of seeking help, I see a psychologist once a fortnight and I regularly talk to my family about my mental health. I am more anxious than depressed most of the time.
I've had periods of depression throughout my life, but I would never say that I've experienced it to the extent that other people have. I'm wondering if depression is what I'm experiencing now, and hoping that someone on here can reassure me that what I'm feeling is a normal part of depression.
I usually have a pretty easy time describing how I feel, and discussing my feelings with people. However, lately, I don't feel as able to do this. I feel this overwhelming sense of numbness, lack of interest in people and things that I usually care about, and a sense of impending doom. I feel like sleeping all day, I don't want to be around anybody and don't feel like things will ever get better.
I don't feel like I am able to articulate how I feel to people, there are no really strong emotions, it just feels like an internal pit of emptiness. I don't know how to describe it any better than that. I wonder if this is depression, I feel a little bit sad, but more than anything I just feel hopeless/helpless, like I don't care about anything anymore, and that my quality of life will never improve. 
Has anyone ever experienced this, do you think it is depression? If so, do you have any tips on feeling better? Any responses are valued, I just don't really have anyone that can relate to me in terms of dealing with depression and anxiety, so I thought I would try to get some responses on this forum.
Thank you, and to anyone reading this that feels similar or has experienced anxiety, I hope you feel better soon and know that you have a friend in me.

I seriously can't tell anymore. 
I have this constant emptiness(maybe vulnerbility) and anxious feeling gnawing at me. It might alleviate some time, but it will grow back.
I don't dare to go to sleep unless I'm tired enough to fall asleep in a manner of seconds, or go quiet and do any quality works even if I really want to. 
I had to always watching something or forcing my mind both not to think and not to stop at the same time (Like watching TV), or the darkness and emptiness will find its way and seep in, making me feel anxious, scared, cold and meaningless.
The smallest thing can set me off, and I'm constantly sensing and worrying about things that can go wrong, feeling I'm not prepared for such accidents or mishaps, no matter how slim the chances are. In fact I can't tell whether the chances are small or not, after all there is something called Murphy's Law. And this renders all my efforts, as everything, as long as it can go wrong, will go wrong. How can anyone make anything absolutely perfect?
So it's always there, this gnawing voice, this very deep level of emptiness, powerless, and this angst, I can't even know the reason because anything can lead to that. In this case living alone is burdensome, for the future to me is not something to be looking forward to but something to be feared.
I tried to talk to the family, none of them understand what I was saying, for they don't have the same problem. So all they can say is stop worrying, or you are worry about nothing.
Does anyone here know about this kind of situation? Please share if there is a cure for that.

Hi Everyone,
Here are some ideas you might like to try for managing symptoms of depression. Of course everyone's different, so let us know what works for you, and please feel free to add to the list...
Mindfulness – through breathing or engaging the 5 senses
Distress Tolerance – Accepting Emotions and Self Soothing
Distraction – Put the thoughts/feelings aside and come back to them when you are ready to deal with them
Positive Affirmations – Have some affirmations written down repeat them to yourself daily
Sleep/Exercise/Diet – All 3 aspects of our lifestyle can impact the way we think/feel
Increasing Pleasurable Activities – Engage in at least one pleasurable activity per day

I am a really terrible person
I've been hiding it because otherwise if I don't no one would like me and I would feel lonely
I was pretending that I love everyone and I understand everything
But I am a very pessimistic person who would never agree with anyone
I don't like myself being this way but I'm just too tired to change it
I don't know why the chat is unavailable when it's 11pm maybe they blocked me

So I've been thinking for a little bit that I might have depression, but I was unsure, so I didn't say anything to anyone. Now, people around me have noticed things about me that I see as well. So here is a list (kind of matched up with a symptom list):
- I lack motivation for just about anything, except for the things that make me happy
- I create roadblocks for a majority of tasks and opportunities
- I go through different emotions throughout the day (e.g. I'm not sad for all the day)
- Rumination (can be about literally anything, often ends in a feeling of worthlessness)
- Am quite tired or worn out (could just be school as I am in year 12)
I also did an online test which stated that I fell into the category of moderate depression, but I know that they are only a guide.
What do you guys think? It's really playing on my mind and I need to do something about it

Hi,
I’m posting here because I don’t know where else to turn. I love my partner very much. My partner was diagnosed with bipolar and although there have been many ups and downs, my partner’s current depression has me so worried than ever. She’s locked up in her room and won’t allow me to talk to her in any way. She sometimes gets violent when I try. My phone  has been blocked so there’s no way to contact her when she’s not home. Our child is being so strong but is very sad because my partner won’t even acknowledge her unless she’s yelling at her to get out of the room. 
I want her to know that I’m there for her and I’m so desperate to help but I’m so lost and afraid she’ll hurt herself. 
I’m afraid if I ask friends to check in on her it’ll get worse. Is it in any way inappropriate to ask her psychologist to check in on her?
 Any advice would be appreciated
Thank you

Hi,
I would really appreciate it if someone could help me. 
I can't get out of my own mind. I have depression. Its getting to a point where it feels like it will never ease up. Life has thrown a massive curve ball once again. My mum has been diagnosed with stage 4 non smokers lung cancer and bone cancer. Im to young to lose my mum. I cant get past the thought that she will never see me get married, have children or even see me go through life. I never really got to spend quality time with her as we have all been working non stop. And now the quality time i have with her is because shes sick and needs 24/7 care. Theres so many other factors as to why i have decided to reach out to someone, anyone for help. I just feel so alone and not my happy bright self. I would do anything to go back to being happy. Even for a day. 
I would appreciate if anyone could help me or even reach out and say tat they feel the same so its not so lonely. 
Thanks

I’m feeling a little lost. My mum had oesophagus cancer and went through radiation, chemo and then an operation that she came through with flying colours. Started to get up walk around and eat like normal and then it took a sudden turn, and passed away 13 days after surgery. My brother passed away 11 months and 3 weeks before that from a heart attack and my dad 9 months prior to that from pancreatic cancer. All I do is cry and I don’t know how much longer I can try and hold it all together. I’m the oldest of 3 girls left and I’m trying to hold it together for the other 2  but I don’t know how much longer I can. I’m emotionally and mentally exhausted and don’t know where I go from here.

Hello,
This was a topic I wasn't originally going to bring up but since I have noticed a couple of other people have mentioned having similar feelings and thoughts, I thought I'd brave mentioning my experiences.
I am an athiest however I was raised a Catholic and was also exposed to a lot of mythology and folklore. It was/is believed that some members of my kin see ghosts and have premonitions, myself included. I have always had a curious mind which lead to me seeking answers wanting to know how to become more intune with these gifts. I read and then I read some more and what I discovered broke my heart. For some reason or another I believed science and magic were the same thing which is probably fortunate really because I searched for answers in the non-fiction section and I found them. They just weren't what I wanted. I did not find how to strenghthen my gifts. I did not find how to get back to the world of Faye instead, I found reality. It was a shock to say the least and I spent a good decade or two coming to terms with my discovery and the loss of an entire world. I also commited the most unforgivable crime against God next to being Athiest. Which since then has left me with a feeling of being trapped in Pergatory as punisment and what better way to punish me then to force me to live the life I wished so, very much to escape.
I feel trapped here in reality and have a constant longing to return to my world. I feel like when I see things or have very vivid dreams that they are my real kin trying to get me back, take me home. I know this is not the case but sometimes I still google to try and find away home, just incase. Part of me wants to forget, to live my life but the other part of me is afraid to because then the demons that put me here will have won or is it by holding on that I have failed the angels that put me here to protect me from the Faye?.
I don't actually want anyone to answer that question as I know it is not real. I just can't shake the feeling is all. I have written this to let others know they are not alone in feeling that they do not belong to this world.
What you think does not define who you are, what you do does.

I had anxiety for 2 years silently struggling to breathe every single day. I was so scared to reach out for whatever reason. I was so scared to admit it to myself. I finally accepted it and reached out for help and I feel I was on track to recovery. However, last year I stopped talking to my abusive mother. Even though I know it's for the best it plunged me into a dark place. A place I have now been trying to escape for over a year. I feel so stupid, because I feel like I have done it again. All over again I have been scared to reach out. I have been scared to admit it to myself. I am in a depression. I can't be alone with my thoughts. I can't sleep. I miss my life but can't seem to get back to it. I did go to my GP to talk about medication, but I just cried the whole time. And answered the questions on my mental health test dishonestly because Im scared to be diagnosed. I don't know how severe it is, and how much of this is normal. I don't know what to do to get better. I tried to see my psychologist again, but found out he has left the clinic. I cried a lot and it just feels too overwhelming to organise a new psych. I feel it might be time for me to take some medication, but I'm honestly so afraid of gaining weight. I feel like it's so stupid and I know mental health is just as important but I'm already thicker than I'd like to be. 

I just don't know how to deal with this. I'm trying so hard but haven't made any progress.

I have just realised this week that I am close to having a complete breakdown and possibly a psychotic episode.  It was triggered by some new work that I have taken and it sent me reeling.  That night I could not sleep at all.  The next 3 days I could not go to work and had physical symptoms.  I eventually got some sleep in the following days. but not much,
I have decided not to do that type of work again for my own mental and physical health.
I have long term major depressive disorder and anxiety.  I am taking my medication.
Does anyone have some suggestions to help with managing the sleep issues?  I need to do some work this week and I can't go on feeling this exhausted.

Hello all.. My names Alex and im 30 years old. This is my first post or attempt to reach out to a mental health community... Ive been suffering from axiety and depression most of my life, ive kicked super big goals in the past with travel, and careers and relatipnships, but only temporary (even if that means a few years). I grew up moving alot, getting abused by my parents, i didnt have alot of people to relate to or spend my time with that wernt toxic. I made it out on my own by 17 and lived with friends, grew my career, went through a few really hard breakups. These relationship came with new friends and people willing to let me into their lives and families. Struggled with mental health and having no one around who understands it for such a long time has made this worse, my friends have always said just pick yourself up and move on to whats next. Ive been able to do that time and time again, but the last few years have spiralled. I no longer care about my career, i cant trust people, i am haunted by my best friend leaving me opposed to offering support. I understand what a normal life is, but it doesnt to me at all. What do you do when you dont have anyone, when your burnt out from the simple act of trying. Work gives me no satisfaction, and the many things that i used to love barely even exist anymore, as are my want for them. I dont seem to recogise the world anymore, i see people walking around happy, families, partners and friends, people supporting each other through their lives. I cant let in anymore, between my family and the people ive loved breaking my heart, along with the stesss of mental health. Its so exhausting, at times its like trying to hold up a sand cliff, its just impossible. Does this go away or is this how my life is, is it worth it? when i dont feel, and its not a short time, its all i know. Literally no one understands how i feel when i talk to them, medications have not made an impacyt, theropy made impovments for a time. All i think about now, is mental health, it saturates my brain, ts far too easy to not want to be here anymore, and its unfair that i cant make the people left in my life understand any of this.

I have depression and anxiety. And I'm finding life really hard at the moment but I feel like I can't talk to any of my friends because I'm so worried they'll just think I'm attention seeking, and everyone already has enough problems of their own anyway.. I feel so guilty for having depression and anxiety because I feel like I don't have an excuse to feel like this because I have a 'good' life, I know so many people have it so much worse than me so yeah I feel like what excuse do I have. I worry so much that I'm just making it all up because for years I thought something was off with how I felt and I tried talking to my parents but they just said I was fine. But finally years later someone convinced me to go see a doctor, who said I have bad depression and anxiety.. (Later my parents said they had figured that but hadn't wanted me to label myself with that.) But that just resulted in me feeling worse because I'm not fine, but I should be fine, but I'm not, but maybe I am, but I don't think I am, BUT I SHOULD BE... and feeling like what if I was making it all up and feeling so guilty. Even now after the doctor has told me I have depression and anxiety, I still feel so guilty and worry I'm making it all up.. So I don't know how to reach out to my friends..

I don’t know what’s going on. I’ve suffered with depression for years I’m one month Into trialling a new medication. 3 days ago I snapped I just woke up hysterical crying. My chest felt like an elephant sitting on it. Every time I hear noise or my phone goes off or someone moves I feel a jolt in my heart and a panic and can’t breathe properly. I was on the verge of harming myself after the first day. I’ve passed that point the hysterical crying has stopped but today three days later I still feel I can’t do anything. My chest hurts my heart hurts my soul hurts I feel like I can’t brwathe and every thing still makes me jump. I’ve never had a episode like this before. How do I make it stop? I went to my gp and broke down and she said I have a viral infection and sent me away she didn’t even listen. I’ve tried talking I’ve talked it alllll out with family and friends but nothing is helping this.

Hi
I have a really good friend in his early 30s who I believe has depression based upon a number of things he tells me and that I observe. I have suggested he speak to someone however he continues to tell me he is fine and does not need to.
Is there more that I could be doing as I do not want to become a pseudo psychologist for him?
Thanks

Hi all, I’m Jack and I am new to the forums.

I have depression, on medication and have managed it as best as I can. I have been honest with my family and partner but I recently realised I have not been honest with myself.

Earlier this week I had a few drinks, went to the strip clubs on my own, watched porn and wrote off Friday; thankfully I did not have to be anywhere. This is something I do every now and then but this time I ended up in a club with a group of people I did not know. I eventually came to, left and come home. My partner does know about what I have done but does not judge me for going but is upset I go by myself. I am looking to shake this habit as I often feel guilty about going afterward, spending money and that I have gone on my own again.

I am looking to change my habit but unsure I where or how to begin. I am looking to go back to professional help but can not afford it at this moment. I would like to mention I do not have anything against those in the adult industry; I am looking for advice on changing my habits.
Thanks in advance for help and support.

i went to a funeral today. i felt out of place because i didn't know anyone. i knew the deceased person a long time ago. i left early. after i got home. i called a friend. he had his own things going on and we didnt connect very well. i cut the call short and fell into a nasty spiral. combination of thinking about the death of this person and all the time that has gone by, and feeling extremely isolated and frightened of the future. a feeling that all the years have just led me to this dark lonely place, and the future only holds worse and worse things. i feel i have failed everything and everyone and that people would prefer it if i just went away. i feel incapable of contributing anything of value at all. even though i know this is rather extreme and not objectively true, it is how i feel.

Hello,
 
Usually, I don't like going online and asking around about these types of things, but it's been on my mind for about a year now.
My dream was to join the Defense force, and now, it's obvious my chances of getting in now are slim. When I was 13-14, I was spinning out and I got myself in a bit of a bad situation. Let's just say I wasn't the happiest guy, and I wasn't doing the best things to my body, and I wasn't really an ally to any other human near me. I hated everyone, and I hated myself. I attempted something I shouldn't have ever done. In the seconds I had to choose between life or death, I finally switched on and realized maybe doing this isn't the best option. But it was too late. I was in a hospital for two weeks and my already stained medical history got even worse. 
So, this leaves me with a problem. I know that the Army can reject me, and for good reason. So where do I go from here? 
I've been thinking about Emergency Services or just a Security guard, but I know both will probably reject me as well, thanks to my medical history. All I want to do is help people, and make my life and other lives better or defend Australia and its people. Well, I better cut to the chase anyway... My question to you adults, is, Is there a future for me if I have a history of clinical depression? I feel as though I'll be locked out of anything I try because I'm ""Mentally Ill"" just because of something stupid I did as a young boy.
I'd love to hear your opinions and thoughts on this.
Thanks.

I'm a student studying, working and running a Freelance Beauty Business. It's not my #1 passion, but I need to make a living. Usually I'm tough with criticism, but this year has been challenging professionally and personally. My business has been okay, but one particular event has really affected me. 4 months ago in May, I was contacted by a woman from Girl Guides who wanted me to do chair massages on 25 women for a Mother's Day event, 2 days beforehand. Initially, I agreed to go, but she insisted I needed to bring a partner. I had been very busy that week, and I was drained and exhausted, but still complied. However, I asked all my classmates (honestly did), and none of them were interested or able to. I told her this, but she still said keep searching. I researched Mobile Massage Business, tried contacting them, but didn't get immediate responses as it was after hours. Additionally, I was also called to work a night shift, which had tipped me over. I informed her I was unfortunately unable to attend anymore. She wrote a long, angry text saying, ""Wow I hope that is not how you plan to run your business after you graduate. It was more than an opportunity with fair pay. How dare you scam and deceive our organisation - a charity that empowers and supports women. You have insulted us, especially all the mums who work hard for their kids, much harder than you do. You are selfish and heartless, all what Girl Guides is NOT about. Now we are left panicking and desperately scrambling to find a replacement in less than 24 hours, or cancel the event and have 25 disappointed mums. Won't be surprised if you get sued.""
I immediately apologised, offered to help and go to the event. Despite this, she replied she had found someone else and it was too late. I didn't respond and deleted her number. Obviously I was very angry and upset, and cried for a week. Even now, I still can't help but feel stupid and selfish, that I'm hearing her words repeating in my head. I've tried my best to combat it, volunteering Oxfam/Church, playing violin and counselling. Yet it's hard to fight through it. It's a one-off event, but especially the fact this woman leads 3 groups and 'actively involved in community' makes me sick. Being a sensitive, anxious introvert, it really hurts. I know I should 'get over it', as my family and friends have told me. I'm trying. But right now, I just needed to get this off. I'm just wanting to seek advice, support, whatever it maybe. Would appreciate it.

So I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression a lot lately and could really use some advice.
ill try keep this as short as I can but I think I’d feel better getting it out there rather than keeping it all trapped in my head.
it started when I was 17/18 (I’m now 23) I had taken an ecstasy pill and had a bad come down and it triggered the anxiety, I struggled through that for a few years, I saw a psychologist and did learn some techniques to help cope but I wouldn’t say it was a massive success, over time it would slowly improve had my ups and downs but started to feel really good eventually, got myself a proper full time job and was barely affected by my anxiety, lived a pretty normal life which was awesome but recently it all started crashing down and it hit me hard, I’ve slumped into a depressive state and I’m not sure what to do, I’m always on edge feeling agitated, when I’m out of the house I just wanna go home, I don’t even want to be around my friends which is completely new for me, it’s like an all day 24 hour thing I just feel down and out like I’m stuck in some bubble, but at the same time mind racing 1 millions miles an hour  I can’t concentrate It hurts my head trying to converse with someone, its hard to explain but I just don’t feel good at all. 
For me my anxiety and depression is about my anxiety and depression if that makes any sense? It’s not about work, fitting In etc. 
thinking about trying some sort of anti depressants because it really does feel like some sort of chemical imbalance but yeh not sure if that’s the right thing to do.
thanks, hope to hear back from someone soon

Hi,
I have had anxiety for as long as I remember so I have become quite used to coping with it, but I was recently also diagnosed with depression too. I honestly have no idea how to cope with depression so when I get to a really bad place I just turn to the people around me to help me. I have found that no matter how well-intended they are, none of these people know what to say and so often respond with something along the lines of 'don't feel that way' or 'stop thinking like that' and I'm only comfortable talking to very few people because I don't want to scare people or be judged.
I struggled a lot with the decision to post this because I often feel like I don't have a right to be depressed because I don't have any significant issues in my life at the moment to have triggered it. But, my mind is constantly filled with a cloud of pain that makes me upset, frustrated, isolated, etc. I can't seem to escape it and it's almost like a weight is constantly pressing down on me.
I was just wondering if anybody has been through similar or has any tips on how to deal with depression with the constant everyday weight it puts on you as well as the individual episodes when it is particularly hard to cope with and emotions are heightened even more. I would really appreciate some help.
Thanks, T

Hey I don’t know how to do this so I guess I will start by saying I have been suffering anxiety pretty much since I was a child buy it’s only been very bad in the last 2+ years. 
 My family lost one of my brothers who, from what I was told from my mother, I had a special bond with. He was 9 and I was only 10 months old when it happened. I still feel our missing piece till this day.  A couple of years later my father walked out on us and moved state and he was never around or had never bothered. I had to see a therapist when I was a child cause of it.
All throughout school I was the main target for bullying, I still don’t know why but I guess it was because I was  quiet and never stood up for myself so I was an easy target, I never wanted to go to school and I can remember going to sleep some nights and hoping I didn’t wake up or I woke up somewhere different cause I didn’t want to go back to that school. The bullying stopped when I was 14 and finally cracked and started standing up for myself.
When I was 16 mum packed us up and we moved 4 hours away to the city where I could start fresh, I was in a new school, made new friends and every was actually going well for a while then when I was 18 I got into my 1st serious relationship. It was all fine at the start then it quickly turned into his gaslighting me, emotionally abusing me and constantly cheating on me, the relationship lasted about three years, my anxiety got bad again and I developed depression. He ended the relationship without a reason and all I wanted to do was end my life cause I thought I was the reason it ended and my self esteem was so low and I just felt empty and alone. I almost did commit one night but didn’t go through with it. Not long after I decided I needed to help myself and I slowly got myself better and the depression slowly went away. 
A couple of months later I got into my 2nd serious relationship, unfortunately he was here on a visa and when it ended the relationship was long distance for a while. He moved back over after a while and we started the visa and everything was fine up until the last 6 months of our  relationship he he got very weird on me but would never communicate but would complain when I didn’t communicate. A couple of months later I caught him out cheating on me. My anxiety got real bad after that.
i will continue this story on the comments cause there isn’t enough room for my massive vent on here.

I haven’t been on this forum for while. I guess not wanting to admit to the fact that I’m feeling exactly the same as I did 5 years.  Only now the dark side is scary and affecting everyday life.  Happy and fulfilled days are getting less.  I’m back to tears, for what appears to be no reason, restlessness and concentration are extremely difficult.  I’ve taken to scrapbooking to try to get my mind thinking about a particular activity and “achieve” something.  I’ve gotten so good at making cards for every type of occasion and decorative boxes that you can put just about anything in, to the extent that now I don’t know what to do with it all.  Sleep is basically impossible.  I feel as if I’m in a constant state of nervous unrest. I worry to the enth degree about everything to the point that I feel sick to the stomach and heart going a thousand miles an hour.   I have a brother-in-law that has severe depression problems and have mentioned the way I feel a couple of times to family, but just get “you’re just worrying over nothing” or “suck it up, there’s nothing wrong with you” it’s probably just menopause.  It’s taken me ages to write this as I keep deleting it thinking I’m just having stupid feelings.

Hello,
So I have posted several months ago that I was not happy working at my previous job. I was crying in the middle of the night, and was just anxious all the time. I have been seeing a clinical psychologist since I started working, and more recently saw a career counsellor as well. Everyone has been supportive of me to quit my job, and after 6 months I have finally resigned. 
It has been over a month since I resigned. I have applied to several other clinics but so far all of them have chosen other candidates. Naturally, I started becoming anxious and depressed again, as I am afraid that I have just ruined my chance of getting a job. On hindsight, I should have found a job first, then quit. But work was becoming unbearable for me, that I have decided to quit regardless of my status. One of the interviewers might have implied that I lack resilience, and this was a stab to my heart. It felt like everything I did was a mistake, like quitting my job in just 6 months, choosing that job in the first place, and even choosing that degree. I could not stop thinking about what I could have done. 
I just wanted to know for those who have been in a similar situation, what did you do to keep yourself positive and motivated? I really only opened up to my psychologist and partner about my situation. I didn't want to disappoint my parents, who have been so supportive of me so far.

Hi
I’m curious for comments on how effective anti-depressants are for different
people.
In 2006 I discovered the mood swings I’d had my whole life weren’t “normal”
and I was diagnosed with depression. Being medicated for the last 13 years has
made a difference. I no longer experience periods of unjustified rage like I use.
(A good thing) but the medications I’ve tried over the years have never
actually made me happy.
I’m like everyone else on the planet and want the magic pill that will fix
my woes but the medications I take just seem to take the edge off which is better
than nothing but not enough.
So basically I’m curious about how medications are working for people. If
your mood is a 1 does your medication take you to 5 or just 2?
I’m not after medication types or doses, I’m just disillusioned with anti-depressants
and want a gauge of weather I’m expecting too much
Thanks
Kevin

Hi Community ! 
I thought I would come for some guidance as I am really stuck and I have been for quite some time now. A few things since this time last year have completely turned my life upside down, I can totally say exactly a year ago today I had no idea what it was to feel depressed, anxious or anything like that but just a month later, I knew it all in one hit. 
 
There are a bunch of things that keep me awake til 3-4 am each night... what to do with my life (I don't know who I am or what I want to do and I have tried to experiment many things) why I have barely any friends, maybe one or two which I speak to every fortnight or so... and how can I find myself again. I am so scared every day that this might be me forever, because one entire year of my life has been spent trying to figure the hell out what is going on? 
I have a partner, who works a very demanding career and I rarely see or speak to him so it's tough. He does not quite understand this at all but he can be supportive. My family and I all have great relationships but we do not speak to personally about these issues, so I pretty much keep it all to myself and want to figure it out that way, they just know I am different as I spend majority of my days hidden in the walls of my bedroom. 
 
I keep wishing I can go back to over a year ago and be the person who was so damn happy, who woke up each day early to go to work and lived each day with purpose, the person who was rarely seen in their room, the person who was happy to socialise and just live! I want to do all of these things, but I just can't. I don't know if others will understand (I hope someone does) but I cannot get myself out of this without falling into anxiousness, depression / sadness or self doubt. 
Help help! 
 
Lots of love to all of you, been super supportive in this community. 
xx

Hello, i'm new to posting in the forums, though I have looked at them over the last year or so. 
I guess I will start with some background information, i'm 25, Male and currently studying my masters with 9 months to go. I have had anxiety for roughly 6-7 years (comes and goes). The last 2 years a lot of negative events have happened in my life,  3 close family deaths, 1 of which was unexpected and my partner of 4.5 years, after that persons passing developed serious depression and 4 months ago told me she wanted a 'break'. 
Now I know how all 'breaks' end, I guess what really has me at a loss is that we where a great couple, travelled a lot together, had talked a lot about the next steps in our life and then suddenly it was all over. 
Anyway that's a bit of a back story, my anxiety has well and truly come back with vengeance and I fear that depression is knocking as well. Im not sure on the next steps to take not only for myself but for my now ex, I have insisted that she goes and talks to a professional but it doesn't seem to be happening and she is after 'space'. For myself I have been exercising daily and eating well but if anyone has any other strategies I would love to hear them. 
While I am here the other thing that is making me feel down is that I feel 'old', now I hope I dont offend anyone saying that as i know 25 inst old by any means, I just cant seem to shake this thought. 
Apologise for the rant. I look forward to your replies.

Hi all
I have recently had a diagnosis of with Bipolar 2. It is as if everything in my life to date makes complete and perfect sense.
I grew up in an extremely abusive household. That aside my memories of certain situations and things I have done are now making sense.
I have been on and off anti-depressants for a very long time. They always worked fast and stop working after a few years. I have seen counselors and psychologists and finally gave up and went to see a psychiatrist. After a thorough and detailed history she said I think 'you have bipolar 2'.
Her explanations and discussion explained me exactly. More depressed than happy. Go for days feeling pretty crappy functioning and feeling so low and then out of nowhere I am happy. When I am happy I am stupid happy-over confident, can do anything, joking, singing, multi task off the charts, mind racing, chatty, obsessed with sexual thoughts but risky sex, the best way to explain it is that I feel 'high and floaty'. As suddenly as it comes it goes and I'm back to mopey. sad and thinking that everyone hates me. This has gone on forever. And got worse as I have gotten older. So now I am taking new medication at night to assist in a stabilizing my mood and and anti-depressent for anxiety/depression during the day. I feel relieved and even more so the nutcase. I have always felt alone and on the outside of what others call 'life' - friends, parties, travel cars, excitement etc. I am intolerant of superficial things and I can go from pretty okay to angry, angry in a flash. I hate anything that I perceive as unfair. I feel like an emo fairy. I feel like I have no tribe. I hate it and everyday it feels like I have to rebuild myself and put myself back together again. How do I make and keep friends? How do I trust after a childhood of severe abandonment?
Any comments or suggestions or stories or what ever helpful.

Hiya, I am not sure where to post this, tonight I've experienced an event and I have no idea what to make of it, I'm currently 25 studying a computer science degree and tonight I just broke down, I took a pair of scissors and cut all of my shoulder length hair off and snapped my favorite game console my Nintendo switch over my leg. I don't know what lead me to this, I'm kind of scared. I've been miserable recently, I've removed all of my photos from Facebook because I can no longer bear to look at myself, I feel so alone, I have no one I can talk to about this, I have been trying to discuss my problems with people in my life Iike my current partner but everyone brushes me off, I'm at my breaking point, I really don't know what to do...

Hi I suffer from major depression and anxiety. When I’m at the bottom strange things happen. For example I live in a quiet suburb and on land so everything is calm an quiet or slow paced. Today I was driven to an appointment about 45 mins away in a built up city. When leaving it’s bearable but once you get further into the city everything sort of explodes! Like there is so much stimuli going on with cars and merging lanes, blinkers, traffic lights, signs, anxiety from the other cars if they are going to run into you or stop short. And I just couldn’t take it, couldn’t even speak to the person driving felt like I was about to shut down with all the craziness, so confused can’t concentrate on 1 thing. 
Has this happend to you? Am I the only 1?

Hi everyone, 
I've been reading alot of the forums and they all seem similar to my case. I've been away for six weeks, my boyfriend with Depression and Anxiety was supportive because I had booked the trip before meeting him. We spoke everyday, texting all day, phone calls through out the day. Telling me that he feels empty without me days before I arrived back home. Felt like nothing was wrong. Only difference was he had an episode a few weeks before, cancelling all psych appts and medical appts, not going to work, not studying, not going to the gym, he had no motivation. We planned to sort through all these things together, he told me he needed my help and couldnt wait until I was home. 
Two days after being home, with again no real cause of concern, he dumped me. Said he doesnt feel the same way about me, had been feeling it for weeks. He blamed the break up on my neediness and insecutiries, and suggested I try and find myself. He discounted our relationship by saying it wasnt that long, however days before telling me how happy I make him. The man who broke up with me, wasnt the man I got to know for the past six months. The break up has completely taken me surprise and I am devastated. 
Any advice on the situation would be greatly apprecaited.

So I just needed to vent my thoughts a little. I don’t have depression so I don’t know if it’s fair to post in this part of the website but it didn’t seem appropriate for the anxiety part either (which I probably align with more). Anyway, I am 18 and in uni - I work part time as a tutor through a company (which is amazing and I love) and as a mentor/tutor at my old school. The latter is the problem. I work 2 hours a week and every week since I started I have sat here for 2 hours doing absolutely nothing. This is the perfect chance for my brain to start telling me all sorts of things and now I am sitting here and trying not to cry. It feels like the other two girls that tutor are always helping out and consequently I feel both useless and like I shouldn’t be here - like they made a mistake in hiring me. I know I’m not as smart as they are but I just feel stupid sitting here watching them. It feels like I’m wasting everyone’s time and money being here and I don’t know what to do. I am literally just sitting here in a now empty library and have done nothing. Since the term started, I’ve helped 2 students - were in week 8. I know these thoughts aren’t founded but I needed to get it written down - helps me control my emotions a bit more and I don’t want to start crying in the middle of my old school library...I haven’t really asked a question yet. I suppose I want to know, does anyone else ever feel like they just want to break down and cry? Is it ever for something as ridiculous as sitting for 2 hours at work and doing nothing? I mean that certainly shouldn’t be making me as upset as I am. I suppose that’s my anxiety speaking isn’t it...? Telling me everyone is watching me fail at what I’ve been hired to do? I’m thinking I might just quit. Probably not worth all this stress.

Everyday I feel empty. I wake up feeling empty, I eat feeling empty, I fall asleep feeling empty. The emptiness doesn't seem to go away. On top of this I have a sense of guilt, but im not sure what I exactly feel guilty about. I'm more of a type to bottle up my feelings before releasing it all out at once, which i've noticed makes me feel even worse, but I can't really stop myself from blocking out my emotions until it gets too much. I dont know if anyone feels this or if its just me, but everytime I go out with friends or others I feel like i'm not mean't to be there,my mind tells me that they dont want me to be there, despite also knowing that they aren't showing any signs of rejection towards me. I just feel like i'm jeporadising their time of fun, I feel like i'm ruining it for them. But, I want to be there at the same time cause I don't want to miss out, I don't want to go back to school and have them talk about this event which I decided to skip. I don't want to be seperated and unrelatable. I'm really fed up of feeling like this. I can feel offended and sad about someones comment or something they did despite it being such a small matter. An example would be me getting upset and angry at my friend because after me continiously trying to spend time with him because he had something happen to him, but everytime he would find a way to tell me that he doesnt feel like going or that he can't go. I know deep down that he probably isn't feeling well and that he wants some time alone, but I can't stop myself from being annoyed at him. Will this ever stop? Why have I become so sensetive?

I recently confided in a friend that I feel very lonely and depressed because I have so little social contact with any of my friends anymore.
I am now in my fourth year of uni and each year has been more difficult because friends don't have as much free time. I spent a lot of Fridays and Saturdays working over the last three years and couldn't go out but no one is free to do anything anymore now that I'm more freed up. My social life is one-way texts (me texting friends and not getting anything back) and brief coffees every few months that I have to work hard to arrange. 
I also feel bad because the only time my friends usually reach out to me is when they need help with assessment. I know they aren't trying to hurt my feelings but it's very bad for your self-worth when people only contact you unexpectedly when they need to improve their grades.
My birthday is also coming up in two weeks and I don't want to plan anything because I can't deal with being turned down by people anymore. With so many knockbacks when I try to have fun, I've resorted to doing heaps of things on my own.
Some of these things have been good but I still feel really lonely and depressed. When I told my friend all of this, she said I shouldn't rely on other people for my happiness. It's not that she wasn't otherwise supportive, I just feel out of ideas since I need to be social to be happy.
After months of going alone, I need more social time with my friends but that seems impossible. And given my struggles right now, that's all I need. Making new friends at 22 is confronting, terrifying and humiliating.
Any advice is welcome. I am still friends with that friend but I was a bit taken aback by her advice not to rely on people when I was just saying I need more contact.

I have been through some bad relationships in my past. I've been through two very emotionally abusive relationships and I've dealt with men seeing me as something to ""conquer"" for the past few years. It's made me very untrusting of men. I recently opened myself up earlier this year to someone who  I got along with very well. I've been quite closed off to the idea of being with anyone as I find I'm my most productive and my happiest self without the emotional weight of dating. This guy tried for quite a while though and eventually I allowed myself to enjoy being with someone. He made me feel really happy and appreciated, we spoke every day and given my experiences I thought I had a good read on him and could trust him. We slept together a few times, but then he began to change and wasn't the same kind, friendly person he'd been before. I became panicked at the thought that I'd let something like this happen to me again.When I voiced my feelings of upset to him, he didn't understand and tried to make me think that it had been in my head and I didn't have a right to be feeling manipulated the way I was. Whenever I try to express how I feel he tells me that I am being aggressive, having attitude or that I'm just starting an argument. He now treats me with no respect. 
This all happened in July and I thought I'd be feeling better by now but I feel worse. I've been through bouts of depression the past few years and am medicated for it. I usually manage to get over things quite fast as a result of the other things I've been through but for some reason this one is crippling me. I cry every night, sometimes I cry out of sadness and others its anger. He has no respect or feeling towards me and I feel like I didn't just lose a friend, but someone who I'd begun to open myself up to romantically for the first time in so long. I trusted him and he turned around and hurt me. Sometimes I feel like I don't want to do anything all day and the idea of getting out of my bed is even too hard. I regret ever speaking to him and I just feel broken.
I rarely cry over a relationship or a boy but this one has hurt me so much worse than anything else. I just want to stop feeling how I feel towards him and feel like myself again. I usually know how to pull myself out of these low periods but it's been a few months now and I am really struggling.

I'm reaching out because I have been depressed for a long time and haven't been able to make changes to get out of it. My depression stems from financial pressures and the toll that is putting on my family. The financial situation is getting worse and I'm wanting to change my thinking to help change how I approach my work and make it more successful. I feel like by keeping focusing on the negative I can't see a way out. I have little so motivation do what's necessary even though I have things I could do to help. My thinking is very clouded with the stress of it so finding it very hard to make good decisions. My husband has lost his patience with the way I'm thinking and wants me to get help. I can't afford to go to a therapist right now. I tried earlier in the year but felt it was a waste of time. I guess I want to know if it's possible to fix depression and how long it takes, I don't have years. What are some good strategies to change to more positive thinking that people have tried when the problem they are facing seems beyond fixing?

Lately i've just felt this emptiness and sadness that won't go away. Even if I see people I always feel lonely? I used to have a problem with drugs and part of recovering was me cutting off the majority of the friends I had at the time. I'd known most of them my whole life and even though cutting them off was the right thing for my recovery I still feel this pain of not having anyone who really knows me. It feels like most people my age have groups of friends they've known for years and thats what gives them confidence to meet new people and expand their circle. For me it feels like I'm starting from scratch all on my own and it's gotten to the point where my self esteem is so low and I'm so jealous of everyone around me. I don't know how to get out of this hole and I can't stop crying from the loneliness. Any advice on rebuilding friendships would be helpful.

Hi all,
i have a close family member who has depression (not diagnosed), she has had it for a long time and it’s continuing to get worse and I don’t know what to do anymore. She gets extremely jealous If positive things happen to others, she is insecure about her looks & weight and hates going to crowded places, she’s always negative and becomes irritable easy and thinks she is a victim of the world basically. I have tried being patient and listen, being positive to boost her mood, I have snapped at her at times because I seem to be her outlet for all she is feeling which is makes me feel down after speaking with her and she just won’t get help. She doesn’t think she needs to talk to a professional or that it will do anything and her physical health is not the greatest (she won’t do anything about that either). So I just don’t know what to do anymore without getting dragged into her negative feelings. Her workplace have pulled her up on her negative attitude and approachability but even this isn’t a trigger for her to change. 
Any advice is appreciated!

Hi all,
I have to relocate interstate and terrified about a Centrelink review for my DSP.
I will have new GP's, Clinical Psycologists etc. Not sure how they will understand me and support me with CL and the DSP.
Is the CL review process for the DSP as bad as applying for it in the first place?

Thank you and you’re feedback will be greatly appreciated.

I didn't want to self-diagnose anything and so i decided to try out all the online checks i could find - of which all also said the same. Even after so many tests, I wasn't satisfied as I am in my teenage years anyways so it may just be me being over-dramatic and moody. I have come here to ask if anyone could help me figure out whether i may actually be depressed or if it's just a phase (age). I am willing to answer any questions (may be brief though).
The reason I have been reluctant but to come here is because I can't go to my GP or anyone as I'm too scared for my parents to find out - I don't think they'd be very happy. Would mean a lot if someone could help me out because my behavior lately has been driving me and (pretty sure) everyone around me crazy. 
Thank you for your time and sorry for bothering everyone on here who have to go through so much more while i whine about my minor problems.

I basically live mooching off my family, I have no education, no work experience and I have not left my house in years. I stopped taking care of myself a while ago. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a long time ago and getting help has always been a hassle. I can't drive because I have no license and I have to rely on family to get me to sessions. After a while scheduling becomes too much of a pain and it falls to the back burner before I stop going entirely.
I just don't know what to do, especially when it comes to sustaining myself in the future. I don't expect people to support me my whole life and I feel like garbage for having done it for so long.
I am facing a
future where if I do get treatment I won't be able to get a job, at
least from what I hear no one will hire someone who is almost 30 and has
nothing to put on a resume and I am gonna go out on a limb and say that telling an employer you didn't work due to mental illness isn't going to increase my chances.
I just feel like I have no where to go in life

It's at the point where it feels like it's impacting every aspect of my life, that I'm shutting down completely. 
 
I'm one of those sad people who still plays Pokemon go, which I loved, because it got me out and about socialising (because basically all my friends are married and have their own lives now, so I feel like the single loser) and I loved that the group I was part of was so inclusive and didn't judge people on level, team etc, but lately it's like everyone has become so cliquey that people are going off and doing their own thing and not wanting to help and I don't understand why people would be so selfish. I admit I've been lashing out coz I'm frustrated, but I don't understand why people would want to be selfish and not include people and leave people out. Yet I feel like whenever I'm like ""that's pretty crappy behaviour, not everyone is as elite or has their own crew they can hang outwith"" some people give me this ""some people have access to enough accounts to do things themselves, people will get left out, get over it"" or ""soz, wasn't thinking. I had enough accounts to do it myself"" attitude (at least that's how the responses make me feel) and then it's like there's so much pressure that I feel like I need to do this and that, or play a certain amount and it's overwhelming. Then I get frustrated, coz I feel like nobody is listening to me and my concerns, so lash out, yet it somehow ends up being my fault.
And then I also feel like a worthless loser, coz I'm unemployed, live at home with my parents. Mum has bad arthritis, so she's super slow, then dad makes fun of her being so slow. 
Also went to a family gathering recently and got cornered by cousins who were like ""When are you gonna have kids? Isn't it time your parents have grandchildren?"" I'm 37, this weighs on my mind on a daily basis as to why I'm single and why nobody wants me, not just on a relationship basis, but work and friends (I've all but given up on asking my bestie if she's free for coffee, she's always busy with her mother's group friends)
It feels like I'm drowning in negativity and it feels like no matter what I do it's always my fault. I feel useless, worthless and not good enough. I'd much rather hide in my room forever and never come out.
I also looked at speaking to a psychologist, but they're like $200, an unemployed bum like me can't afford it.

Hi everyone, 
I hope you don't mind but I'm not really looking for a solution today, honestly? I'm just struggling to talk to someone about my latest depressive episode and I just want to vent a bit to people who won't judge me or look at me like I'm a freak.
I woke up today, and I just felt utterly miserable. everyone's been telling me I should be enjoying my holidays and relaxing but without a strict schedule to follow I feel like I don't have a purpose, which then makes me feel frustrated and upset because I feel lazy sitting around on my butt while my dad and siblings are busy working. unfortunately as many of you might now, all of my anxiety just builds up and explodes. 
Lately, I've also been feeling lonely. I've been trying to date and hang out with some school friends but I've just been finding it really hard to feel motivated to do any of that without feeling exhausted. I know I should try and be social but I feel awful because I've admitted to myself that I don't enjoy being an extrovert, simply because I don't feel like I can trust people. 
I'm really sorry to bother everyone, but I just wanted to vent and feel a little better. 
I hope your all managing your conditions well, 
Infinity

Just wondering if anyone has experienced emotional blunting? 
I have been on an anti depressant for some time and have just realised that I am emotionally numb. 
I cannot stand this feeling as I have not been able to cry or experience any emotion.
I have stopped my anti depressant for now and am feeling fine.
i just need my emotions to return and am trying to flush the medication out of my system.
Has anyone experienced this and if so how long did it take for your emotions to return to normal?
Thank you

I have been dealing with depression on and off for 20 years I’m 36 years of age and suffer chronic pain but that’s just a part of my life now. It’s the loneliness I can’t deal with all my mates have moved on with families and kids and I’m still the single one out of us all. I have recently had to move back home due to not working a great deal with this pain issue I can only do 16 hours a week and that’s not enough to live on so Mum rescued me due to lack of $$. So with all this going on my depression has increased more than ever and it’s scary. It’s hard to see all these happy couples and to know your going home alone to mums house at the age of 36. I try to do things with the boys but I can understand they are busy with the family so I’m left lonely again and the brain just runs wild with negativity I just don’t know what to do please help me.

Hi everyone,
I was dating a guy with depression for the last few months but recently he has stopped talking to me, fairly out of the blue. He told me that he was feeling really down and I told him that I'm here if he needs anything. It's been a few more weeks now and I've heard nothing from him. 
Can anyone shed some light on what it is like to start dating someone whilst you have depression? I want to help him but I also don't want to push it. What is the best way for me to support him?
PS I acknowledge that relationships just die of their own accord anyway but this seems very uncharacteristic of him. 
Thanks for your help!

Hi I’m new here and just needed somewhere to share what’s been going on inside me. My depression goes in weekly cycles and its mentally  exhausting. I’m not on medication and I don’t want to be as in the past they through me around a bit. I feel I can manage my lows with regular running. But when it hits me it really hits me and I don’t understand the reason for being alive. I don’t like this world and I don’t want to be a part of it. These thoughts immobilise me and I literally  cannot leave the house. I feel like I’m screaming through a glass box on the top of a hill and no one can see or hear me. Does anyone else feel this imprisonment and isolation of depression?

I am currently living with my daugther & boyfriend of 1 year. Some days i am doing great but the bad days out way the good days. Been struggling with my emotions, especially towards my boyfriend. One minute I can be extremely happy than the next I'm yelling at him or I start shaking & cry for no joke hours straight and I cant stop. It is effecting my daugther because even though it's not directed at her, she sees this emotionally unstable side of me that would make her feel like I'm not strong enough to be her mum.
Really desperately need advice or any thoughts on what my shaking and very quick /bad mood swings are the cause of. (I have tried going to the doctor but everytime I use any excuse to not explain that I need help as fear of judgment)

Hi all this is my first time posting. I have recently been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and I am struggling to find any clarity to the mess constantly in my heads. I am in a relationship of 12 year with two young boys (who I could never live without). I am scared because as hard as I try, I can’t seem to find the love I once had for my partner. It is taking every fibre of my being to feel it and it freezes me to a point of panic but a shell on the outside and the only light I can see or feel in the darkness is for another. This feeling for someone else consumes my every thought and is the only thing that seems clear. I guess what I’m have a lot of trouble with is, is it possible that these new feelings are real and my depression is feeding off my inability to accept I no long love the mother of my children? Or has my depression blinded me.

After many years with mixed success on medication for unipolar depression, I am trying a ' magnetic' treatment, we can't mention treatments can we hah? Have had the illness since I was 18 like I said with mixed success , have found the illness confusing at times but am looking forward to seeying if this treatment gives me some clarity, my mother passed two years ago so thats also made things interesting, I try to keep my sense of humour as it has kept me somewhat steady through some rough seas. Hah this has turned it to more of a ramble but yeah.

So im new to this and dont often share like this but im at a loss right now. I'm 30 year old guy if that helps. I started feeling this way maybe a week ago and it hasnt subsided so i dont know if its depression or what. Out of nowhere i suddenly was on the verge of tears at work, things i never though of before started flooding my mind. Things like, how im disappointed  in how much life turned out, job, social life, love life etc. I tried to stay positive and tell myself it will be fine, but that didnt work. My job is a dead end and i have to partner so im at home alone most of the time. Socially i dont really have many friends, maybe 3 or 4 but they have their own lives and actual careers so i never get to see them. My only form of happiness seems to be in the form of video games and tv shows/anime but even now i barely play any games. 
Im a bit overweight and thought exercising would help, so i started walking while listening to audio books and that seems to help until im done and back at home. Then everything starts to sink in again. Ive tried eating better and thats a dead end it seems, my appetite has gone out the window and for the past week ive had the equivalent of 2 ready made meals a day, like the jenny craig ones just store bought.
Basically im feeling lost, alone, and empty. Like ive got nothing and wont ever have anything. The one girlfriend i had when i was 20 hurt me in a way that before i knew it 10 years had gone by of me being single. 
Thats basically it, its not very well structured so i apologies for that but my mind is racing and all over the place right now so i tried to make it as readable as i can.
Just looking for advice, i cant turn to family since my mother i havent spoke to for years, my father is going on holidays in less than a week and i dont want him to miss them or have a bad time, he needs them.

Hi, I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety yesterday after going to my HR manager and breaking down in front of her. She promptly got me to contact my GP and make an appointment, he has referred me to see a psychologist, of which the first available appointment isn't until Saturday afternoon. ( The psychologist did say one may come up sooner) My HR manager said take as long as you need of work to help clear your head, my problem is I know how busy it is and feel guilty for taking time off to work through this diagnoses. I know everyone is different in regards to collecting their thoughts and getting back to being functional. Should I feel bad? or just suck it up and go back to work tomorrow and wait to see the psychologist on Saturday or use this time off to try and workout what is going on in my head?

I apologise for this stream of consciousness in advance, but I’m in a very bad place at the moment and need to do something other than... well... keep it inside.
im certain I will be fine later on but god it doesn’t feel like it right now. I havnt been “ok” in over a year now. I have been dealing with severe clinical depression and anxiety for years now but it was when my fiancée and partner of 12 years left me “because I can’t watch you be this sad anymore”. 
That statement would almost be sweet sweet if I hadn’t then found out she had been repeatedly cheating on me for the last couple of years. Her not loving me anymore and wanting to go would have been fine. Would have hurt, but hey, it’s an honest reason I could have respected. 
but finding out all the other lies and whatnot absolutely broke me. Since then Ive had a lot of trouble making new friends. I think I’m too desperate to be friendly and it comes off as dishonest, insincere or just plain weird. 
It also doesnt help that at my age (26) everyone has their friendship groups pretty nailed down and breaking into someone else group can be hard.
 
but right now I’m at the end of my rope because I have not had any kind of social interaction with anything resembling a friend in over two months now. I keep trying to make plans, and nothing ever goes through.
i get the usual excuses/reasons, life is crazy, and getting people together when everyone’s got jobs or studies is hard. I GET that. But two months is starting to feel ether deliberate or a cruel joke.
im the person people come to to talk about all their problems. People message me for advice, and help and I’m happy to give it, but when the conversation turns away from the topic at hand, the conversation ends.
as the title suggests, this is more about venting for me than asking for help. I’m DOING all the “things” I should be doing outside of seeing a psych (I’ve used all my cheap visits, and have racked up 2000$ debt with psychiatrists following the breakup) I’m trying to reach out to people, I’m giviv them ALL the benefit of the doubt, I’m trying to meet new people through volunteer work and I’m chasing a new job.
im trying not to be desperate. But I AM desperate. 
i like my alone time but I feel so horrifically and comically alone right now and there is nothing I can do apart from “keep going” for no logical reason. 
there is ALOT more going in but word limits are a thing. I’m an open book, so ask away, or vent yourself if you need to. 
I’ll listen.

Hello friend. This is my second post on this forum. 
I'm not sure how to start, so I'll just be direct. It feels like I've got the ball rolling; sorry about my use of banality. I feel there is a still a sense of purposelessness, are we in a chaotic universe where we just exist and die or a cosmic universe where everything happens by some sense of meaning? 
But yet, I can't see a grey in this answer. 
I've spent so much time playing video games and it feels like I have been deprived from experience. I have no social skills and for some absurd reason, I never had my education as high priority. I'd rather sit and play video games and hope the world forgets me. Love, feelings, thought, physical, conscious, experience, history; nothing matters. For years, I've tried to come to terms with this, Albert Camus had a philosophic book and view that the world is absurd and finding meaning will only drag you down. 
 No matter how much I try, is any effort actually worth it? I'm not here to say I want to hurt myself, in fact, the opposite. I want to thrive in this world. I'm just so anxious about this place where we live and it feels people force meaning into things when in reality it does not matter. 
Everywhere I look, they are either this or that, left or right, rich or poor, soccer or football.  I am not unique, I'm a simpleton, I follow my favorite team, I say soccer and not football. 
I am my worst enemy and I cannot find peace. I want to thrive but all I do is think, anxious thoughts turn into depression and depression turns into anxious thoughts.

lately I’ve been feeling like I’m starting to fall back down that dark hole again. I haven’t been there in a long time. It started with the small thoughts just those little ones to make you feel a bit worthless, makes you question yourself, your worth, your purpose. Then it started to get a bit darker and I started having thoughts about how life would be better without me, other people wouldn’t care if I wasn’t around. Those sorts of dark thoughts that can really weaken your mindset. I’ve been trying so hard to just remind myself that they’re not true and maybe I’m just over tired from work or maybe I’m just bored with how my life is right now but I have things to look forward to in the coming months I just need to be patient, I’m going to graduate soon I’m going to start a new career next year. I shouldn’t believe these thoughts but I’m also so so scared that I’m just trying to convince my self everything is okay, like sugar coating when really I’m just ignoring the beginning warning signs that I might be falling back into depression.

please if anyone has any way I can try and fight these thoughts to help me stay strong and to not let it progress any further then please provide me some insight or advice. I don’t want to fall back down that dark hole, I’ve been winning this battle for 2 years now and I’ve come so far. 

Thankyou.

Hi I’m new to this forum.  I’ve suffered depression for most of my life unfortunately.  I recently spent a night in a public hospital as I didn’t know what else to do.  Felt I just needed ‘time out’.  I sat in the waiting room in Emergency from 10:30am until being admitted to a bed in Emergency @ 4:30pm 😦 I was assessed firstly by the Dr & then a psychiatric nurse.  I was moved to another area (emergency overflow) & I was desperate for a good nights sleep but it was extremely noisy in this unit 😧 I got about 3hrs sleep & that was after a sleeping tablet! The nurse saw me again in the morning & he said I would be discharged (which I was nervous about as I didn’t feel like I could go home as I was still in a bad way) as I wasn’t ‘bad enough’ to be admitted to psychiatric ward & I wasn’t a suicide risk.  I guess that’s a relief in some way but what I was disappointed with is I felt because I didn’t have a physical injury/illness I was not required to be in hospital . 
So, I feel after this experience, there needs to be some sort of respite house for mental patients to have some time out.  Not a hospital as such but somewhere quiet, safe & secure.  I guess it comes down to $$ & staff etc.  not everyone can afford a private facility.  Just wondering about other people’s opinions.  
PS I am seeing a Psychologist & taking medication. I do feel I’m getting better, but some other people may not be as fortunate with friends/family for support

Hey everyone,

I'm a 26 year old guy who feels lonely, afraid and worthless. I've never had a girlfriend and feel scared when I approach women. I don't feel like I have friends who care about me, I've never felt part of any groups, don't get me wrong, I try to put in my best effort but it's seen as being desperate by few while others take advantage, and I let them out of fear of being lonely. I tend to have mood swings which push me to my extreme positive, rare as it is, is the only chance I get to speak with women. And then the feeling goes away and I just stop talking. I know all of this may sound like a childish plea for attention and I'm OK with that as long as I can get some help. I want to make friends I can trust and rely on, I want to meet my other half and not just stare with greif and jealousy while I glance at others living their happy lives. Can someone advice me on how to approach people without reeking of desperation and how to talk to women randomly, not like in a suave James bond manner but in a way that I would atleast go up and talk to them.

Hi All,
I'm Dawn and I'm new :)
I have struggled with anxiety and depression since my early teens, but I think overall I've managed pretty well on my own.. 
I'm turning 30 in two months.. and the most amazing thing just happened, I finally moved into my brand new house after 3 years of building misery. I have two beautiful cats, two beautiful bunnies and a pretty good job.
So why aren't I happy? :( I feel annoyed at myself, while my life certainly isn't perfect I think its pretty good and most people would be more than happy to have it. Silly me thought once I moved into the house and settled in everything would just be perfect, my own happily ever after.. 
Unfortunately moving into my new house caused my anxiety to go AWOL.. then my depression decided to join the party. 6 weeks later and I am starting to feel better, but I thought I would try some counseling anyway.. but I don't think it really went well and I'm not convinced I'm going to go back. 
I guess what I'm trying to ask (while also introducing myself) is have you ever gotten everything you wanted (or something you wanted) and then found yourself not as happy as you were hoping? What did you do?

Im a registered nurse and im beginning to hate it and regret ever going into it.

I just feel so burnout, the work load is too much, theres never enough staff, management is the worst and putting more and more pressure on us each week. I hate it! Absolutely hate it! I dont want to go back but i dont know what else id do for a job! 

I always thought being a nurse was where i want to be but since working where i am now theyve just killed all desire i once had.

How do i find out what else id want to do for work? 

Right now i feel like theres nothing id be good at or will like and its sending me into another severe depression. I havent been able to east for 2 days now because im so stressed and anxious, i just feel too sick to eat. And i dont see my phychologist until the end of the month..

Hi, I'm new here. Hoping to find a safe place to talk about how I am feeling and what contributes to this. I'm not quite sure where to start. About fifteen years ago I lost my mum to cancer.  At the time I coped as well as I could but as the years have passed I have struggled between anxiety and depression and my thoughts at times have taken me to some pretty scary places. In this time I have had a couple of relationships which have fallen into the not so healthy category or as a friend says, toxic. My family life has been pretty much non existent, which has really caused me pain. I don't feel like I belong anywhere, feel alone, unloved, to the point where now I should be putting myself out there but it's like I have given up. Two years ago, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I've had some financial stress  and started to not cope so well and put on a lot of weight from bad choices in food and alcohol.  I've also struggled with finding the right help amd been on and off anti depressants for years and became quite used to benzos for coping. A recent wake up call a few months back with a cut back in anti depressants lead to insomnia issues and a relapse into a big hole of depression.  I have improved somewhat with regular doctor visits and a new approach of not prescribing benzos any longer. It's like I have just scratched the surface and I feel that I have wasted years of my life being in this depression.  I feel like a failure,  so alone, don't know how to trust or open up to people and spend a lot of time on my own. I've also come to terms with the fact that I have not been enjoying a social drink for years,but drowning my pain instead. It's like part of myself has just given up. I struggle to get up and go. And then feel guilty. I'm not sure if much of this makes sense. I am just struggling to move forward and it's like I don't know how to be happy anymore as it's been so long.

Hello Everyone on the Beyond Blue Forum & Staff. 
My Introduction to All.
This is my First Post to Beyond Blue though I'm familiar with this Excellent Forum. I have returned to the BB forum for support because I found it helpful so I have decided start/join again. Everyone who posted in the past did a great job.
So Thank you for having me back Beyond Blue. 
I haven't much to say due to severe anxiety/depression/post traumatic stress disorder. Am on medication, see health professionals regularly to keep things in check. 
Beyond Blue Thank you.

i have depression. not very surprising. im pretty much used to it i guess. im used to being in an on and off (mostly on) depressive episode. im so SO tired but oh well, what can i do, right? 
a lot of my friends know about this and they always tell me theyre here for me. so i vent to them if i need to. the sad thing is, i think theyre getting sick of me, because theyre giving dry replies, such as ""oh damnn"" or ""idk what to say sorry"" or ""yikes"". and these replies just make me feel 10x worse, so i have decided to isolate myself and be alone with my thoughts. 
sometimes it becomes too much and i blurt out things i wasnt planning on saying. last week i suddenly said ""when will i ever recover from depression??"" out loud to my friend. and she said ""you wont because youre not even trying.""
that hurt. so much. i am trying so hard to get better. everyday i wake up and go to school. i hold back my tears as much as i can. i try SO SO HARD not to think dark thoughts but its hard. i feel like my brain and i are separate people, and i cant control my thoughts. my thoughts control me. i really REALLY wish people would understand that. 
my friend thinks im not trying because i still say depressing things a lot of the time, but i cant help it. i genuinely cannot control my brain. my brain is a bully, and is in charge of all the bad thoughts. i, on the other hand, am trying to block the bad thoughts, but im miserably failing because im not strong enough, my brain is too loud. TOO LOUD.
im trying as hard as i can. im just so tired of trying to be louder than the bad thoughts. the bad thoughts are screaming and i have to scream louder than them. im so tired of having to block the bad thoughts. i am so tired. 
im in highschool which doesnt help cuz the schoolwork is hella overwhelming :/ and that adds to my tiredness. at this point i have given up on school and all my hobbies and idk where i can get my motivation back. (im getting off track lol) anyhoo i just really REALLY wish people would understand one thing: 
my brain and i are separate people. my brain generates all the bad thoughts, and even though i am supposed to control the bad thoughts, i am incapable of doing that. so they end up controlling me. i dont like it, and theres honestly nothing i can do. I REALLY AM TRYING PLEASE BELIEVE ME PLEASE DONT CALL ME LAZY BECAUSE IM TRYING IM JUST SO TIRED :((((
please help me

Hey,
First time posting. Ok, so this is somewhat difficult to explain, I’ve never been to a doctor for mental help but it is on the horizon. I’ve recently opened up to my wife and parents about my mental problems that I’ve been having. 
I’m currently having problems with my mind constantly creating scenarios and thinking of the worst possible situation that scenario could be and getting me worked up to the point that I get really angry with what has happened even though the situation isn’t real and possibly won’t become real. Constant negative thoughts. 
It’s really starting to affect me. It gets me depressed quite regularly and I really need to learn to think of positive situations. 
Does anyone have any tips on how to switch on a positive mindset? Meditation? Yoga? 
I do realise that this post quite possibly makes no sense but ask me any questions and I’ll answer as best I can to assist  
FYI - I’m not into seeing a doctor for medication. Nothing against people who take it, it’s just not something I’m willing to do. 
Cheers

I'm feeling really trapped and depressed at work. I have two  degrees in
fields that are related and am scheduled to finish my part-time postgrad studies next year in a more abstract but somewhat elated field.

However,  I can never get a job in the areas I want, no matter how many qualifications I get. So I take something else, hate it and change jobs. I have a CV
containing six of these entry level jobs unrelated to each other or my qualifications. Plus  degree assortment that is beoming more unrelated. I never like my jobs because they are in areas I don't find interesting. Now I’m in a part-time job I've had for 4 years and I hate it.

I saw a career advisor last year for a small fortune. She reviewed my CV, told me what jobs I should apply for to build my career, how to explain my different jobs ect. So I started looking for work a year ago and I have not got one interview. I spend so much time on so many applications. I saw a second advisor for free at university. They
had different ideas on CV writing. Asdid did the next career advisor.  And so does every career forum. I applied for jobs that I am
overqualified for related to my career interests but still got rejected. I ensured my CV ect. and LinkedIn are updated. Networking was useless plus I have social anxiety.  I volunteer lots but that's a dead end. 
I am really depressed. I cry all the time. I told my therapist but it didn't help. I can't afford my income, I suck at my job, and it's stressful and unfulfilling. I don’t like the people, the work and it's boring, Career development is nil (I am so sick of entry level work that I won't move up in). I avoid my friends because I am sad and my job and the failure to find a new one after so long is embarrassing. What’s worse
is any nice people are leaving for other jobs so I feel like a failure and lonely without even one interview. My
friends have get better work recently with careers. 5-10 years ago I got interviews for
at least 30% of jobs. Now I can’t get one for career starter jobs.  I have no experience
in the fields I like - just degrees from 5 years ago- and a disjointed career/study history of 14 years that can't be explained away. I'm just unemployable stuck
in this depressing job forever. I get no sleep and  work makes me ill. But I need the money. My studies suffer too as it feels like a waste to study when I won't be able to get a job. 
Any advice on how to learnt to be happy in a
job you hate but will be doing for the rest of your life?

Hello, 
As of 2.5 years ago, I’ve started to feel really down and lonely. I used to work in hospitality and as you can imagine, I’ll be working long hours and mostly on weekends and public holidays too. I never really had the chance to catch up with my friends outside of work as they all work Monday to Friday 9-5 jobs and they would only ever be available on days that I’m working, however it didn’t bother me as much because I enjoyed working with the colleagues. 
I ended up leaving my hospitality career and pursued a whole different career in a corporate environment. I found it extremely hard to adapt and make new friends but over time, I got used it. Things have quietened down a lot and the busy lifestyle I had was no longer busy. I was excited at the same time because now it meant that I could see and catch up with all my friends. Over time, I saw my friends less and less and I can appreciate that everyone is probably busy but I always feel lonely. I always find myself asking and reaching out to friends to catch up but at the same time I wish they could make an effort to organise something for once. 
I feel like if I don’t initiate catch ups, we probably won’t see each other for a good couple of months. On Instagram, I always see stories of them going out with their other friends or their “group” and then I start to question if I mean anything to them at all. I’ve reached out to them and brought it up on several occasions but they all believe I have high expectations of what good/close friends should be. 
Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy my alone time and some times I’d much rather stay at home and watch a movie but I cant help but envy people who have a tight group of friends or friends to hang out with in general. I’d start questioning why I can’t have a group of my own etc. 
I’m certain I’m not alone but how have you dealt with situations or feelings like these? How can you over come feeling so lonely?...

Hi
I am a major introvert and have been feeling depressed for the past 2 years, but I thought it was normal. But I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety towards the end of July 2019. I was prescribed with antidepressants and did get some support from my family, but that was just temporary.
I had to put more effort into pretending that I was happy and okay, in order for my mum to stop stressing and worrying about me. My dad is another story, he blames me for overthinking, but is it my fault?
For a while after being on meds, I thought, maybe I was getting better, I haven’t felt down in a while.
I was never the type to let myself dwell over things, especially things that made me sad, so when something traumatic happened, I never let myself focus the sadness and my emotions. I never gave myself time to come to terms with my problems. I’ve always pushed everything to the back of my mind. I did everything I could to escape reality. I binge read books, I binged watched series, I stopped caring so much about school.
A month and a half later, I feel like the medication isn’t working. Am I supposed to be feeling so down? Even before my diagnosis, I don’t remember feeling so emotionally drained.
This led to me being too ‘tired’ to do anything, and I don’t think my family fully understands what I’m going through. I think it’s impacting on my relationship with my parents and my siblings. I’m just so done. Everything’s falling apart.
I’ve been told by my GP to only take half a pill before bedtime, but there’s been quite a few days where I want to take one whole, just to be able to feel relaxed again.
This is what had happened. The first night I got the antidepressants, I accidentally took one tablet instead of half like I was supposed to. I remember feeling drowsy almost immediately and being able to relax for what felt like the first time in forever. I want to feel that again. I’m tired of being so tensed all the time, so anxious about everything when I know I shouldn’t be.

Hello All, 
I am hoping that you can help me with a bit of advice. My partner is currently going through delayed post-marriage breakdown grief. He is the one who ended it but after months and months of distraction, he is now facing the full front of pain and emotional confusion. We are keeping a distance because he has asked me for time and space. We have been absolutely wonderful together, so I am happy to do whatever is necessary and useful for his recovery. We do see each other regularly due to work arrangements and we do have a lot of nice times with a bit of a laugh and a few small touches or warm smiles here and there. I know he is not going well but we do not talk much other than work, so I cannot gauge the progress. 
I have noticed that he is currently fairly withdrawn on any emotional topic and that even when we spend some time alone, he is strangely pulled back or non-committal. Then again, we kiss occasionally when the opportunity permits and it is always as beautiful as always. But then again, in other moments, he is definitely not as warm and inclusive as he used to be before he started the grieving. I would be absolutely ok with it if I knew that it is the grief ""talking"", so I thought I would reach out to see whether these behaviours are somewhat linked to depression and grief. It makes sense to me that he would dial everything back to the bare minimum because he cannot cope with his emotions and the confusion and chaos. Is that what is likely happening right now? 
He told me he is not going well and that his head is going crazy. And I know he is looking forward to a long weekend alone soon. We had nothing negative between us and laugh together. He was very much drawn to me and I believe he was in love. Now everything is cooled down and friend-like sometimes. Then the next time, we flirt and he gets excited. It is up and down and strangely non-committal sometimes. I would just like to understand whether I need to be worried about him losing interest out of a sudden or whether it is because he is trying his best to cope with the difficult life situation. If the latter, I am happy to give him all the time and space in the world. Do you think after the grief, normal feelings return? Before the break he said it is only a see you later, not a goodbye. He felt very strongly and positively about us. At the moment, I am completely confused by this man's behaviour but I love him deeply and want to be there for him until he gets out the other end.

Ok everything I’m gonna say think of it as not psychically. 
So I sometimes wake up and my head feels like there’s a loud sound inside it (again not literally) I don’t know how to explain it I don’t feel pain, I don’t know why I would be scared, I don’t hear noises or have any psychicall symptoms just want to hold my head and I squeeze my eyes tight! My heart would sometimes be pounding and other times not. I tend to be ok falling asleep I just lose track of my thoughts quickly and have I have more awareness of my pre sleep visions which can sometimes cause me distress. But anyway my head all of a sudden after waking up just feels like it’s vibrating (not literally) kinda like I’m stuck in my own head but I’m not actually thinking of anything besides “calm down your fine” it doesn’t last to long and I can get back to sleep fine. I tried to explain it to my psych but she didn’t really give me any idea what it is. Hope someone can help 
thanks

Hi, I am a single Mum who is not coping with a lot of things. I am angry all the time and I don't know why, but then I don't want to be around people at all, I get sad and I have a lot of regret from when I was 19 and made a decision that has wrecked me. I am also  confused about my feelings toward a friend. 
I am seeing a psychologist but I find it hard to talk about things in person and I  am apparently afraid of my emotions and don't let them out.

Hi everyone, 
Today I'm struggling to find something to pre-occupy me. Legally I'm supposed to have a carer watch over me due to my strong medications. I have a lot of interests but today it feels like one of those days where you start something and then move on and do something else.
When I'm manic (based on memory)

Impulse buy
Eat
Act like I'm high on drugs
Talk to people of the opposite sex
Sex on the brain
Speak at a million miles per hour
Demand a skipping rope
the tv and music are too stimulating and so is watching the road as a front passeger, 

Based on depression:

I was rather manic and deranged
I was singing sad songs
I was wanting to stay away from a girl called M... she was another person with bipolar going with ECT. She was always sorta in my face.

Strategies:
Manic: art, music (567 songs and still counting), comics, knitting, cleaning (I'm a messy person) but I really did tidy up the house in just a few days my SO was shocked... usually when I clean I make a mess, walk the dog if i can stay calm
Depressed: I do as above but i dont feel like doing it. I don't have any motivation or energy. I wake up in a house that's empty. Well I'm also here on forums wanting to find someone or people who can relate to this. There are days where I question who I am, is it me or not me and question whether I said the wrong thing?
This is my first time being alone on recovery. So I've been in psych wards twice. And my last two episodes were voluntary and hypo... my meds are high risk the psych said if i need a higher dosage i'd have to be hospitalised.

Hello.
It was almost 6 weeks when the doctor told me that my pregnancy was not progressing at all and that I had to go through a surgery called d&c. This all happened pretty much this week and I'll be very honest, i still am very very upset about it.
Before the surgery and was told that I had missed miscarriage, I knew slowly my depression has started to hit me right in the face again. I've been battling depression for 5 years and ONLY started really getting better this year after I left my 4 year abusive relationship. Imagine the trauma i was dealing for 4 years..
I was recovering just this year when I found out Im pregnant (from a different partner) and then found out there was no baby at all.. I guess what Im saying is, it is really hard. I have BPD which makes everything a lot harder already and then miscarriage happened. Doctors said it wasnt my fault and that nothing I could have done to prevent it but despite, I cant help not to blame myself and how unfair life is. It makes me back track to what happened to my past with my ex before and not really getting the justice I know I deserve to now taking away the blessing I thought I would have.
Im hurting. SO BAD.
No one knows in my family because 1. it was unplanned pregnancy and they will be disappointed if they found out and im only 23 and still studying and 2. I dont need any more drama more than what I am facing now.
My partner has been supportive however there are moments we could have ended up breaking up because everything was going downhill and he was having the hardest time to understand me and where Im coming from. I dont blame him though-- I am too much most of the time.
 
Yesterday, I was just at the emergency from panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. Thankfully I didnt have to get admitted otherwise it would've been my 3rd admission in a psych ward and I dont want that.
I've got essays that are due next week and the following week and I havent started any of them(though I refuse to take a break because that was what I had to do last year when I was very sick from traume and etc). Mentally, I know im not coping very well at the moment. Havent been eating well too.
Any advice or just encouragement would be nice to hear.
Thank you.

Hi, I have been dealing with depression for the last 2 years and probably one of the things I have been struggling the most is the lack of energy which I think it doesn't help at all in order to feel better. I wake up tired, I barely have energy to do anything, the house becomes a mess which makes things worse but I can't find energy to do hardly anything. 
At the moment I'm looking for work so the whole situation is bringing me down.

Do you suffer from triggers? What is a trigger?
For me, a trigger is a moment that panic can set in quickly. From that moment on it is a battle to overcome the fallout. Often a panic attack will accompany the shaking, the stress and for me anyhow- the overwhelming temptation to- cry.
Today it happened. My wife and I went for a drive for coffee. Lovely sunny winters day arrived at our favourite country general store café at a very small town only to see the ""closed"" sign. Ok, we'll go to a country house nearby where they advertise Devonshire tea. As we pulled up the thought came to me about cash. The other place took eftpos which is what we use all the time. This little place isn't likely to take cards. As the old lady approached I didn't have time to talk about it to my wife...in fact the old lay was impossible to interrupt so I could speak about the matter. On and on she talked as we walked about 50 metres to the ""tea rooms"" all the while not able to talk. 
As we arrived at the rotunda I had to interrupt but the shakes started and I was desperate with wanting to ask my wife if she had any real money. So out it came ""do you take eftpos"" I asked. At that exact moment an old man called out to the old lady something about taking his dogs to a friends place. She walked towards him out of sight. So I didn't get my answer. This freaked me out more in frustration. I turned to my wife and asked her ""I hope you have cash""?  ""Oh, she thought, ""I don't think so"". I had to return to the car where I found $8 in coins then returned and my wife found $5 in her purse. The old lady returned and we asked the cost of Devonshire tea and she replied ""$16""- we were short $3. She was ok with that and being locals we'd make up for it when seeing her in town.
The event shook me up. The rotunda and nearby sheds had jugs as a display many of them so it was a distraction. About 20 minutes later I was 90% recovered. The overwhelming desire is to cry but being older and male it doesn't come.
Distraction is my tool for recovery. I don't think there is a better or faster remedy. Do you know of any?
Prevention is better than cure and having $50 or so on you is the preventative measure. We'll try and do that of course.
Feel free to contribute.

I am not sure what to say, or how to say it. I can’t be open and talk about what is going on in my life with the one closest to me. I give the barest details but stop.  I am emotionally numb. I have been working through a mixture of problems relating to depression and sometimes I go weeks with a nightly broken sleep of about 3 hours. My strategy in dealing with this when it occurs is damaging to my real ship and makes me feel worse and I spiral. I don’t now what to do any more. I have a feeling of immense shame and embarrassment. I know I’m making poor judgements I know I need help of some kind but I don’t know what to do. I say my problems out loud and they seem like attempts at excusing action. The trouble is I think I am handling everything so don’t seek help. Then it overloads. I can’t bring myself to walk into room to tell someone my problems. So I destroy the ones I love. How do break your fear? How do you take that step into something that scares the hell out you?

I know I'm going to sound petty and pathetic but I have been feeling moody and very distressed for almost two weeks. I find myself feeling anxious, getting stomach cramps and headaches and feeling like I'm going to cry every few minutes.
 
After my sister's behaviour got worse, my mum and I decided to cut ties with her. Yet a few days later my mum decided to rebuild the relationship with her again. She (my sister) has been dishonest and always made excuses for a very long period of time and has made me lose complete trust towards her and other people. I even find myself doubting my mum even though she's always been loyal, truthful and supportive of me and my wellbeing as well as my closest friends. Even when my mum talks to her on the phone and she (my sister) says hello to me, I feel cold when I reply to her.
 
I feel so conflicted because I don't want to deny my nephew of seeing his aunt (me) yet I don't feel like I can cope with rebuilding my relationship with my sister again. I'm trying to focus on my current training to become a teacher so that I can move on. Yet I feel worried that I may get to a stage that I may have to face her and that I'm going to lash out at her for the betrayal and hurt that she has caused me and mum.
 
I know that there's no solution for my problems. My mum says that seeking counselling won't help with my problems and I am hesitant to talk to my friends because I don't want to burden them.
 
I don't know what to do anymore :'(

I should know better. I work in the paramedical field and acute medical issues / presentations are common. Yet I deluded myself to think I was alone, or immune to the impact of critical care. I’ve struggled for years, always thinking I was less than in my suffering. Attributing my issues to something different. I was trained fully prepared for the realities of a society. It wasn’t until my life met a critical overload that had been building for years, and a crisis that I was i was ashamed of that I reached out to this site. After reading others posts, the daily struggle they face , well it med me feel that there was a community within our society. I know the road is long, but I have hope now and maybe more understanding. So thank you all

Hello, 
As of 2.5 years ago, I’ve started to feel really down and lonely. I used to work in hospitality and as you can imagine, I’ll be working long hours and mostly on weekends and public holidays too. I never really had the chance to catch up with my friends outside of work as they all work Monday to Friday 9-5 jobs and they would only ever be available on days that I’m working, however it didn’t bother me as much because I enjoyed working with the colleagues. 
I ended up leaving my hospitality career and pursued a whole different career in a corporate environment. I found it extremely hard to adapt and make new friends but over time, I got used it. 
Things have quietened down a lot and the busy lifestyle I had was no longer busy. I was excited at the same time because now it meant that I could see and catch up with all my friends. Over time, I saw my friends less and less and I can appreciate that everyone is probably busy but I always feel lonely. I always find myself asking and reaching out to friends to catch up but at the same time I wish they could make an effort to organise something for once. 
I feel like if I don’t initiate catch ups, we probably won’t see each other for a good couple of months. On Instagram, I always see stories of them going out with their other friends or their “group” and then I start to question if I mean anything to them at all. I’ve reached out to them and brought it up on several occasions but they all believe I have high expectations of what good/close friends should be. 
Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy my alone time and some times I’d much rather stay at home and watch a movie but I cant help but envy people who have a tight group of friends or friends to hang out with in general. I’d start questioning why I can’t have a group of my own etc. 
I’m certain I’m not alone but how have you dealt with situations or feelings like these? How can you over come feeling so lonely?...

Hi all my first post.
 I recently resigned from my corporate job and have 1 and a half weeks till I finally leave, early May.
 The job pays 80k and I have no other job lined up, luckily I have managed to save money up but I could not cope anymore as my depression was overwhelming me and my workload was ever increasing. The company is very disorganised and I was given no training or handover with 4 major projects and management didnt care they expected me to deliver by working unpaid overtime.
 It came to a head one day when I started crying at my desk, luckily no one saw me. The work colleagues are horrible and evil, one of them was making fun of me saying I was going to fail in delivering one of the projects and another guy said I was too ugly to have a girl friend. I have been single for a very long time but have a few close female friends but I m in the friend zone only which probably only adds to my depression and loneliness.
The sheer workload every day makes me anxious and I struggle to get out of bed on workdays, even on my days off I cannot sleep and when I do I get out of bed at 1-2pm as I have no motivation whatsoever.
I have told them I am leaving for personal reasons as I plan to spend time with my elderly mother, I did not trust them to tell them I was depressed and unhappy in the company and my role. I actually asked for 3 months Long Service Leave but they said we were too busy and they couldn't let me have time off. I have 9 weeks sick leave and I sometimes think I should have taken the sick  leave instead but I know deep down I hate the job and the company and all that will do is delay the inevitable. 
I m scared of not having a job especially when I was paid a decent salary, I haven't looked for one as I don't know what to do, I don't think I can work anymore in evil greedy Corporate Companies that use you, I was only making the Execs rich working all the extra hours.
But I realise my mental health is suffering and I have to walk away from all the noise and get my health, happiness,  motivation and passion back. Its actually hard for me to apply for other jobs when I m so depressed all the time as this will show up in job interviews, its hard to hide. I am worried when I apply for jobs the fact I quit will go against me, but I did work for my current company for almost 10 years.
Has anyone been or is in a similar situation and give me advice, I m so unhappy all the time and hope it will lift when I  walk out the door.

I don't know where to start, so I am sorry if this is a little messy. I love a guy and he loves me. He suffers from Anxiety and Depression while I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder. I do go through Anxiety and Depression, but I don't fully understand the extent he goes through. I helped him this year to figure out the issues that he has been holding in. He is seeing a psychologist, however, as soon as he realized his issues (because I was the first person in his life to ever tell me his deep dark secrets) He has been distant. He has told me he has so much self-hatred for himself that he feels like he is treating me like crap and I am better off without him. It's hard for him to see me face to face as when we did see each other he was shaking and wasn't coping at all. We haven't seen each other since early June. When he asked for space. I didn't give it to him as my disorder fears abandonment. I would harrass him unwillingly not to deliperatly harrass him, but to try help him and to keep him in my life. It got to the point that he got really angry at me. His anger is formed from his past that he is still trying to get through. We didn't speak for most of July. I thought I'd message him, but he got angry at me for messaging him because he said he will contact when he is ready and I wasn't respecting his decision for space. I wasn't respecting his needs. He tells me he loves me and he needs to get better to be a better man for himself and for me. He told he needs to get on top of these issues and he told me that his plan is to contact me when he is ready, he just doesn't want to hurt me in the process, but having bpd is hard when someone tells you that. I feel like he will never come back. We haven't spoken since July 29th. It's September 6th. I see him on social media talking to people like he is okay. When he did that in the past he said they were a distraction from his real life problems and they weren't close to him to know about his depression and anxiety. I feel he won't come back. I feel he just said space to let me down slowly. I don't understand this self hatred and leaving the ones you love. I need understanding. I trust him, he has never lied to me before, but I feel like I am stuck in limbo and I feel like he is testing me as well as trying to get through his issues to see if I will contact him because he truly believes I cannot give him space because I have stuffed it up in the past. Anyone have a similar story? I am suffering.

Hi my name is J,
In the last two years  - I have had two hypomanic episodes where I could still somewhat function as normal: my symptoms were not obvious . I feel that these are worse than when I was in full episodes yet I cant remember a lot, which is probably why. Going through this episode, not being put in hospital, and coping with being alone during the day makes me feel lonely but i choose not to have any trains of thoughts but by being pre-occupied with something. I'm a high maintenance/ require a lot of things to do to burn off at the beginning - but now i feel flat and on the depressed side which is usually me.
SO 
 My questions are:
Have you had a hypomanic episode?
How did you know/feel/think you were having one?
Were your symptoms obvious or not obvious?
 
It's emotionally and mentally draining watching myself having hypomania
 
Hope to hear from you - I am actually depressed... I have no friends they're more aquaintances

This is my first time posting on these forums so I don't really know how to start this.
I don't know if I may have actual mental health issues like depression or if I am just lazy and stupid. I'm 20 years old and a university student but I hate it. I've spent 3 years failing classes & am on the verge of getting kicked out because if it. I find it so overwhelming & exhausting, I find it difficult to even think about study without spiralling into a sickening panic & I can't seem to motivate myself to work. I feel too stupid. I can't concentrate. Instead I end up zoning out for hours every day basically doing nothing but trying not to think about uni. I fail classes because I can't get the energy to do any assessments & eventually stop showing up to classes because I can't get out of bed. My parents (who I still live with) have no idea how bad it is since I act normal & go to work & say I am doing uni stuff when they ask, they don't know I failed any classes let alone might be expelled & I'm too humiliated to tell them.
I also have no friends, I was on the outskirts of my friend group in high school & once we graduated I lost contact with most of them. The ones I still talk to occasionally are more like friendly acquaintances, we have nothing in common & the thought of meeting up with any of them just makes me feel anxious & depressed since they all have great friends & hobbies & are about to graduate, meanwhile I feel like I'm stuck in this dark hole & don't want anyone to know how pathetic I am. I have no hobbies or interests anymore, when I was 16 I began to lose joy in the things I used to like. Now I just spend most of my days sitting alone in my room. I just feel really low and hopeless most of the time, & can't imagine a future where my life is worth living. 
But the problem is that I can still act normal around my family, I can go to work & paste a smile on my face, sometimes I will be doing something & not feel sad at all & think 'maybe life isn't so bad' (although that vanishes as soon as I remember my fear of university or loneliness or my hatred of myself). So am I depressed? I can't shake the feeling that I am just a lazy person trying to excuse their laziness. I don't know how to go about seeing a psychologist & I'm terrified that they would just tell me that what I am experiencing is normal & I am just too weak to deal with it like everyone else is, & I'm too ashamed to tell my parents I'm struggling so badly.
I have no idea what to do.

Ive really tried for years,  over and over to think postive. To act positive. To work on my fitness and my health and be happier.  But its wearing me down. Listening to the news is so sickening. The amazon is burning down, the reef is dying, the animals are becoming extinct, the world is polluted , about to be hit by astroids and going into recession if we dont nuked by crazy politicians. Diseases are out of control. I used to donated to save the children charities (like millions of other givers)  but  the children still look as starving and homeless as ever.
In my humble opinion the corporate company I work for part time takes advantage of its female workers.  I cant trust the  people I thought I could trust. I struggle on my income and have no idea what will happen to me when Im too old to work in the not too distant future. Ive worked really really hard all my life but have hardly any superannuation or savings due to previous partner arrangement.  My current partner keeps his own money and dosnt share.  
I just dont see the point anymore. Its too hard. I used to have a lovely smile but I cant even get the corners of my mouth to lift. Its like there are lead weights there. I had a day off today. First day off in about 10. I had so much to do but I still have my pjs on and its 4.30pm. I just feel like a failure and an idiot all the time

Hi my name is ""J"" as a pseudonym and I am a 26 year old female. I have had the mood disorder bipolar disorder since 2011. So far I have had 4 different types of episodes - so it makes my life and my carer's life a little more challenging to identify symptoms of bipolar. I rarely tell people I have bipolar - the stigma is still there, even though the psychiatrist says I'm an elevated person - I'm rather depressed and pessimistic. People treat me differently when I say bipolar yet if I said depression or anxiety it appears to be an accepted thing.
I've gone through a lot in 2018 for my 2nd last episode - ask If you want to - and to this day it still affects m - I think during that period of my time I literally became a broken person. It was one problem after the other.
I am being currently cared for but sometimes I get upset when he offhand says something like ""taking you the hospital would've been easier"" duding a tiff...        I cried a bit     he was the one who adamant about me not getting placed into the hospital.
I'd like to get to know more people who are like minded:

I have a dog
Does occasionally garden
Likes knitting
Positive mind set
Creativity
I have a few aquariums
I am a closet otaku I like reading anime, manhwa, manhua - because I've quit smoking for almost a year now
I am not sure if I am asking for too much but I am open minded
I rarely drink its about like 5 days of the year if you want a number haha

Hi all,
So I’m new here but not new to depression. I was diagnosed with major depression disorder several years ago and have been through therapy and still on medication. Last year, my doctor and I decided to taper down my dosage since it seemed I was doing well. But yesterday, after numerous bouts of those familiar intense negative thoughts, feelings of suicide and wanting to self harm again for over a month - I decided I needed to go back up to a dose.
Among all these issues. I’m becoming severely addicted and obsessed with the thought my SO is being unfaithful. I have been cheated on by a horrible ex in the past so these fears are not entirely unfounded. With my current SO, I believe I’ve become hypervigilant to anything he does or says. Right now, I’m obsessing and worrying over the fact he goes “online” on a certain app very often. When he’s online on this app, he completely ignores me. But when I’m with him, I never see him go on it. He doesn’t shy away from using his phone and numerous other apps around me, but this one he seems to avoid (or just not feel like?) going on it around me. Sometimes he says things that he’s sure he’s told me, and I get a horrible feeling it’s because he’s talking to someone else and forgets who he actually mentioned it to. My memory is bad though, so I can’t be too sure. He randomly decided to diet too. He makes innocent jokes when I receive a notification on my phone like “oh is that your other boyfriend”, etc.
I don’t know what else to mention. I’m just a mess of worry and guilt for even thinking this. He makes it a point to despise cheaters, even so far as being personally annoyed by cheaters in TV shows. I feel he has the same morals when it comes to cheating, but I’m still drowning in these nagging, insecure thoughts.
I hope someone is able to give me insight. Like if this is common for depression to amplify these paranoid thoughts. I’m sorry for my incoherency.

A few years ago I was admitted to my local regional hospital which is quite small. I have a diagnosis of clinical depression.  I was placed under an admission order and was flown to the nearest capital city where I was admitted for quite some time.  There is quite a bit I don't remember.  Slowly life is becoming more stable I guess.  One thing I have found is that I am a healthcare worker and I can no longer get work at my local hospital (where I was admitted as a patient).  It's quite a worry as I am a single mum with teenagers to support. I have 20 years experience in what I do and had no problem with gaining work prior to my own personal admission.  I don't even make it to the interview phase, my resume is usually rejected straight away. My psychiatrist says that I'm fine to work. Any thoughts?

Hey all, 

Not entirely sure how to start this but here we go.
I'm 21 and I've been dealing with what I think is depression since somewhere in the middle of high school and until the beginning of this year it's just been fairly manageable but lately it's getting way too overwhelming for me and it's severely affecting my study and performance at work, not to mention my home life. 
I'm constantly feeling tired, no will to do anything whatsoever and my care for the consequences seem to be dropping at a rapid rate. The thought is kind of frightening. I basically feel nothing most of the time which is accompanied by just a bunch of sadness and anger every now and then.

The thing is I feel like I should really be enjoying life at the moment, my jobs are great, I love what I'm studying, I live with my loving Boyfriend and our two cats in an amazing house and we aren't stressed financially or anything. I just have no motivation to do anything whatsoever, I struggle to even get out of bed every day because it's all way too exhausting for me to handle. 

I've been going to the doctor every few weeks for the past couple of months about something unrelated and I keep intending on saying something to my doctor or at least booking an appointment specifically to talk about that or at least try to get a referral to someone who can help but I just can't seem to bring myself to do it. I don't want to ask her and be told that they can't do anything to help considering that's what Ive been told by the last two GPs ive seeked help from. 

Basically I just need to know if anyone can give some insight on how to overcome this fear to ask for help and I suppose how to ask it because the thought of talking to people about it is terrifying and all I want is to begin to enjoy my life again. 

Thanks for listening to my rant aha..

About 18 months ago I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. After the initial 6 months of hell, things seemed to settle down except for a few bumps in the road. That has all changed. Last week everything fell apart!
It is 10 years since my mother passed away later this year. Last week was her birthday and while I was putting flowers on her grave I started thinking that it should have been me that got sick and was in there. She had things to live for, she missed out on being a grandmother. Me, I’m now in my late 40’s, single never married, no kids, basically nothing to live for. 
Since then I’ve just gone further down hill and feel like I can do nothing right and am a burden on everyone, to name just a few of the emotions. I just feel so low and have been keeping to myself. Last year I confided in a couple of colleagues about what I’d been through so in any future bad times they would understand what I’d been through and in the hope they’d support me and have my back and check in if I didn’t seem right. They all treated me like I was in a bad mood or had some deadly disease. Not one of them asked me if I was ok! The people I thought I could trust to support me let me down. Made me feel worse, so alone and like no one cared.

Hey,
My name is Angel_423. I'm a pretty average person. I strive academically, I have the most hysterical laugh and I crack awkward jokes. 
But recently - nothing feels 'good' anymore. 
My parent's fight. A lot. And when I get between them to allow them to calm down, they drag me into their fights and then I side with my mum because she is very timid and my dad is authoritative. But then, I get yelled at. I'm called the reason why the fight started in the first place. I'm sworn at. And they say actions speak louder than words - but not really - it hurts. The words hurt. 
I just want things to go back to normal, but they don't. Something big happened and my mum doesn't talk anymore. My baby sister isn't getting the nurturing family she deserves and my dad is self-obsessed. I don't know what to do. 
I just want to be happy again. 
I'm feeling my energy slowly, painfully being sucked out of me. And sometimes I just can't breathe. If I'm quiet then people ask me what's wrong but I can't say anything because a lot is happening at school and I don't want to burden my friends with anything. I just want things to be normal again.
I try to forget, but then I enter my home and it doesn't feel like home anymore. I can't focus. I need someone - anyone - to talk to. Maybe this isn't depression and I say this because I do feel happy when I forget. But as soon as I come back - I'm sad. No one gets it. I'm too afraid to speak up, I don't want to burden others.
I just want to talk. I just want to be normal again. I want to laugh hysterically, I want to be awkward and weird... I want to be the old me.

So I am in a group chat with my two friends who are dating. They are always so cute to each other and it makes me so happy to see them so happy together. One time when they were being all cute and stuff they guy sends a voice note of him singing ""I love you a bushel and a peck"" from Five Feet Apart. It was at this point when I got down for some reason. The girl was crying cause she was so happy and I was just kinda listening now. They continue doing their thing, but the real breaking point for me was when the guy said, ""I told u I would send u to the moon."" I just  couldnt hold it in. I feel so lonely and empty. No one will ever love me like that and it hurts knowing that. My ""girl friend"" broke up with me after one day cause she liked someone else before I asked her out but she said yes. The whole time we were dating she was talking about how she was over this guy and that she likes me. The damn morning after we first got together she says I like the other guy still and idk if I can make it stop. Then her friend started sending me messages saying that she liked the other guy more than me and that I should break up with her if i was a good friend. She eventually told me this which just shattered my heart. At this point Im convinced nobody can love me now that I had my emotions just played with right there. I dont know what to do anymore

My partner has been seeing a Psychiatrist as he possibly has Bipolar disorder. Now 40, his moods change from day to day from overwhelmingly happy to angry the next, sometimes several times per day. 3 weeks ago, he just stopped contacting me. He said he just doesn't care anymore about anything and he's realised that he just needs to be alone as any relationship he has seems to always be on his terms which he acknowledged was unfair on me. We were high school sweet-hearts and have only re-kindled our relationship since the beginning of the year (even when we were young he would end our relationship often and I never knew why). The first few months were amazing (with the exception of a mood change here and there) He said he'd never let me get away again and I was his sole mate. He is on medication and has been since December of last year, which I thought was working well (so did he). Then he ran out of his script whilst working away and everything came crashing down (as he didn't realise you shouldn't stop AD suddenly). He is taking them again now but since then his moods have been very low and the depression has slowly been creeping up on him and now he's finding it hard to cope with day to day tasks and seems to not care about our relationship or much else. I asked him to maybe just take some time out for himself and wait until this dark cloud has lifted before he makes any decisions about ending it. In one of this last texts to me last week, he apologised for everything and told me that he has been trying to pull himself together but the more he tries the further he seems to fall and I was perfect for him. He then thanked me for trying my hardest to understand and that he thinks of me every day and what he has missed. He then went on to say ""I am so angry at myself you have no idea, I'll always love you"". I'm confused and worried about him. I'm the only one who knows about this possible diagnosis and I feel I need to do more to help. I also read that if someone has Bipolar disorder, often there needs to be a mood stabiliser and maybe an anti-psychotic prescribed as well? In the last few weeks I have been educating myself on Bipolar Disorder so I can understand what it is that's going on in his head and how I can help him. I've learned allot about Bipolar but am still unsure of how to go about helping him if he doesn't want me around atm. If he's anything like what he was when we were young, he'll come back but meanwhile I feel helpless. Please help?

I'm 52 and would like to give you a brief overview of the unfortunate event of my life (FYI: This is all real and not even half of it). Don't get me, wrong, I have 2 fantastic kids and have had some really great times in amongst the crud.
I suffered from Sexual abuse as a child (11ish fuzzy memories), Abandonment by parents at 14, arrested and locked up for 3 months for joyriding in dads car at 15, serious car accident cutting jugular at 15, broke my neck 16, Married at 20/divorced 21.
Married again at 22 and was mentally and physically abused by (unstable) wife for 14 years. Both she and I were kidnapped, I was forced to run guns and drugs across borders while she was held somewhere in Nevada, USA. Lasted 4 months of terrifying experiences and threats.
Diagnosed terminal in 1996 with no chance of recovery (Change in diet and lifestyle...20 years on ...still here!).
My ex-Wife hired (seriously not kidding) someone to kill me and my new partner and child, was forced to flee Aust.
There's more but you get the idea, I'm a basket case that keeps having really bad things happen, but I keep smiling and keep trying. Soldier on, they say, Talk about it can make it easier, they say. Time heals all wounds, they say. But none of this is true. I have reached that point where I don't get why I should change to fit the world. I am angry inside, feel the world is unfair (and it is) don't see the point in playing the game according to the established rules of society. I just want to find somewhere to be! Somewhere to grow a garden and not deal with the BS of the real world. Money, in particular, seems to be the cause of a great deal of anxiety, depression and stress & I hate it.

Any suggestions would be great, But before you reply with ""go see your Dr"" or the like, I have for years but can't afford to go any more. Have no access to qualified professionals and those I did have access to were all spouting the same rhetoric, Talk, Drugs and Time. BS I say.

Hi, this is my second thread and wasn't sure if it would fit under my previous one. Anyways, when I was in Year 9 I had burnt my hand but the boiler in the boarding house leaked. And then after the school I went to had this camp that everyone went to for a term. During that time I had complained to the nurse that my hand kept on having a tingling sensation. So she gave me these meds that helped get rid of the tingling sensation. However, when my Dad saw the medication he told me it was also an anti-depressant, which shocked me (I stopped taking it when I found out). Long story short, can taking anti-depressants in a short period of time affect you mentally in the future?
Thanks for reading

Yes it’s quite hard at times because even though I feel “good” quite often I am not. My wife acts as my baseline but recently I suspect that she to is now suffering with depression secondary to putting up with me. Poor thing, I feel awful about it but while I am unwell there’s not much that I can do. Or is there?
So I am just wondering how people ground themselves to reality. I have been through a breakdown, aka break through, and suffered significant cognitive dysfunction afterwards. I am healing slowly but am hoping to find the Holy Grail here. Lol.
cheers

I’m stuck in this space of feeling sorry for myself. It’s stopped me from really moving forward with things that will help me get better.
I was diagnosed with postnatal depression when my son was 8 months old. He is now 2.5 years old. I’m still cycling in and out of what is now depression. I was also diagnosed with complex ptsd a decade  ago from an abusive marriage.  I thought I was well beyond the grip of ptsd. I worked with my psychologist for 5 years! But it’s back with a vengeance. 
I’m usually such an independent I’ll do it myself person. Even when I left my abusive relationship the only way forward for me was making it happen for myself. 
But now after having a baby and living with my partner I found myself clinging to my partner and relationship for dear life. 
I had depression issues almost immediately after having my son but it took a long time to realise what was happening and what I needed. During that my mental health took a massive toll on us, my son and his two girls. 
My partner recently asked to separate. He removed his two girls and had them live with their mum full time and is still sharing a space with me and my son. But he is planning on moving out for a month and then I don’t know what will happen. 
We see a couples therapist who said it is a good decision even though I don’t want to separate. I was crying and breaking down in front of my partners girls when triggered.  It was traumatic for them. I felt like such a horrible person for hurting everyone around me. But I couldn’t stop and get better.
I hadn’t known my partner long before I found out I was pregnant. I’m from overseas I no family and only a handful of friends who can support. 
I’ve found myself begging my partner to change his mind. He says he isn’t leaving but needing a break. But in anger says he is done. 
I have reached out to everyone I know to tell them what is happening. 
I’m so lost this morning I curled into a ball at my partners feet and begged him not to go to work. I told him I don’t want to be a mother anymore and that I just can’t cope feeling like this anymore.
I’ve just had my first psychiatrist appointment and she changed my antidepressant. I see a psychologist fortnightly and a couples counsel or fortnightly with my partner. 
I don’t think there is anything more I can do but stop feeling sorry for myself but I just can’t get there.

For the last couple days I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed with starting university again and the demands of work. 
I feel like I’m soo far left behind academically and it’s too late to ask my tutors for help and other students already made their little group of friends. I don’t want to disappoint my family for wanting to take a break this semester...
I can’t speak to my family members cause I’m scared of disappointing them and the last time I opened up to a friend ended our relationship (I haven’t spoken to her in weeks when I told her about my ‘eating habits’.

Hi everyone,
I was recently diagnosed with bipolar II, but am slightly confused about the diagnosis for a couple of reasons. First - the hypomanic element. I have read that hypomania falls generally into two different kinds - euphoric hypomania and irritable hypomania. I experience both (not at the same time - on separate occasions). When I am euphoric, I dominate conversation in social circles, have increased self-esteem, am intensely focused on particular activities,  have lots of ideas etc. More commonly though, it manifests itself as extreme irritability; I pace a lot, get frustrated when people cannot keep up with my ideas, am angered easily, quite paranoid etc. Is that possible to experience the two kinds of hypomania? Another concern of mine is that I do not have sleepless nights. I definitely have a lot of difficulty going to sleep/winding down at night (staying awake until 2 or 3), and often have restless nights and wake up feeling fine. But I have never done something like stay awake for 2 days. Does it still count as hypomania if my sleep is as I have described? 
Second, when I am depressed, I only am completely debilitated for less than a week (as in, can't get out of bed, feel suicidal etc.). For the rest of my depressive episodes, I find it difficult to muster up the energy to socialise, utterly hate myself, am not motivated, cry for no reason, feel worthless etc. but am still able to do things like go to uni, do an assignment, or see a friend if I need to. Do my depressive episodes still count as depression? 
I am concerned that I in fact do not have bipolar and am rather just a really volatile person trying to justify my erratic behaviour when it is just who I am.

Hi, I’m new here.
I’ve just been diagnosed with bipolar 2 and have started on medication. The diagnosis is a relief and a disappointment at the same time.
I’m finding it hard to make sense of my life & am becoming fixated on all of the horrible moments in my past due to this condition. It pains me very much & I feel so sad. I cry about it every day. I’ve been struggling with this for 27 years & I suppose I’m grieving for the life I could’ve had & the person I could’ve been without bipolar 2.
Even though I’m sad, I don’t feel sorry for myself. I know that a lot of people have it much worse than I do & I have so much to be grateful for. I just feel like I can’t talk to anybody about it. My parents brushed it off & my husband doesn’t understand why I’m so sad. He is very supportive & positive though.
Unfortunately, while I have lots of friends, I don’t have any close friends that I can talk about this with. I’m not close enough to any of them to burden them with these difficult emotions & thoughts.
So, that’s why I’m writing this post. Just to feel heard & perhaps to be understood a little. I appreciate anyone making the time & effort to read this.
Thank you,
Emmyay

Hi there,

I have been struggling with depression since I was 14, it has always really been a part of me, a bedrock 'emotion' that is just normal for me to feel. My self confidence has always been 0, especially in regards to relationships, and I thought and accepted for a long time I would be alone for the rest of my life. I had contemplated suicide through my teens, wanted to do it, but ended up chickening out on many occasions because the idea of death frightened me. I'm 20 now, and recently by some miracle got my first girlfriend. I thought the depression would just go, however it has been quite the contrary. I still don't feel it likely or very possible she likes me very much, but I'm rolling with it, living in an ignorant bliss for now. We are planning on meeting again (long distance relationship), and I can't be in this state when we do. I just don't know what to do, other than obviously speaking to a therapist, but it feels more comfortable asking for help online. 

Thanks,
Cicero

So I'm 17 years old in my last year of high school and I honestly just want it to be over. Throughout my whole schooling life, I've always looked forward to this year, thinking it would be the best year of my life. Needless to say, I am very underwhelmed with the experience.
 
So last week I discovered that my best friends had made a group chat without me and were using it to talk badly about me behind my back. I had noticed that something was wrong because they had started acting distant, ignoring me, finding excuses to not be around me etc. I considered the idea that they maybe they had made the group chat but brushed it off, thinking that it was all in my head and I was just reading into it. 
 
 But I was at a party one night and I saw the group chat on each of their phones, I saw one of my friends opening the chat and it was just the four of them in the chat, so I know it wasn't for another reason. They realised that I had found out about the group chat and didn't talk to me at all for the rest of the night, although they never really talked to me in the first place. The day after I message them about it, explaining that I was really upset and asking if they could at least tell me what I had done to hurt them. 
 
None of them could really give me a straight answer but it had something to do with them thinking I was mean. (for context, my friends and I had this thing where we all would jokingly insult each other, it was never ill-intend and was all out of love). I didn't really understand because we were all mean to each other it was kind of our thing. 
 
Since then, they have apologised for making the chat and we are kind of back on good terms. But recently they all went to someones party that I wasn't invited to (the guy doesn't like me, I thought we were friends but oh well). At school they keep talking about the party and pulling people aside so they can talk in private. It feels like they're going out of their way to leave me out and it's making me worry that maybe the group chat has started up again. I have major anxiety about what people think about me so this is kind of freaking me out. 
 
I'm not the most popular person and these are the only friends I have, so I don't have anyone to talk to about this. Hopefully this helps :)

It has lead a very private person to spilling her guts online as she has no one left in her life. This is so embarrassing it must be my therapy! I have long term treatment resistant depression and was previously a superwoman caring for 4 others now reduced to someone who can only get out of bed to pay the bills. At 57 I know I will now remain single as I'm a recluse due to lack of confidence. I don't know what else to say really I wish I could turn my mind off and not feel the painful memories of the past as that's your only company. I wish everyone all the very best, I feel every waking minute of your pain, with love xx

Hi all! 
I'm new here but my problems aren't new. I'm a compulsive liar.
i remember telling little lies when I was younger, like, if something wasn't done or forgotten my mum would say ""we will just tell your dad this.."" that seemed to be the easy way out for everything.
As I got older, my lying increased, more so when my parents split and my dad drank a lot and my mum cut me off to spend time with her ""friend and his kids"" and only wanted to spend time with me when it was convenient. I gradually worked out how to lie to my parents to get what I wanted, whether it was to get out of going to school or to play them against each other. I knew it was wrong but I wasn't getting caught so it was easy. 
Then my dad found someone he wanted to spend his life with, he became a different person, but I stayed the same. I continued to lie until one day his now wife picked up on it, my dad said ""she wouldn't lie"" but I was. Always lying about something so that I didn't have to deal with the consequences. The thing that no one tells you is you have to remember every little lie you tell or it's going to come back and bite you on the bum and all that ""perfectness"" will turn to crap and stopping isn't just as easy as saying ""hey I just won't lie anymore"" you cannot stop yourself, the words just come out of your mouth and that's it. Another hole you've dug. 
Fast forward to today, where my lies have dug me into such a deep hole I cannot get back out, I'm anxious, I can't sleep, I'm depresssed, I've lost pretty much everyone that cares about me because of the lies. Today I decided that I'm tired, I'm tired of letting everyone down. I'm tired of feeling this way. I called someone for some help. I have to fix this before my daughter picks up on it and thinks it's okay to live your life this way. It's not. Anyone who's reading this and thinking that a few little lies are okay, it's not, those little lies turn into bigger lies by the second. Then eventually your lying becomes so out of hand that even when youre telling the truth no one believes you.
Sorry for the ramble I just needed to get it off my chest. I just feel so alone because of all the lies that I'm left with no one. 
thanks for reading

Ever since..my father used his money to look after me (cause no one else wanted me..) I've always made him angry or disappointed in me. I started school and immediately to get bullied so I moved schools and the same thing happened..i was told I'm an easy target which scared me a little since I knew what high school bullies did to someone like me. 
I got bullied psychically which made me not care what they did to me for a while, I tried telling my teachers which did not help (not surprised..) I'm really good at hiding emotions which mad me sadder then usual. I have an eating disorder and have got a little fat..since I had this disorder it made me steal food (which I hate..) and this made my father very mad..Ive tried so hard to eat healthy and exercise but its no use..I have 3 sisters (that I cant see anymore..) I miss them so much and every time I see or hear sisters I get a little sadder..my own mother didn't even care about me when she found out I had autism..
 I honestly don't know what to do anymore..

Hi, 

So, I've been suffering from depression and GAD for around half a decade now, and because of this, I've pretty much had no motivation to do anything other than sit at home on my computer to distract me from everything else.  
I'm in my 20s yet I haven't learned to drive because I'm too anxious too, and I haven't pursued any careers or education because I have no idea where to even start and even if I did I probably wouldn't have the motivation to start. 
I've contemplated selling my computer so I have no choice but to do other stuff, but my fear is that I've come too dependent on it since I'm usually on it during 100% of my free time and will just get even more depressed. 

Basically, my question is what are some good ways to motivate yourself to actually get out into the world and be productive and not be a hermit? I really want to improve my life but I have no idea how to. I am completely and utterly lost and just need some guidance.

Any and all help is highly appreciated. Thank you

So I will get to the point. 
I'm currently in my second year of my bachelor science degree and recently I enrolled into a unit that proved to be way too much for me to handle. Now not only is my grade for other units suffering along with it, but I feel a lot of anxiety and depressed on a number of occasions. My solution for this is to withdraw from that unit, but since it has past census date, I will have a W (Withdraw) on my transcript from now on. 
But I'm also afraid of having the W because some people say it could affect future employment and make me look like a quitter. There is so much on my mind right now, I don't know what to think right now.
I just really needed to get this off my shoulder. 
Any advice and constructive comment is welcome 
Thanks

I'm not sure if I'm depressed or not. I have been able to be happy and actually feel lately but for the past week I have been unable to feel. I am familiar with being numb but am unsure as to what exactly i am feeling. I have been isolating myself from friends. I feel nothing but am overwhelmed somehow.

I’ve been on antidepressants for the last 8 years. I’ve accepted that I will never be cured of depression and that it may come and go in waves for as long as I live. Recently I noticed signs of depression in my partner and I encouraged him to see a GP. He was prescribed medication over 3 months ago, and while I’ve seen some small improvements he remains unmotivated and is constantly in a low mood. He spends every weekend in bed and doesn’t help out with household tasks. I am struggling myself at the moment with my own depression, but I’m trying to put on a brave face for him. However I feel like I’m failing him, like I’m not equipped to help him because I’m messed up myself. How do I help him through his depression when I’m depressed myself? On a side note, we have a 5 year old son together. He is my everything and everybody comments on what a happy and friendly little boy he is. I’m worried about the impact of having two depressed parents will have on him. Aaargh, I’m so tired but these are the thoughts that whirl thorough my head and keep me up every night.

Hi all,
Im looking for some ideas. I was on anti-depressants for two years then my doc switched me to a different one which I had bad side effects from. I was working overseas and having tapered off the old one, I thought I was fine so decided to just not bother continuing with the new one. Three months later, the depression has hit me like a truck. I’ve re-started the first medication and I’m trying to push through but I have a high stress job and zero energy or motivation. Does anyone have ideas on getting through the weeks until meds start working?

I've had depression and anxiety since I was a kid, and I'm currently a 24 year old female university student. I made plans with my best friend to study abroad this semester, at the time I was very anxious about it but thought it would be good for me to step outside of my comfort zone.

However, it's been so much harder than anticipated. My best friend always needs me to handle everything for her and this has been no exception, I've had to organise and plan everything for us with little help from her. Instead of providing us accommodation like I expected, the school abandoned us to deal with it on our own and I had to book 4 different airbnbs for us, all no where near our school, and all in incredibly tiny studio apartments where I'd have to share a sofabed with her. Then, I booked all our accommodation around a mid semester break where I planned to visit and stay with a different friend in another part of England, and the school suddenly and without warning got rid of this break and I cannot extend our accommodation to stay during those 2 weeks because we can't afford it. On top of all this I still don't even have my class timetable. 

I don't know what to do, having to handle all these problems by myself has left me at a depression low I haven't seen since I was in high school. I've had multiple breakdowns and cried more in the last few weeks than I have the whole rest of this year. I really just want to cancel this whole thing and stay home, I feel like it would be a relief and I owe it to my mental health. But on the other hand, because my friend has left me to do everything myself, all of her travel plans have been organized by me so I can't cancel this without completely abandoning her and throwing her under the bus. AKA she'd have to find all new accommodation on her own. On top of that, my Father organized to come with us for the first 2 weeks so he's gonna be really upset too.

I don't know what to do, we leave for Europe in a month and this week is really the last week I can cancel these plans without losing lots of money/leaving myself time to enrol in classes in my home university. If I cancel now I think we could get full refunds for everything, but I don't want to ruin my relationship with my best friend and my Father....

Hi all, I've never really used these kind of forums before so bare with me.
Over the last few months I've managed to get myself into a pretty dark hole. I've taken months off work, putting pressure on my collegues and burning bridges, falling behind on all my bills, getting into debt and almost getting kicked out of my uni course twice.
I can go weeks on end without leaving my apartment, which I live in alone, without having any contact with anyone.
I'm lucky enough to have a great support network, but most of the time I have no interest in seeing anyone or doing anything.
Most of the time I'm not even depressed or anxious, just numb. I drink too much, sleep too much and spend most of my time watching movies and avoiding the world.
I honestly just don't know how to get myself out of this. I'm now so anxious about going back to work in an office where in sure there has been eye rolls and comments made about my extensive time off and unreliability.
I've let friends down on many important occasions by cancelling on them and I can feel them losing their patience with me. I just feel like a broken record.
I'm on meds and starting to see a new counsellor next week, but my self destructive patterns have become so severe I just can't see how to get out of this.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

Hi. Im Sue. Im 52. Ive had depression most of my life. Ive learned heaps through psychotherapy and did improve on the meds i started 20 years ago. However, i struggle with feelings of meaninglessness and hopelessness most of the time. I push myself soooooo hard to eat, shower, exercise and do the basic stuff, but frequently (like right now) i just get sooo tired of pushing. Go for a walk, get out of the house, just do it, call someone, see the dr, do some craft, meditate - whats the point. Im so tired. What do you do when you push push push all the time and do all the suggested things but just run out of strength to make yourself do anything? I spend way too much time on my own and as of just recently i no longer do the very part time work i used to do. Im very relieved to not have the stress of having to work but I guess it's allowing me to isolate more. I'm just so tired. So tired.

So I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression a few years ago and since have have on and off antidepressants. At the start of the year I felt like I was finally ready to come off tablets and have been doing well until recently.
i don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore but I feel like I’m lost everyday and have nothing positive to say. I have no motivation to get up in the mornings. I have recently gone through some difficult times in my life and I’m not sure if it’s just normal to feel like this or if it is depression? 
I moved from England to Australia and have since been struggling with money and a career path. My dad passed away three months ago from a long battle of cancer. I feel guilty and angry every day for being here. I couldn’t afford to come home for the funeral. I have missed my sister giving birth, my brother getting married and being there for my mum to be here. 
I feel so angry towards life and it’s affecting my relationship and everyday life. I either feel crazy, emotional and generally just numb. 
My behaviour is also massively effecting my relationship with my boyfriend. I don’t have a sex drive and tbh I haven’t had one for years. Being intimate is the last thing on my mind. 
 I feel myself slipping back into a hole and everyday is now a struggle. I don’t want to go back on to medication because I want to feel free from depression but also they helped me before will they help me now ? 
Just after some advice please, do I go speak to a GP? Do I go back on medication ? Am I even depressed or is this just grieving ?

I really can't find a good reason why i should feel depressed. I had a good childhood with supportive parents, but I have struggled with anxiety and depression on and off throughout my life, and it has only gotten worse. Now that I have finished school and gotten a well-paying job that i can tolerate, I'm left with trying to figure out what to do with my life, and I'm really stumped. I really don't know what the point is. I have no friends. I have a good relationship with family but I hide behind a facade. I don't really have anything I'm good at, and there isn't really anything I'm passionate about. I just kind of take the path of least resistance because I have no sense of direction. I have this strong desire for something more, but i don't know how to satisfy it. I really dislike myself but don't know what to change, or who I would want to be. But most of all, I'm scared of death and want to live a meaningful life, but i don't even know if there is such a thing as an objectively meaningful life, or if that even matters. I don't have a clue where to start. Any suggestions on what I can do would be much appreciated. Thanks to everyone.

Hello, this is my first post I'm sorry if it is a bit confusing.
Just recently I got to know this girl from college, we started talking and hit it off, I really liked her and began flirting. It was around then that I found out my best friend also liked this girl quite a lot and knew her before I did. I discovered however that this girl liked me and not my friend, this made me happy but also sad that I had pretty much come in and stolen her from my friend. I decided to speak to my friend about this and my intentions with the girl, I was extremely anxious about doing this and had lost sleep thinking about it. However, I worked up the courage to talk to him about it and we sorted it out and he gave me peace of mind. Fast forward a couple of weeks, I now discover that I am having second thoughts about this girl, which frustrated me because I was so adamant that I liked this girl and there was a foreseeable future with her. I'm not sure now that I want to be with her now, which is stupid because I had just sorted it out with my friend. I am now wracking my brain on what to do, whether to break up or to keep going and hope that the more I get to know her the more I'll like her. At the moment, however, I am finding myself wanting to be alone more and more, sinking into video games and smoking weed to ignore the problems. I feel like I'm stuck at a crossroads where both situations no matter what I do make me in the wrong. I know the best option is to talk to her about it, but even the thought of looking at her with the intent to do so makes me sick. Talking about the situation now makes it seem, petty and childish and I should just man up and do what's right but every time I think of it I just want to stop existing all together. Sorry if that was a rant or it went off topic but I don't know how else to express what I am feeling.
Any opinion at all would be amazing help please and thank you.

I am feeling so lonely and depressed. I have been living with a depressed partner for 5 years and have lost the will to fight any longer. She is so nasty and hurtful. Nothing I can do is good enough.

Wasn't quite sure what to post but I'll just be honest. 
I am a socially awkward girl who has low self esteem and sleeps too much. I feel no motivation to do anything and when I do go out with friends I become anxious and depressed so I end up leaving early and as I drive myself home late at night I have an emotional breakdown in my car and start yelling at the top of my lungs until I calm myself down. Sometimes I wonder if my friends would even notice if I werenot there. 
I'd love to hear how others have stayed positive in tough times and what's a good way of feeling less alone?

For a while now I’ve felt like I’ve been dosing off into another world? Like just thoughts over take my mind. Sometimes staring at objects makes them feel really far away when I’m like this. 3 times now I’ve felt like I’ve been dreaming and that nothing was real. I don’t know what’s happening. I am diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. Don’t know if that has anything to do with it but I’m just confused and worried. It’s an uncomfortable feeling.

So here i am writing this trying to keep it all together. 
I suffered depression on and off since my teens. I am now 32. 
I have 2 young children, a husband and a father in law that lives with me. 
Ive noticed that my mental health is declining, i'm not happy, i'm disinterested in doing anything, 
I just want to sleep at the time, i can't be bothered attitude has set in and im isolating myself. 
I keep the family going, i have a special needs child, my husband works shiftwork i work shiftwork, 
I do all the household jobs and cooking etc and the child rearing. We support my elderly father in law as well, meals, cleaning, company/social. I'm exhausted i feel like i just want to run away from all the responsibility on my shoulders  
I'm seen as a very strong person and i generally keep it all together but im struggling and im going down. 
I'm scared im really scared that black cloud it almost over my head. I don't want it coming back but im feeling it. 
Mother guilt is setting in, being the one the holds the family together pressure is so much. All it is it work and children cooking and cleaning. No life pleasure's or events or holidays. Same day in day out nothing to look forward to :-(
Help! Maybe some advice on coping, what i can do, what i could change? 
Please note i have hardly any support and im not ready to open upto my husband.

Hey guys, only my second post here and I still don't really know how to start these but i'm doing what the person that replied to my first thread said and continuing to write on here. 
I've had a pretty rough couple of last weeks as i've just found out my father has lymphoma and his chances are pretty slim because he has a lot of other problems due to his liver and It's REALLY knocked me down.
I have never really had a good relationship with him, it has always been sort of awkward I really don't know why, we're both pretty socially awkward people though, i feel particularly worse because we've just never really got on well, a lot of arguing and just not a normal father son relationship. He's had a rough childhood too was adopted at a pretty young age.

I can truly say now that I know I've taken him for granted.. he does so much for me and my family, he's a full time carer for my mother who has Multiple sclerosis and he helps me with pretty much everything because i'm still 24 living at home unemployed with some pretty bad mental health.
He's in hospital at the moment, I've been visiting him and all I want to do is tell him how sorry I am for the way I've treated him and tell him all the good things about him and that I love him and everything he does for everyone but I cant really.. he's so out of it and tired and sick, It's absolutely breaking me and I feel like this will take me over the edge if he doesn't recover. I've tried talking to friends and family and it does help a little but the realization of losing my father when I come home and sit alone with my thoughts just makes me break down.

Hi, I'm a 22 year old female. I'm currently studying TAFE and working part-time as a Beauty/Massage Therapist. Both in a salon and Freelance.
This year has been personally difficult. I've had to give up my Arts degree due to heavy debts. My former retail job of 3 years closed down. I've lost 2 jobs within 6 months. I dealt with 6 months of bullying at a hair salon, which resulted in my abrupt resignation, and I'm still grieving from the loss of a friend of mine early this year. My family, already struggling financially, pressured me into doing this career because it's 'financially sustainable'.
I've since then tried my best to work to keep in money, along with something that would suit me. While many people have said I'm good at Massage, and it's not a bad job, I've also been struggling in it. Due to pressure and inexperience, I often come across as 'socially awkward', and end up offending clients. With my current boss adding more shift days to my schedule, along with TAFE it's becoming harder to cope with. I've had to cancel Freelance and in turn drop some clients out, some responding harshly. I've already received several bad reviews, both about me and the salons I've worked at. One of them firing me as a result.
It's ironic that I'm suffering at a 'wellbeing' job. I know I'm very lucky to be working in Beauty. Instead, I just can't help but feel utter resentment and depressed. Waking up to go to work can feel at times, dreading. Feeling isolated and lonely from the world, even alienated from my peers. Nearly every day I feel tired and drowsy, and it takes effort to fake a smile and 'act friendly'. I can't help but keep dwelling on the bad reviews, no matter how many people are satisfied with my work. At this point, I am simply looking for advice or support.
Thanks.

I’ve been feeling low & unsettled & detached & all these things on and off for probably a couple of years or more now. So far I only managed to tell one friend about it a couple of months ago and I instantly regretted it. Not for anything my friend did - she was great. I can’t explain why I regretted it but I did. 
I’m even engaged and my fiancé has no idea. 
 
I want sit down and cry and tell someone everything but the idea of going to the GP and even broaching the topic is just horrifyingly uncomfortable. Even once you get in to talk to a counsellor? The whole thing seems so clinical and not real. 
 
I never know if I’m happy with certain aspects of my life, is fear is holding me back from getting what I really want. But then I also think how do I know what I want? 
I’m beyond conflicted on how I feel about life. And I’m uncomfortably, comfortable feeling this way..if that even makes sense. 
 
What options do I have? 
How did you all start? 
What made you take a leap?

Its a no brainer really. Have read all the stuff, taken the quizzs and well i feel like crap all the time. Lost all motivation for everything, home, work sport. just cant be bothered. I have zero tolerance for people... all people, im binge eating or fasting and no sleep or to much and recently just burst into tears, at least twice a day, no trigger, no event, bam tears.... any way blah blah blah...see no brainer.
I cant deal with pros i go a bit silly, and i have a really hard time expressing how i feel. they care, i guess.... but to me all i see is fake and nongenuine. see straight through them. Number 35, your up, you have 30secs. right your done, $140 please...next.
To me isolation , being alone is bliss, but unatainable and so it seems it is also feeding into this.
Now im on a forum... but you dont know me and i can switch this off and go on my way, peeps none the wiser, so i guess its the security that is leading me this way to start with.
I know that see a doc / phys will be the intial comments and thx. maybe share with my partner will be another, as you can see i know the answers, im stubborn hey. But i cant bring myself to go to that space. Maybe its my percieved role in my space as a pillar of strength to mt family (then how can i be strong if i dont seek help and stay broken... see i see all that stuff as well)
Maybe over thinking, maybe looking for self assurance, who knows. i know i need help, im self destructing and it will end messed up. Im not suicidal. but it seems depression/anxiety maybe the culperate here.
Maybe typing today will help realise that i need to move forward in this space. I dont want comfort, or pity, or direction or ..... actually i dont know what i really want. maybe to vent, maybe to share, maybe to see my brain on paper and say to myself, your a scientist, you understand this stuff but yet you ignore it.....you idiot.
anyways, as you can see im new here, pretty messed up and on a tough road of discovery and awarness i spose.

At the end of my psychiatrist session yesterday he told me that I had emotionally unstable disorder (aka BPD)  and that he and my therapist have been working on it for a while. I’ve been with my therapist nearly 2 years, why is he only telling me this diagnosis now? (Already knew about anxiety and depression)

I'm so sick of my work
My personal life. 
Everything and I'm just in a foul mood. People laugh and I immediately feel rage. 
Shut. Up. It's not funny. Go away. I hate you! 
I just want to scream in their face. 
No coping strategy handles that.

This is going to sound bizarre. As a teenager I had a really strange period of time, like something out of a dream, where I thought the following things: that I was famous, that I was being watched by objects that had the thoughts of the outside world in them, and this was combined with elated/dreamy/moody feelings. In short, my sense of reality felt very warped. I kept being dragged down by feelings of emptiness and despair at being alive (depression), but also had really bizarre beliefs and feelings and behaviours. Also, hid my delusions because they felt so out-there, and I had a shift where it got so bad that I had to stop my delusions because it was getting out of control. During this time, I had weird mental hallucination kind of things where I saw flies that weren’t there, or heard a weird voice in my head once. But, since then, depression had been a recurring, big part of my life, as well as impulsive behaviours. I want to get perspective, and am trying to figure out how normal it is to have weird, implausible delusions.

Is anybody else experiencing drastic weight loss due to their depression? I never eat and when I want to I lose my appetite. My weight has changed majorly due to my depression and I’m so scared I’ll keep losing weight to the point it affects my health. Does anyone have some tips on how to eat when you’re not hungry? Or anything like that would be much appreciated:)

Hi guys, 
I have Bipolar 2 and have been well for quiet a while. Just came back from the best holiday but definitely burnt the candle at both ends. Yes there’s a trigger I’m well aware of. Sent me into a hyper manic party state that was heaps of fun at the time and even though I know better I just went with it. Right now, at 1.15 in the morning I’m dark as. That’s how I explain depression. So I’m reaching out, saying hi and taking full responsibility for where my mind is right now. I live a good life and know how to keep well. Alcohol and sleep deprivation are my biggest triggers and the 2 things I just went with for 10 days away. Not one of my better life choices. Well, I’m paying for it now. So I’m gonna take stock and sprinkle some selfcare on myself and remind myself that tomorrow is a new day. An exciting brighter day. 
Thanks for reading. Dani. x
Note to self - don’t drink alcohol and get a decent sleep. I should bloody know better!!

in my mind, im almost identical to my brother and i hate it. my brother is cool and all, but for so long i have put up this character of being a dominating person, which he is definitely not, and it feels so obscure and depressing to think that im not who i thought i was. i so badly dont want to be that. i start to cringe any time im around him and he does anything at all. 
i only noticed how alike i am to him last time i was smoking weed. were born about 9 years apart, and if you were to compare photos of us side by side the only differences would be his absurdly long hair and my progressive weight loss. i just stared at myself in the mirror and started to dissect how different i am to every single person i'm around. im a lot like my brother when im around my parents, especially my dad. i cant stand being like him when im around my friends, especially girls. i have to keep up the, what now feels like, an act. 
the thing is the act is different around every single person i am around. im going insane just interracting with people and closely judging myself from the inside, what i now think is the true central me.
i cant figure out who i am or how i truly feel or react to anything. i dont think im quite numb but it definitely feels like im headed that way. 
im popular, but have no real friends. i got to parties, but i dont hang out with people, not even in larger groups. my attitudes seem to be so inconsitent that i manage to push people away, or at least keep them on the edge of close friend and equentance to protect my self from people learning who i really am. i spend my time listening to music in my room, engaging in very long isolated exercise sessions, or staying up late to avoid contact with anyone. 
i just needed to tell someone. i could go through and make this easier to read, even make it more accurate to my experiences and thoughts, but whats the point.

Just recently quit my new job after only 2 months, I was made redundant before this that why I took this job in a hurry and the stress just keep piling up.
I can't handle the company expectations for this new job and my spouse want me to take break whilst I look for the next job. Never been unemployed before since 2005 and never had an annual leave since 2013.
Now I'm seriously depressed and doubting myself for making such decision on quitting my job. I am not confirdent that I will get another one quickly.

I'll summarise: 
• Suffering from depression for a few years now
• Managed with antidepressants
• Feeling numb, libido non-existent, questioning if the drugs are causing me to lack real joy also?
• Constantly tired
• Failed all units at UNI, dropped out as of this mid-year break - feel as though constant tiredness and lack of motivation is the main cause for this.
• Went off antidepressants cold-turkey about a month ago
• Withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, hypersomnia, vivid dreams, low mood, foggy head, etc.
• Sick of waiting for withdrawal symptoms to go away (I know it's not a good idea to quit cold-turkey and without medical advice - did it anyway cause I'm sick of feeling less-than-average). 
• Took antidepressants again for the first time in a month, tonight. Cant deal with the never-ending need for sleep, dizziness and brain so foggy sometimes I cant even formulate a single sentence. 
• Cant talk to loved ones about this because I know what I SHOULD be doing and what they would say/feel (and I dont want to burden them or make them feel like I'm a mess and cant look after myself). 

I just want to be normal and have normal emotions and be able to handle everyday things like UNI and work and the stuff that everyone else seems to get though, even though it can be a slog. I just want to feel like I can do normal things and be a functioning member of society. 

I dont know what to do. Exercise, meditate, seek help, spend time with friends, eat a good diet. I know that's what I'm SUPPOSED to do. I just dont have the energy or the willpower.

Hi, I'm dealing with a lot at the moment, but I don't know how to put it all down concisely.

I've followed the basic steps, booked in with my GP, been referred by the online chat here.

But all I really want is somewhere online to talk to someone, via text preferably. Is that a thing? Beyond being given FAQ , information and referrals, I mean. Just to try to articulate what's going on. No one in my personal life is available, and I'm really struggling to deal with things.
Betterhelp looks like a total scam, but that's the kinda thing I'm looking for.

It's getting increasingly harder to keep pushing through the pain I feel everyday. I have struggled with depression for 8 years and it feels like I'm just getting worse. My biggest problem is not being able to believe that people care about. I'm blessed to have so many good people around me who tell me they love me a lot. Somewhere deep down within me I know that's true. But most of the time I just can't see it. As a result I just have a sense of loneliness all the time. I am scared to reach out because I feel like I'm a massive burden to the people that would support me. I know many people feel like this so I am wondering for some ways others use to reject this feeling of worthlessness and inadequacy.

Hey I’ve just recently joined the group after looking for some advice. I’m a male that for the past 3-4 years I’ve been suffering from depression. When I’m down I’m really down and get stuck in rut which I can’t get out of for sometimes days and weeks on end. In the past, months have gone by when I wouldn’t eat or sleep or leave my room, but I thought I had finally got through this. Recently, I have started to experience some of these things again. Some days are really good, but some days are the worst I’ve ever been. My moods are never stable and I can feel myself taking it out on my girlfriend to the point where she gets really upset because I’m just so down. I feel like if I told her what I’m going through it might help her to understand a bit and make me feel a little better. But I feel like if I go out and tell her, I don’t want her to think that I’m making excuses or wanting sympathy or attention. I never really show my emotions so I struggle to speak about it.  I’ve never spoken to anyone about this, as I don’t want people feeing sorry for me. Has anyone had similar feelings? How have they gone about opening up?

Hi 
1st post. Just found this while googling for answers.
Im in my early 30's and diagnosed with serve anxeity and depression. Im married, with kids and quite successful. 
i currently get professional help from my gp and psychologist. 
lately i just feel empty and withdrawn. I feel so alone and feel like im going crazy. I dont feel i can talk to my family...when i say talk i mean the heavy stuff that is really on my mind. 
i wouldnt say im suicidal but some days i dont want to be here. Its quite hard to explain. I want to be here and wouldnt hurt myself, i just dont want to feel empty anymore. I guess if i could run away i probably would. I find it quite difficult to talk to people about how i really feel and what i am really going through. 
 i guess i figured maybe i would find people who possibly feel the same so i dont quite feel alone anymore. 
im starting to struggle and with being a mum wife and working full time the pressure is on not to breakdown or fall apart. Its hard really hard. 
I have been trying to work on myself for years now and i guess right now i feel like i have fallen right back to rock bottom with no way up. I am trying to recover the best i can but its hard when you feel alone. 
i can see the toll it takes on my family and that breaks my heart. 
i am looking forward to being apart of the online forum. I may not post alot but i feel maybe just reaching out and hearing other peoples posts i might not feel so alone in my battle.
Thank you 
Jacko

Unfortunately 2019 so far has gone very well, I got dumped by bf via text after dating 6 months i dont mind that it ended as the relationship wasnt working but it was hard being dumped via text, my sister then broke up with her boyfriend and shes been struggling with her depression, my dad just lost his job on friday as his employer cany afford to pay everyone unfortunately my dad had only been working there for 6 weeks so it was last in first out case so he will need to go back onto centrelink. My mum doesent work and does not want to work so this means that i am the only one in my household working again. Ive noticed over the past weeks that my depression has gotten bad again i feel stuck in a rut, useless, teary and ive been missing an ex boyfriend from 2 years ago (a break up that was horrible and i didnt handle well). I plan on calling my doctor on monday to schedule a appointment to go back on antidepressents as i feel like im struggling against the current. I do see a pyschologist and she gets back from a holiday on monday, and i go to a yoga class once a week so that im not just stuck in thd routine of go to work, go home repeat. But i just wish the things get bit better and toget through this depression and lonliness.

Hi everyone. I thought I would join Beyond Blue because Im really struggling at the moment and don't have any support networks around me. I'm 49yo single female, going through peri-menopause, my partner and I broke up 3 months ago because I was really struggling with symptoms of anxiety and was having difficulty making long-term commitment decisions with him, so I panicked and left him, I'm still struggling with that stupid decision because I did love him and he was the most wonderful man I've ever known, we were inseparable so being alone again is a real shock.. particularly at this age. I've struggled with a drug addiction for the last 5yrs, I initially started smoking 20yrs ago, self medicating for insomnia and over the past few years I've desperately been trying to give up but failing every time, it's made me completely antisocial but I just felt happier being away from people, but now I've realised how much it has affected my life, I don't want to smoke anymore, I don't want this solitary life, but I'm lonely so it night it stops me from going crazy with boredom at night, so I'm really struggling with the vicious cycle. I don't know how to get myself back to being social and meeting people. I'm very young at heart, never got married or had kids and I'm still renting (for which at my age I'm constantly being judged for) I find it difficult to make friends in my age group because I feel like I don't have anything in common with any of them and everybody already has their social groups. I'm seeing a psychologist, but I'm just really lonely, I'm not on medication because it's not really clinical depression, it's more situational due to loneliness, lifestyle factors (and hormonal) Today It's a beautiful sunny day outside and I'm lying on my bed crying wishing I had someone to go and hang out with, I really don't know how to make friends at this age, it's so difficult.

I'm new to this all so I am not quite sure what to say but any advice is welcome and I'm appreciative of it, I felt unhappy and alone for most of my life since my teenage years but lately it has been much worse. I feel like there is no hope, I'm exhausted all the time, alone, sad and I don't have a positive outlook on life despite my best efforts. A bit about me, I'm 21 year old and I'm almost done with university, I am the type of person to try very hard in all things I do. I get excellent grades and will hopefully have a good career in engineering, I work out and get lots of exercise but I am disappointing in my love life. I have never had a girlfriend before and have been told multiple times I'm not relationship material and that I'm not good looking, once by a girl who I had become friends with by helping her with the course work and I asked her out only to be rejected and made to feel inadequate because of my face. The thing is that I am quite slim and have a fit physique, but I just have a ugly face  and I'm not good enough for a relationship.  
I just get the feeling that those around me get the happy ending, my first found a guy she wants to be with, my friends are in happy multi-year relationships. I just want to feel accepted for who I am, someone to care about me and not overlook me for someone else, and someone to care and love me. I know that being in relationships doesn't automatically make you happy, however the feeling of not being good enough is horrible and I strongly believe is impacting me. I'm afraid to see what my life would be in 5 years time, alone, miserable and trying not to be bitter. I don't blame or hold anger towards the girls who rejected me or overlook me, I can only blame myself.
I cant turn to my family because my mother is insistent that I am incredibly good looking and every time she says that It really hurts knowing your mother is either lying to you are unable to see you for who you really are. Hence I'm here asking for advice.

I recently found myself becoming depressed and dissatisfied with my job. I was also dissatisfied with my home life. It then led to me having a sick day, then a 2nd day, then a whole week off. After that i decided to have a 2nd week off. (Not sure if I was just lazy or I really needed it). As I was casually employed the employer decided to let me go as they needed someone reliable. I was sorry about losing the job but felt i wasn't totally happy with it anyway. Before i started taking the time off I was just going through the motions at work, I would look at the clock all the time and just go through the motions. At the moment I am home but I have this restless feeling inside, yet when I try to get things done it takes me ages. I guess you could say I am bored at the moment.

Hi, like most people posting on here my life is in the pits. I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety around 10 years ago. 
 Since then, I’ve seen around 8 different psychologists, 2 psychiatrists, and have been on 7 different medications.
After getting all the tools and knowledge I need to understand my illness and what healthy ways of thinking look like, why can’t I change?
Little, insignificant things annoy the hell out of me in an unhealthy way. I am a sad, negative person to be around. I’m moody and angry at the world. I know all of this and I am disgusted in myself, yet despite all of that I can’t change. 
I’m stuck being this sad, miserable person. I see happy people all of the time and I would do anything to be like them and to see things in a different light.
All I see is the darkness and I’m about to lose my wife and kids because they don’t want to live like I do. 
What does it take to truly change? Taking a medication or seeing a psychologist to tell me what depression is for the 20th time isn’t working. 
Has anyone else been at this point where nothing works after so long? What did you do?

I am a teacher who is dealing with anxiety and depression from starting a new job a term ago. I came in with little handover at a busy time of the year. Each week something new is brought up which I am expected to learn. I have told my line manager that I am struggling and not sure where to prioritise my time and it has lead to little support. I feel worthless in my role and I am not having any joy for teaching anymore. I have been teaching for 10 years and this is the first time I have felt like this and it is worrying. I struggle to get up in the morning and spend most of my nights planning and trying to solve my issues with zero success. Each day is a stuggle to get through. I am seeing a councillor and have taken many mental health days where I have seen my doctor and he is at the point of prescribing anti depressants.
Today I had a meeting with my line manager and principal with the sole intention of expressing my thoughts and feelings and desire to give my two week notice. As predicted they tried to keep me by saying everything I have been doing is great and I am a  valued member.  Sadly I caved in my decision which  has made me feel worse that I have put their needs and the school needs ahead of my own mental health. The I am the second teacher already for the class this year as the first one left on maternity and I can understand they don't want to have to go through it again but I shouldn't worry about that as much as i should. I hate confrontation and fear I will always give in to what someone else wants instead of looking out for myself. 
 
They don't see how much I struggle at home and alone in the classroom. I know I am not doing the best job I can as I have lost that passion. I fear how dark some of my thoughts are getting. I wish for a reason to not go in like a sporting injury or someone hits my car. Nothing I am responsible for but it saves me from having to face my issues. I don't know what the answer is and almost need someone to be there and push me into it so I don't back out.

Hi everyone, I’m new to this so don’t really know what to even say, but basically I just want to be mentally healthy.
 Im 20 years old, I do have a boyfriend of two years who is supportive, but I feel like I’m being more of a burden rather than something good in his life, and I have only one friend left (who I never even see) , after the rest decided to get back out of my life after I lost my baby and the rut I spiralled in, I have no family aside from dad who isn’t supportive of anything, I am feeling lost and lonely and don’t know what to do.
I have no hobbies as I just can’t focus on anything or stay interested  (I’ve tried a lot) 
I have health issues which makes me in pain physically daily, which contributed to why I dropped out of my University course and quit my job as I couldn’t even go, I see no hope of even my life getting on track and currently am seeing a psychologist, it helps while I’m there but after I just forget about it all. 
I don’t know what to do anymore, I have been trying for the last two years but am starting to give up, nothing seems to be improving, everything I do feels like it’s a waste and for nothing, I was on medication and that barely helped, I feel like mentally I have given up

 It's been a very very bad week: taxes are due and I know I will owe a
huge amout to pay things off...I feel like an idiot, I am so lucky to
get money and I try so hard to save, but with rent, bills and groceries
it all added up...plus, I paid for a course and a holiday (not even a
really big one)... I started smoking again, after not smoking for years. I'm doing a vet nursing course that I really enjoy, with it I need to
work or volunteer at a real clinic to gain exerpience...since I'm too
old (here you have to be paid over a min wage after a certain age),
nobody wants to hire me as a beginner , so I only get volunteer
positions (it sucks so bad: I see younger nurses starting out the same
course, with no experience and I already have so much more to offer). 
Not to mention its an online course, and even though I keep up with
studying and work hard because I love it, the pratical side makes me so
nervous as I am only allowed to volunteer once a day (I already asked
for more days but they can't offer. I already changed over from another 2
clinics because one I wasn't even allowed to watch surgeries and wait 4
hours and do nothing, the other the manager told me she didn't want me
to do anything anymore because she wanted the work to be saved to train
the people she is newly hiring). Tomorrow I volunteer and so nervous
when they ask me to do practical stuff again and fail... 
I feel so lonely an frustrated, my partner is happy and comes home from
work and talks about his day, but its gotten to hte point he has had
enough of listening to me and doesn't know how to cheer me up (or he has
problems of his own getting used to night shift work again)... 
I have been trying so hard for the last few weeks to find a job,
nothing I am qualified for with just 2 years customer service experience
that not a younger, cheaper kid can do...and then I have a bachelor
degree of arts which I can't seem to get into with anything because my
art isn't good enough (I tried so hard getting into graphic design, I
just don't ""get"" the commercial side of things, the vector art...mine is
all hand drawn and ""messy""...)... I'm starting to loose hope. I prayed for the first time in years, wishing I could
finally find something i was good at and make a living out of, and that
my partner gets used to his night shift easily and keep up his good
health...I don't know what to do, I feel stuck.

I've really messed things up.
I have a major project at work that I have to complete in the next 4 weeks, but the truth is that it will be impossible for me to complete it.
For the 3 months I have found myself incapable of doing any work, I have turned up to work each day, and done the bare minimum, but have probably done less than 1 hour of work each day and have done almost no work on my project. 
My manager is interstate and thinks that I have things under control but I do not.
I've spent the last month in an absolute panic waiting for the moment when I get found out. I can't sleep, I'm beside myself all of the time, and when I'm at work I'm so overwhelmed by the outstanding work that I don't even know where to start.
I am applying for other jobs because I need to get out before they realise how badly I've messed up.

Hi,
I am new to the forums. I am feeling really down at the moment and don't really see a way forward. My job is really stressful and I have started to look for a new one but not sure I will be successful due to my current mind set. I just don't feel like doing anything and sleep a lot. Sometimes I feel so down that I am not sure I want to continue as life is very hard at the moment. Any guidance would be appreciated. Thanks.

hi all,
so i too wanted to mention that i suffer depression heavily and it affects me everyday! i don’t feel good enough or worthy of love and almost all the time i feel like i have no real purpose for life or have no idea what i’m doing. 
im alone and have no real friends or support around me and often deal with everything on my own, especially my depression! i cant seem to get it better and it just drags me down everyday. 
 
but yeah thanks for listening and i hope everyone else who’s struggling knows they’re not alone and it’ll be okay :)

Hey all I needed a place where I could safely share some of.my writing I have just wrote a new song/poem and wanted to share
HURT
 
Everyone’s problems are not mine to bear 
Everyone’s pain and guilt are not mine to take on 
I can’t help others if I can’t help myself 
Asking for help can be hard
Trust me I know first hand 

So much hurt so much pain
So much guilt ITS TO MUCH TO TAKE
I need to let go 
I need to be free 
This big heart of mine needs to beat free and for me

Not knowing where to go or look 
Not knowing what doors to open or closed 
So I asked you 
Let me help me before I help you 

So much hurt so much pain
So much guilt ITS TO MUCH TO TAKE
I need to let go 
I need to be free 
This big heart of mine needs to beat free and for me

One day the pain will become too much to bear
 And you want it all to be over and end
Trust me I get that I’ve been there and done that 
It just passes to all the people who love and care

So much hurt so much pain
So much guilt ITS TO MUCH TO TAKE
I need to let go 
I need to be free 
This big heart of mine needs to beat free and for me

You might feel like it’s all over 
And there’s nothing left to live for 
Look inside you deep inside you 
And you will see you
Trust me thats enough to live for

So much hurt so much pain
So much guilt ITS TO MUCH TO TAKE
I need to let go 
I need to be free 
This big heart of mine needs to beat free and for me

The Good - crazy good feelings, like a sunny day in the middle of winter and The Beach Boys song - Do It Again, comes on the car radio and BOOM, I turn it up my whole body is beaming and Im wearing a great big scary smile and Im animated singing and then I realise that no one else in the car is on my fantastic bipolar wave length.
The Bad - medication cocktails and owning both a fat and a thin waredrobe and actually preferring the type and style of clothes available for bigger people.
The Ugly - being arrested for mistaking my birthday suit for my boiler suit, as euphoric as I was I thought the public photographing me were fans who had come to greet me.

Hi everyone, I am new to Beyond Blue.  I am 42 and have been living with depression for many years. I had an acute episode of post-natal depression after my first child was born which was not diagnosed until I was having some pretty scary symptoms and as a result I sought help and was diagnosed with mental illness for the first time.  The doctors then put me on medication which settled things down but it's been a roller-coaster ever since.  Eventually about 8 years ago I was finally diagnosed with dysthymia and it appears that in reality I have suffered depression since my early teens.  My mother says it all makes sense now!  LOL. I come from a very good family but emotionally my parents were always a little 'vacant' growing up.   I have been on and off anti-depressants since that first acute episode and have now come to grips with the fact I will be on meds forever.  Felt like a failure for so long and have had a big battle with myself over that! 
 
Rationally, when I look at my life as if someone else is looking in, my life is pretty good;  re-married to a great supportive man who I love deeply, four children between us, good job etc.. it just all still feels like a struggle.  At times I feel like I'm going to break apart.  I have this feeling that if I let even the smallest amount of emotion out, then it will overwhelm me and there'll be no putting it back in.  I feel like I'm holding back a huge tide.  I tell myself to get control and breathe because if I let it go, 
I'm afraid I won't be able to get back to myself. 
Does anyone have these same feelings??

I am currently struggling in life, admittedly I have been very careless with my finances. I have never been unemployed ever since 2005 then I have been retrenched recently and found a job almost immediately, however the job proves to be beyond my capability. I am in everyday struggle and in constant state of anxiety. I want to quit and find a more suitable job however all the work I applied didn't contact me back. 
 
The thought of being in another job interview gives me severe anxiety attacks. and I can't afford to be jobless :(.  I'm running out of hope and options.

How do you cope with symptoms that just hang around? They used to come and go and I'd feel not too bad. I have been working through a lot of issues with my psychologist, so maybe that is why they seem so persistent. Maybe I'm actually dealing with them ? I try to do mindfulness and breathing techniques but even this is hard at the moment. I seem quite agitated and I am so tired I just want to lie down. At a medication review by 2 different psychiatrists I have been told my depression and anxiety are due to my environment, my husband and mother in law, so I have been trying to be assertive and speak up in order to get my needs met, but this isnt really working. I'm told it is my issue, get over it or I hang onto things, things have been like this for years, but I feel I have got to the point where I have nothing left to give. I think about if I left and it feels like a weight is lifting. I just don't know how much more work I can do on trying to be assertive with my husband, mid June it worried me so much that my psychologist and I discussed not looking at the issue for 3 mths, but this hasn't settled me very well, it is constantly on my mind. Deep down I feel nothing is going to change, my marriage is my husband and I and his mother. Maybe I need to address this sooner and talk to my psychologist . I think the thought that I am keeping myself the way I am by staying in my marriage has got to me as well & it is making me feel down. It is hard as I have no family support and a son I need to consider. What if I leave and I make a mistake? To me my marriage was everything good and bad, I've done a lot of giving for 15 yrs and had to support myself with my depression and anxiety, pretend everything was good when I have been unwell. I am confused, overwhelmed and just want things to settle so I can think straight.

For the last few years i have been battling with depression and anxiety problem which have had in impact on me, For a long time i let it run me but after seeking help i managed to get it under control at the start of this year 
I enjoy cycling which was a good outlet , punishing my body making me feel something else 
The biggest thing was my job history , have scattered employment of only casual work , a few months here and a few months there . I felt useless a burden to society( useless good for nothing dole bludger , get a job ya lazy bastard)
I got some employment in a company which i thought was going to be a long term thing going by their promises , in this time i had my two dogs pass away , one i had to put down due to a tumor the other had a bad heart , they were 14 and 16 so had a good life , but they were my rock i came home to them they were always there to greet me 
a few weeks ago i lost my job due to a downturn in work , me and 15others got put off , i thought great here we go again , i should be used to it by now , but now came the hurdles of trying to get back onto newstart , which i am still waiting for payments. I was gutted  a massive kick in the guts 
My dad has been suffering with a lot of health problems for a number of years , over the last 18months he was in hospital more frequently, this year he went into hospital in June and never came out , he died a week ago , the last 3 weeks of his life he was in a nursing home 
a friend of mine who said they were my best friend , wasn't really too concerned , all she cared about was whether i could feed her cats while she went away for the weekend 

I am trying to stay strong for my mum , I don't want her seeing my breaking , my brother and sister live 2 hours away 

The other night i went out for a ride on the bike , as in bicycle , I was ready to break down the only thing that kept me grounded was that i came across a pack of kangaroos

To start, I havent been professionally diagnosed with anything, but I strongly suspect that I have major depression + anxiety disorder. The main problem I have is that I feel unable to seek help for these problems, and I feel like I have to explain what it is like experiencing mental illness in the military. 
Mental illness is incredibly stigmatised in the military. I’ve been in the navy for about 4 years, and while we are given briefs from senior officers about mental health services that are available and what to do if your experience a mental health crisis, in my experience the military “talk the talk” but don’t “walk the walk”. The majority of psychologists they hire are organisational psychs, not clinical psychs, which is something they don’t advertise. I have been to military psychologists, sometimes by my own volition, and other times I’ve been ordered to by superiors.  Both experiences resulted in me feeling incredibly judged and paranoid and like I’d been tricked. The worst part is that I every time I have sought help I have felt like my job was at stake. And so now I don’t see how I can seek help without sacrificing my income and the way I live. if you do nominate yourself in the military as someone with mental health issues, you also automatically get posted  to a unit with literally zero job satisfaction. You are “non deployable”, even if you experience something as simple as just having to take a pill once per day, which is what I suspect I have, a hereditary illness. 
I have wanted to join the navy since I was 14. I have served overseas, I have spent 2 years posted to a warship, I have sacrificed months of my life away from home, sacrificed familial and friend relationships, sacrificed a romantic life, in order to serve and protect. And yet I am utterly alone. I have no one. no one who understands or cares, that I find it hard enough to function each day without wanting to die. I want help, but it’s so stigmatised, particularly in the junior sailor community, that I feel utterly stuck, lost and helpless.

Hi I don't even know where to start first, I have suffered depression and anxiety before many years ago, in my early 20's, I'm not sure how much to mention or not to mention so I will try not to go into too much detail here. I've been single for along time, and I am mostly OK with that, but sometimes its nice to have that partner to talk to. I have a great family but I feel like I burden them by lumping this on them. In the past few months issues about my weight, health problems, and other life issues have all just snowballed and without realising it, it hit me all at once, and now I just feel abit not overwhelmed, just flat and I know it will get better, I tell myself that, like last I felt depressed, I cried it out, I felt it all, and then I started to feel better, almost like myself, until it happened again, so this time I wanted to reach out maybe just to get it out of me and share it, I hope soon I can start to feel better . Ok that's it for now.

I was doing better; even though work was hell, I’d push through the day and focus on the positives. But this week is perhaps the worst I have ever had to deal with. 
This job has been turbulent from the start (November 2018), I went on 2 week stress leave due to work place bullying that my TL had said they’d resolve. That was in March. It is now July and it keeps happening. On my birthday, I got stood down from work due to a complaint from my bully, without hearing my side. (I still don’t know the incident I’m trying to defend myself of.)
I’m still trying to process this situation, but it’s really thrown me back into that dark place I spent ages trying to drag myself out of. 
Is there something so wrong with me that I deserve the hatred and ire of another person? Because they’re making it easy to hate/despise myself.
I know I shouldn’t, as the wonderful BeyondBlue Support Member I spoke to today had said, but it’s so hard when I’ve had to deal with this since I started this job. The work environment is so hostile, that 8 hours a day, I don’t get spoken too by any of my team members. At all.  Not even for work purposes. A lot of people have told me, maybe I should just do my job and not worry about them, keep my chin up and brush off their comments and attitudes. I try, but it weighs heavily after a while of the same atmosphere day in and day out.
the worse thing is, my TL said that they understand, as they’ve been in a similar situation- and then ignores or treats me like an idiot like everyone else. I have previously said to my TL that I was thinking of resigning because of my bully - and they came back with how much of a valuable team member I was and how everyone enjoys working with me, that my ideas are welcoming. But I don’t see that. Ever.
I have a psychologist appointment tomorrow - hopefully I can stop crying and get over it.
i just. I’ve had to pretend to my family that I’m not falling apart. I know they’re supportive and want to help - but, I feel myself shut down and pretend it’s all okay. And it’s not. 
Its not.

Trying to do life with a broken emotional thermostat, where every feeling is magnified - it is extremely difficult. I understand now exactly where my Bipolar Disorder originated. Family history. I tackled my 20's by riding the moods & the rapid cycling with substance abuse & gambling. Isn't that normal? Truth was I was suffering & it held me back. My relationships were reflective of my illness & I never..ever let anyone close. The intoxicated me was everyone's best mate then I'd lie in bed for days at a time. So I continue this manic way of life & meet a woman that saw something in me, behind the my erratic behaviour. Happily ever after? Nope. After 5 yrs of marriage & a child I did improve alot but I still battled everyday to keep my head above water. We moved states, I thought a 'fresh start' would help me. I was wrong. The isolation & loneliness was detrimental & along with life pressures I regressed. I gave up. The 13-14 period I lost it. Alcohol abuse, porn addiction, rampant gambling & very grandiose behaviour. I was out of control & also out of the family home. I saw a doctor for the 1st time during this period. I sat and I cried for the whole appt. Broken. As it turned out it took some months of medication changes to land @ Bipolar. It was during this period I gave up. I $30K lost on a 2 day bender. Most would say, what an idiot. But inside my world at that time I didn't care if I lived to see the next day. And that is exactly what happened, I texted my estranged wife to say sorry, ready to end my life. Someone called the police & i was coaxed not to & taken to hospital. I got out after 3 weeks & on day 1 out I tried again. Another month in hospital followed by another month. Time changed me. I kept therapy going, I started to make small changes & looked after my sleep. Accepted & embraced my illness & my treatment plan. Got my family back!! I don't forget the feeling of the policeman talking to me in the back of the ambulance...telling me i can recycle my pain & make it work for me, don't give up & make sure your daughter has a Daddy. I'll never see him again, wouldn't know him if I ran into him - but thank you, i'll never forget. I write this to remind people they aren't alone & to also to encourage others that it is ok to have a voice, don't be ashamed. Also that I am as normal as the next person! Get help early, if you think something is wrong get to a doc. Love yourself. You're so worth it

Ok, people look at me and see a well put together person who knows how to live life. I am intelligent, augmentative and imaginative. I help people all the time budgeting, planning and generally make there lives better. But no matter how much i help other people i still feel empty, i still feel like i am hiding. I am always thinking ""does this response make me look like an asshole"". I'm always making sure i look good in others eyes. I suffer from anxiety as well which makes it harder. Always looking for others approval at work which makes me look weak. Even though im very large(im 186cm and 120kg).
 I've found the only time i feel normal and happy is when im drinking alcohol and I only drink on a friday night but i would rather feel great all the time. Is this a normal thing?
I have tried Anti-Depressants and they all make me feel worse, but i guess I have only tired 3 of them, but i Hate drugs to begin with. 
I feel like I am rambling with no real point but i seems to be helping me. Thanks all I hope your having a good day :D.

Hello everybody
This might be a long post but this might be the only place where I can talk about my thoughts.
I feel so lost and so lonely. I feel lost in my life, my work,my family. I am so unhappy and I feel guilty for feeling unhappy. I have three amazing children that I am so proud of, but for the last year/year and a half I have been feeling so sad and unhappy. I wonder why I am here, what have done to make my presence here worth it. I am 38 this year, and I hate that I feel as I have wasted my life away and sometimes I say to myself: what is wrong with you, you acting as if you are 80 not 38, get up, harden up and do something that will make you feel worthy? But that's not happening. I start something and not long after that it goes down because I cant see the point of it anymore. I don't know even how to write whats inside my head right now. I have changed so much over the last 5-6 years. I have become so different than my husband that now I dont know what we are to each other anymore. I have started to resent what he says, what he does, we cant seem to agree on anything and its making me angry . And on the end all of this is making me guilty for feelining any of it. Two years ago I ended up in hospital with subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a aneurysm and every day I wish I didn't wake up from it. Finding out that when I went into surgery my husband when home was like a trigger that has taking me to this dark place that I cant get out from. I mean what person that tells you he loves you and that you are the most important thing for him, goes home when you go into a life threatening surgery because it was gonna take hours. I am hurt. On top of that he didn't even see how much that upset me when we spoke about it.
I can't write anymore, I am at work and I have started to cry and it will not look good with the customers.

I am 22 years old, and have always been ambitious. I've also been struggling with panic attacks and crippling bouts of depression since I was 9, however lately the depression seems so much more pervasive.

Lately I've just had this really nagging sense of being a failure and a disappointment to others and largely to myself, I quit a job that made me very stressed and unhappy only to have the same feelings at the new job I'm at - I've already found myself taking ""sick"" days when I just can't get myself to stop crying and get out of bed, which of course just makes me feel worse and exacerbates my suspicions that I am in general a disappointment and burden. The job itself is less stress and the coworkers are lovely people, but I count every minute and am constantly struck with hopelessness and rushes of fear pertaining to my longstanding hypochondria (the past 6 months it has been fear of brain tumour despite having a clear MRI seven months ago).
I have been constantly referring to my former aspirations, and almost lamenting my capabilities as they grew to nothing and I've not achieved anything that I am proud of. I also emigrated to Australia from Europe 4 years ago and have yet to form any friendships or relationships, which has been unbelievably embarrassing. 

Everyday is so awful, and I miss the times in my life where I could just breathe and not constantly feel as if I am working to survive and ""get through"" - thank you to anyone who read for listening.

Hi there,
I am new to this forum. 
I don't know where to start. Recently I have been overwhelmed by depression and anxiety. I have just come out of a very stressful job into a new job. Even though this job is much less demanding, I'm having a very hard time adjusting. I'm not feeling myself. I feel so empty and alone. I feel like I have no one to turn to, and that even if I did, no one would care. I feel alone around friends and family, and even when I am with my partner. I can't talk to anyone. At the start of the year I was so happy, and had so many things to look forward to. Now I feel like everything is an effort and there is no point in even leaving my room. I don't recognise myself anymore and it scares me.
How do you cope with these feelings when they get too much?
Thanks.

I am trying to see the funny side in my current situation and I'm finding it easier to write my thoughts down on the computer then when I'm talking to people face to face , dueto depression on its own and probably the colder weather, my brain feels like cement, brain fog some people call it but this feels more like a cement that makes having the patience to deal with getting a better phone deal an issue hah so I just gave up , I think thats what everyone has do when depressed or just frazzled just give some of your daily goals up because sometimes your brain has maxxed out hah. Anyways I am looking to start a new medication that will hopefully help with the cement until I have a magnetic brain treatment in a few months, I'm not allowed to mention treatments here yes ? Anyways would love to hear from other people who feel like they have cement in their brain , we will hopefully all get back to clarity.

Hello,
My friend is 24 years old and suffering from depression. She is not interested in looking at any websites that have information after information of writing and is written in professional and distancing type of language. I was looking at what websites to recommend her and came across BeyondBlue and YouthBeyondBlue. I know that youthbeyondblue is recommended for young people up to 25 years old. but my friend is pretty much around this age. So would you recommend her looking at the youthbeyondblue website or the beyondblue website? What makes these two websites different? Is the information/content different or are they basically the same, but written in a more adult friendly way whereas the other website is written in a way that young adults would relate more to? I just wanted advice on this before bombarding her with too many websites which may dissuade her from trying to get better with her depression. Thank you so much.

Well where do i start... cliche
I am here again which means im depressed again. Smoking and drinking every night.
I left oz to come to Africa to fix my depression to join my family. I then got a lot better and moved onto bigger things.
I spent a year in spain working as a teacher and had a great time.
However my time was cut short as i was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Which turns out one of the symptoms is depression.
Apparently i have had this for a few years and one of the major symptoms arose and gave me double vision and blurry vision. Went for treatment and had it corrected but i am now taking 5 pills every morning and night to fight the symptoms.
Since i have come back to Africa and currently living in Zambia.
6 weeks later my father passed away at the age of 55 turning 56 in a couple months time... he had no prior medical issues and was the healthiest man i knew.
Now i am completely lost for words as i don't know what to do with my life.
We are currently deciding on returning back to oz and i have no idea what is there for me and for our future.
I spend nights awake until 2am and hoping my dad will walk through those doors in the morning, telling us that this is all a horrible joke to see how we would react.
But i know that he isnt coming back anymore because i watched him die on the golf course and when the doctors asked me to stop performing cpr as there is no hope.
I watched his arm fall off the bed lifeless in slowmotion. And its the only image in my head i see when i think of him. That and his smile 5 minutes before he had his heart attack.
I constantly think of how the doctor's could have done more. As i watch so many mesical shows. They could have used a defibrillator or maybe put him into a coma and solved the problem in SouthAfrica.
But we were 200km from the airport and that was just impossible.
I hate this country so much. It took my father from me and nearly killed my sister from poor doctors opinions.
He was a true Australian
Such a good man that helped people everyday. Life is not fair.
now i am supporting my family and trying to hold back the tears every day.
Cheers for reading

I’ve only been on this earth for 19, nearly 20 y years. But with out a doubt, 2019 has been the worst year of my life. I’ve never been so depressed. I literally have no direction in life, no passions, no interests and I can’t help but compare my life to my friends and people around me. 
The start of the year I was so happy, I went overseas met family members I didn’t even know existed had the time of my life. Was about to start my first year at uni when I got back. When I got back I had an overwhelming anxiety  and ended up dropping out of uni after the first week.  I couldn’t commit to it, as I didn’t know if it was the right path and I really wanted to be at uni to make my parents proud and I know going to uni will give me a better life. 
After a gap year and then the following year (2019), dropping out I felt and still feel like a disappointment and failure. I can’t help it. I visited a GP (not my usual one, just a random clinic) told her about my concerns and I just didn’t connect with her she referred me to see a psychiatrist but I didn’t go. 
For the past month, I’ve been trying to help myself with researching courses, degrees etc for next year because I really do want to study, but I have no idea what to study. But everything I read I either 100% don’t like it or if I have the slightest interest in it I over research it and read all the negatives of the chosen career and then completely disregard it. 
My heart just feels so heavy and broken and each day is so hard to deal with. Even going to work is such a struggle now my boss wants me to start closing the store and I just don’t want to. I don’t feel capable or confident enough to do it but I don’t have a choice because it’s my only income and I’m only 19. 
 
Life right now just really sucks and my biggest issue is  my lack of belief in myself  and lack of interest with life. I honestly don’t see any hope anymore with anything and it’s just so sad because I was such a happy girl and had the world in my hands and now I’m just broken and lost all faith in life.

Hi, for years I dealt with the sadness and feelings of worthlessness as just that, I was weak and just get over it. It wasn't until 2015 or a bit before when I was formally diagnosed as ""Depressed"" (Im turning 40 this year). From there it has been a trial of medications until we thought we got it right. That is until now when my recent visit to Psychiatrist had him revisiting his theory to question ""Mania"". Long story short I hadn't been able to see this psychiatrist again till now, so more than 3 years later. First step now is to wean off the medication now that he believes has been basically a toxin to me and making me and my condition worse. I see him again next week for the next step, but basically now we need to delve into a new diagnosis of possible Bipolar. I honestly just feel so weird about it. Excited that I might be able to fix myself ""again"" but so nervous at such a confronting ""disease/illness"". How did you deal with a new diagnosis?

After six years working for a social housing firm, I have been advised last week that my position is made redundant.  I was not consulted about this and following week they have taken my user access to the computer.  I work remotely from home so I contacted my supervisor via text message.  She advised me that they are giving me this week off to find work so login has been suspended.  So having  a positive approach, I have commenced applying for jobs during the time, but I cannot believe how they are treating me.  To add to that, my supervisor advised me to keep the matter hush, hush!  
I have given my heart and soul to the organisation and I was the person responsible for transitioning the office from paper based to and electronic environment, trained staff, wrote business policies and procedures for management and even visited our remote offices and made lunches for staff members.  Actually my general manager had a military background and he strongly believed in having meals together as a troop.  Lucky for my limited cooking skills and access to a stove in the kitchen, I was able to knock out something for the staff.   I feel disappointed on my bosses not to involve me in the process, let alone advise staff of possible restructure / job losses for staff. 
I feel let down by my boss but I place my trust in God that he will help me.  I have a million dollor loan on my head and my wife works part-time to take care of our two girls.
I feel unvalued as my bosses did not consult me. A letter outlining redundancy did not reflect on my performance, but lack of funding from Government office, but still I feel staff should have been notified.  No doubt the managers knew how they were performing and that a lack of performance on their part would put the company's prospects at risk.    From where I stood, I continued to give my 110% to my work commitments and assisted staff where possible.  
I never envisaged that I would be treated this way by the organisation I helped so much.  I think staff loyality is not longer prevalent in society today.  The days of staying in a job until you retired are long gone!  Any advise you can suggest please!!

I'm just wondering how everyone else deals with their depression when it strikes hard.
I personally really struggle, because when depression strikes I tend to want to get worse instead of better. I'm not really sure why this is, but it makes it even harder to motivate myself to start working on the self-care stuff. I see a psych, I have loads of things I can do to help (exercise, meditate, read little midfulness tips, activities I find relaxing, talk to my friends, eat healthy and drink plenty of water etc) but I find myself getting stuck below these things. It gets so bad that I can barely get up to get to work on time, and then I spend the drive to work fighting the urge to turn around or do something that means I don't have to go to work.
So I'm wondering if anyone else experiences similar things? And what you do to combat them. Does anyone else find themselves making themselves worse instead of better? Do you take time off work? I never know if I should be taking some time off and resting/recovering, or if I'm supposed to push through when times get like this. I continue seeing my psych, but there's only so much we can cover in one session, and there's only so many sessions I can afford.

Hey guys, just more here to gather some advice or personal experiences on how to deal with the fatigue during a low episode with bipolar.
Not sure if many of you experience anything similar, but its almost like where your body aches so bad its like you had a flu, and your neck, shoulders, and your whole body really become stiff and sore, and you just sleep and sleep and sleep, and you loose motivation to do anything including cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc etc

Ive tried having baths, and excersising as much as i can to try like combat the feeling of no energy but its really hard when your body aches so bad. Im also diagnosed with adhd, so i take medication everyday, and usually this helps me focus and become a little more energised, but whilst this episode is happening, its like it doesnt even work...

Have any of you found ways to combat this? Or is it more just a ride the wave and wait till it hits the shore kind of thing?

Hi I'm new here. I went off antidepressants last year after 25 years. There is a long story behind this which I won't go into. I've been ill for most of this year and whether this was due to coming off antidepressants is undecided. No cause has been found after extensive tests. Im physically better but have become quite depressed to the point where I just want to stay in bed all day. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and am back on medication. Ive only been on the full dose for 2 weeks and also on some anxiety medication. I care for an adult daughter with a disability and my life has to work around this. Up until early this year I seemed to have a relatively happy life but I've completely lost the threads of that life. I feel empty and despairing. My question is this: at this stage do I force myself to do things like go for a walk etc?  I've lost all motivation and I'm terrified I will feel like this forever. I don't seem to be able to feel any happiness at all at the moment. I live with my husband and 2 young adult children. My husbands been great but he has to work. Any feedback greatly appreciated. Thank you.

So I'm 44, ugly, weird... the kinda guy you see on public transport and are immediately  uncomfortable around. When i'm introduced to people i can read the expression on their face they don't like what they see by the forced smile accompanied by a subtle, slightly uncontrollable snarl from the upper lip.
In the workplace i have no hope of ever getting a high position. women don't want to be anywhere near me. Men don't either.
Apparently I'm depressed? What if I'm not depressed? What If I'm just hyper perceptive? What If i can see clearly that I'm being judged by my appearance.
Perhaps you are like me. Do you think a pill will make it all go away? chatting with a shrink will make it all better?...It won't change a thing.
I've tried.

 I've made so many mistakes in my life. I feel so depressed about it. No matter what i'm doing i'm always thinking about it. I know there are so many people in worse positions than me but it doesn't make me feel better. I literally feel like killing myself all the time. I've gone to the GP and seen a psychologist, it helps but i can only see him every few weeks. 
 
I'm 25.  Wasted my education, been fired from jobs, i can't even get a proper job now. I didn't make any friends in the last 4 years. No one wants to talk to me or hang out with me. My hair has receded and i've gotten ugly. I met a girl online a year ago and went out with her for 7 months. It made me feel so good but now she has gone and she won't be coming back. I've gambled away all the money i've earned. I have about 500 in savings whilst my friends and people on instagram are buying houses. I spend my time and money going to brothels because i'm lonely. Hell, i've even made friends with some of the ladies and sometimes just go to talk to someone adn talk to a girl. I want to go back in time so bad. What the hell happened? Where did it go wrong? I want to end it so badly.I don't see it getting better too.

For those who have seen my previous threads, I've been told a lot to talk to a GP and things like that.
I've done the K10 test and it told me to aswell (I scored high)
But that doesn't feel like an option to me...
Does anyone have alternative ways of coping? I do sometimes use the kids help line webchat, and I'm thinking I should use it more regularly.

Hey guys, I'm 25 years old and I have a amazing 7 year old son. My whole life I have been through these waves of stages where I am not motivated, constantly tired, nothing humours me and I just feel emotionless. Then some great days I have a surge of motivation and I'm happy, excitable and want to talk more, will cook and clean etc.  I am in a job where I am a leader in the business and I'm struggling to be motivated for work and find many days I have my happy/fake face on to tackle the day and by the end of the day I'm exhausted and my wall is back up again, my partner thinks I show no interest in him when really I feel like my body become unable to produce happy emotions, I'd rather just lie down and be silent. I am always tired, like I mean I wake up and I need to go back to bed again. I just don't know what is happening to me, I want to be happy but it is as if my brain will not let me. I have hardly no friends and I hate socialising because it makes me anxious and when I am able to socialise it feels like it is so hard to think of things to say. 
I hope this makes sense to anyone who is reading. I'm typing this now as I feel like this. Any advice would be amazing.

Hi , I’m new to the forum and I don’t really know how to start. For the last few years I’ve been feeling lost and not like myself - completely lonely and isolated.
Recently I opened up to my family and my partner about it and said I needed help , that I was deeply depressed and had no will to do anything , always exhausted and have no energy or confidence anymore. Their responses were that I’m lazy , making excuses and/or making up stories to get attention and they don’t believe how I’m feeling. Most have now stopped contact with me and my partner is threatening to leave if I don’t do something about it. This has just made me feel worse and completely lonely now , sad to say I don’t have one friend I could talk to about it. 
I feel like I hardly function now, 3-4 years ago I was this ambitious , outgoing and healthy girl and now I don’t feel like myself anymore. I haven’t had a restful sleep for years and have no energy , everything is an effort. I’ve gained a lot of weight, have crippling anxiety and extreme mood swings , I’m scared to talk to people , I cry constanly , have no job and always feel sick ,among other things. 
ive been to multiple doctors and psychologists about it , being diagnosed from clinical depression to borderline personality disorders , taking multiple antidepressants and been to the hospital a number of times and I feel like I’m just getting worse. I’m really scared and need help.

I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and found out mine is genetic and environmental due to my family having all different mental health issues throughout generations.  I have a fear of rejection, no self worth, unstable sense of self,  anxiety, I tend to like people then devaluate them when they do 3 or more things that I consider to be bad,  I can not  handle any type of criticism,i have trouble maintaining friendships yet I can maintain my relationship with my partner, im always looking for validation from others, I tend to dissociate when under servere stress, I have memory lapses, I hallucinate when my anxiety goes through the roof and I have black and white thinking. Because of all this I have trouble coping in work environments and I had to quit my job. I was recently given exercises by a therapist to help me cope with my emotions and anxiety which has been helping but I  fear that if I get a job and am subjected to so much stress that my bpd will get out of control again.  Is there anyone else with bpd that has successfully held down a job and if so how do you cope with work related stress?

I’ve been struggling with depression for a rather lengthy extended period, and found that my coping mechanism is to lock myself away and not act as a functional human being. 
I’ve never really known any other way of dealing with my issues, but I know that it’s not healthy and can’t continue on, as it’s making the problem worse. I have ADHD on top of (what I assume to be as of yet) clinical depression, and it’s very hard to stay motivated to keep on going. 
If you have a suggestion, please let me know! I’d appreciate it to no end.

My wife has shown little affection to me over the last 10 years or more. She says she isn't a cuddly person but will say she loves me when asked. I feel I need to harden up and accept that I don't get much love, but it has worn me down, I am considered a blokes bloke, but I secretly crave affection. Anyone else in the same boat? I love my wife dearly.

Hi everyone, new to this kind of thing.
i have struggled with depression, anxiety for a few years now. This year it’s to be apparent that it is the worst it has ever been. I have taken 4 weeks off my stressful job to sort myself out. I see a psychiatrist once a week and she is great. Honesty I just want to spend all my time in bed. I have three kids who are old enough to organise themselves for school, however I feel I am not enjoying them or life at all right now. I take medication and I see my doctor frequently, i have a husband who doesn’t understand and is stressed over money since I’m not working. I don’t know what to do? Sometimes it takes all my strength t leave the house. I never used to be this person I was happy, bubbly, vivacious and loved people. Now I just want to hide..... does anyone else feel this way? What do I do????

Hello everyone. I am 21 years old and have recently been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I've known for quite a while that something wasn't right and I suffer from anxiety and depression. I feel as though I can function in a job, I can study and I can have great friendships but the moment I meet a male and get attached to him these things all suffer. I always feel as though they are going to leave, I always question them thinking something is wrong when it probably isn't. I get with them way to quickly just because I have it in my head that maybe they'll stay. It takes me a while to recover from this and I am deeply knocked by it. I just wanted to know if there was anyone out there around my age who has this disorder? or is there anyone out there with BPD that managed to maintain a relationship, to get engaged and get married or have children? because that is my biggest fear. I am able to meet males and maybe go on 2 or 3 dates but soon enough I get attached and its like I purposely wreck it, I overthink and I always assume that they'll either leave or get with someone else. I can be impulsive in the way I text them constantly and I hate that about me. I have recently gone to a psychologist who recommended dialectical behavioural therapy. I want to do it as I feel it'll help me but it is so expensive that I am unable to do it. Is there anyone out there that have done some sort of therapy that has worked or even improved your mental illness that isn't so expensive? I'm at a loss

I have previously been diagnosed with general and social anxiety disorder as well as depression. Overall, I think I deal with it okay, though I don't necessarily feel I have any particular strategies. 
At the moment, my partner and I saving for a house, planning for our wedding in six months time etc. I've invested most of my effort into pursuing these goals. As a result, we limit our time out, because we are saving.
My aunt who I was close to recently passed away. However, I feel somewhat numb to that, as if didn't really happen to me/her. 
The part I'm really confused about is how stagnant and depressed I feel in my life. Like I'm living Groundhog Day over and over.  I'm content in my relationship but everything else leaves me feeling unhappy and uninspired. I watched movies or read and I deeply desire for something to happen, as silly as that may sound, maybe its just monotony?
I don't know how to change that or even more importantly, to make a lasting change for the betterment of my happiness, my partner offers suggestions but between anxiety around saving and social anxiety I often don't feel like taking risks. 
I feel like I've felt like this too long now. I'm really lost what to do. 
Thanks.

Hi does anyone suffer anger depression? I have depression and find that I feel so angry at the world and I have no tolerance of anything. I'm extremely aware of it and try to control it but can't. I just blow up, then feel more depressed and guilty because of my reaction. I yelled at a boy my son played sport against yesterday. I started the day great, He had a bit of attitude and the parent from his team was argumentative with us because of their error. When the boy showed attitude I just blew up. We did both apologise and I'm so regretful as it was a build up of other things that got to me but I just st can't take it anymore. I'm a single mum, 3 kids, manage 2 sports teams and cop crap from other parents who want to take their issues out on me.  I feel like a walking time bomb.

I have no idea what these forums are all about.
I have nothing in common with anybody here.
I never went to uni.
Never ran a business.
Never been a manager.
Highest salary I ever had was 50 thou.
I never married or had kids.
I live alone, don't have many friends (only 4 good friends including my sister).
I've never been overseas.
The last sexual relationship I had was in 1987.
I can't make things or play music or anything.
I am a 65 y/o man.
I sometimes try things to fit-in and then fool myself into thinking I actually belong
but sooner than later I realise I don't and then have to pull out. 
Please don't tell me to take up bowls or ballroom dancing.

i just really need to get some things off my mind. i wanted to use the chat service but it's past 12 am. so i guess this is like an online diary where people can feel free to respond
1. i helped this girl with a scholarship type thing a while ago. the situation was that she wouldn't have been able to get it if she hadn't asked me for help bc of deadline and availability issues. this girl and i used to be semi-close, then this year we just don't talk. she doesn't talk to me normally. and it seems like she only talked to me, acted friendly and tried to be nice when she needed to get something from me. and i hate myself for just being a stupid doormat and giving in to everyone's demands. idk in the moment i'm happy to be nice and help, but later, when i'm at home and reflecting, i get so angry.
2. this other girl and i go to the gym together. it's a pre-arrangement that we go twice a week. a few days ago, she texts me 2 minutes after our session starts and says that she can't go. i brought my things especially to school in preparation, and that was my plan. it was a part of my schedule. to cancel so abruptly with no explanation left me feeling like she broke my trust, idk it might sound dramatic but i'm trying not to be too specific in case she ever reads this and realises it sounds familiar, highly unlikely though i know. i didn't have any other plans for that time period and then i had to go make some plans. it's strange because in the past, if she or i had to cancel we would do so at least the day before and like at least say why we can't go and say sorry. and i texted her asking if she had something on and she didn't reply even though im pretty sure she usually would have by now. so yeah i also feel as though i just have trust issues in general in terms of friendship

I am a male in his 40s. Have been working around 12 years as a software developer and I have to say that I am grateful as I have it better off than most people because the job description pay bad an I am not exposed to the elements.
I have suffered from depression, ocd, adhd, migraine, but I think those are just aspects of the same problem. I tried several medications and at this point I am somewhat stable. Unfortunately I love my partner, I find her very attractive but both of us take medication and out sex life is non existent.

I don't usually show my emotions or feelings. Depression has taken over the better part of my life for a while now I guess you could say it started a little over 4 years ago when my brother died. that was the first time I felt different. It's just weird how one day out of nowhere someone can be taken from you, and then 2 years ago I lost my big sister. Since then I have tried to make everyone happy to the point where I don't even know how to make myself happy. I sacrifice everything for everyone and then they turn around and say ""I never told you to do that"". But when I'm not there for them ""I never do anything for anyone"". Some days just get harder with dealing with everyone's problems and trying to find solutions for them than most. and I guess today is one of those days. I just feel like there is so much to do in so little time, to the point where my memory gets a little foggy, after forgetting something the blame game starts and I turn out to be the winner every single time.

I don't know what to do anymore.
My mental health have been decreasing since my early teens (I am currently 20) and it isn't getting better, in fact over the past year it has gotten worse. 
I have been writing my thoughts down trying to at least get it out of my head but I don't feel better, everything just feels wrong, so wrong. 
I have gone to headspace a few time and though they are trying to help there is a lot of time between sessions, and a lot of negativity around myself and my life. 
I guess the best way to try and describe how I'm feeling is out of place, empty, alone, useless, exhausted, drained, unconnected just naming a few things. 
Nothing brings me joy, nothing makes me feel truly happy, I have no prospects for the future, I don't know where I'm going in life or what I'm doing. 
I feel I have no will to live, no reason to live, I stated before that I feel alone and unconnected, and I do to family and friends, but the only time I feel content is when I'm able to be alone, reading.  Even though that makes no sense even in my own head I feel so alone but I like to be alone ?!? 
I'm drowning in my own thoughts and problems that aren't mine, I know I have a big heart and for most of my life everyone comes before me and now that I'm trying to focus on my I feel extremely guilty and selfish. 
Im having anxiety attacks at least 3 times a week and bad thought at least twice a day. I am either 'okay' or anxious or I can't do this or moody... I've been having a lot of mood swings and little things are triggering my anxiety and irritability.
 
I don't want feel or be this way, but I don't even know who I am

hi,
i don’t know who to turn to anymore so i guess that’s why i’m here. i talked to my closest friends and asked for help about my depression and bad habits and accidently influenced them in doing so. 
i’ve tried explaining to my parents how i felt and what i’m going through but they just tell me to “get it together”, or they mock me and tell me i’m just being useless and lazy. 
i’m just so sick of everything. i’ve stopped talking to people, i’ve been staying home a lot more rather than going to school and to be honest, im constantly on the verge of breaking down. i hate being around people because it makes me feel so much more out of place and alone. its a constant struggle just for me to leave the house.
i don’t know what to do. i choke up trying to talk about my depression, it’s so impossible to talk because i feel like everybody just thinks i’m a moody teen or just ‘going through an attention seeking phase’. i don’t know who or how to ask for help, but i do know that i need it really bad.
i guess i’m just asking for help on how to talk about it and ask for support after being rejected and made fun of so many times.

Hello,
i haven’t been to this forum for awhile as I thought I had done enough work during my deepest dark days through counselling and exercises.  but seems now I am slowly sliding into the deep rabbit hole again. :-( 
Is it the weather?  Winter triggers depression more than summer or are we more prone to depression in winter? I was at around the same time last year when I first identified my mental health issue.  Has anyone experienced similar things? How do you deal with it ?

Hi all,
I'm not sure how important this is in relation to other cases but I wanted to reach out for some help.
I was made redundant from my job last August (I was only 23 at the time, now 24). I have been in employed and unemployed since- about 2 months ago I took on a permanent job, out of desperation as I was unemployed at the time. I couldn't be any more unhappy in this current position. I am alone, isolated, feeling unchallenged and overall feeling lost with my overall self. I'm left at a desk for 8 hours a day with my own thoughts where every single day is Groundhog Day. Unfortunately I have attempted to reach out to management (who are interstate- all correspondence is via the telephone or email) and have been brushed off numerous times.
My point being, since being made redundant I feel like I have lost all self worth and who I am as a person. I feel lost, dealing with constant rejection and knock backs is impacting me mentally and emotionally. I have been told I have changed as a person, I'm more negative and I'm not my bright self. I see it myself too. 
Its like I'm in a deep dark hole and I'm trying to jump out of it but it's getting deeper instead. 
I want a change, but I don't know where to start. I've lost all interest in life itself and where it's taking me even trying to figure out what sort of interests I have is a blank now but I want to change that. I want a chance to prove my self worth but getting knocked down time and time again has now influenced who I've become. 
If anyone can offer some sort of advise. It would be greatly appreciated.

Hi everyone.
I am currently taking two SNRI medications once daily. I started the the first in November 2015 and the second in January 2017.
The most prominent side effect for myself has been the intense hunger, cravings and uncontrollable binge eating. I crave carbs and anything sugary. White bread, doughnuts, biscuits, chocolate, potato chips and so on. While I'm eating these kinds of foods, I feel happy and energised. Shortly after I feel guilty and lethargic. And then the cycle resets. This has caused me to gain about 25kg (55lbs) in a relatively short time.
I should probably mention this weight gain started immediately after I stopped smoking weed. I was smoking heavily every day from April 2017 to July 2017. (Approx 4 months) I didn't gain any weight. In fact, I actually lost weight.
Is anyone else on a medication combination? If so. How do you manage your diet, weight and exercise?
PS. I try to exercise at least 3 times a week for 30 minutes. (Skipping rope) and I walk an average of 5,000 to 8,000 steps every day. I loathe exercise but I know it's good for me, so I do it.
Thanks :)

This is my first time on hear as only really looked in to beyond blue today as trying to find answers an opening up. I am a shy person that’s finds its hard to talk about my feeling face to face to people. I am married with two young  beautiful boys who mean the world to me. I own my own business as a builder an am very successful in what I do as I am a very hard worker. That’s just the way I have been brought up. The problem is that unless I’m at work busting my arse an keeping busy I feel really down an have no motivation or energy. I’ve been like this now for a long time an I feel really guilty when I carnt give the boys or my wife the energy that I give to work. Please don’t take this the wrong way as I am not a bad person but I found having small amounts of drugs(meth) when I’m at my lowest point really helps me. Its like it just brings me out of that dark deep hole that I get stuck in. I now down deep that this is wrong but it make every happy when I’m happy. An that make me happy. It could be once every 2 month or 3 months but I no it’s not the right things to do. I’ve herd so many bad stories about anti depressants as I long term damage. Don’t get me wrong I now having the other is probably worse but it’s long time between. I guess I’m at the stage for some good advice as I don’t really want any drugs prescription or not. I am very strong headed when it comes to taking drugs so I no it’s not going to become a addicting as I have so much pride it my family an what I have accomplished in life. I actually feel beta just saying this on this page with out people looking down on me an making me feeling worthless. Thanks

some pyschs call this interpersonal sensitivity when depressed/anxious/irritable , I sometimes find dealing with friends or family tricky.

Hi Everyone.
I’ve had a long battle with mental illness stretching back a few years. However it has worsened over the last 12 months. Resulting in 2 hospitalisations this year. I am getting help from my GP and psychiatrist, I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD and dissociative disorder. It’s been a difficult year and due to my depression and hospital stays I found myself unable to leave bed most days and stopped working. Financially I had savings to use until they ran out a few weeks ago. This is not an issue for my partner. His issue is that he doesn’t understand mental illness and doesn’t really care to educate himself. Often he is so understanding and patient, but when I’m struggling he calls me lazy. Today we were talking about building a life that you want and he commented that I haven’t managed to build myself any kind of life so far. It was so hurtful because it’s not true. I worked incredibly hard for the last ten years until my brain betrayed me. On another occasion He laughed at a decision I made years ago that he didn’t agree with, but that I stand by. I asked him to not laugh at my life, he told me if I didn’t want to be laughed at I shouldn’t have made my life such a joke. I know alone these Sound horrible and reason to distance myself, but at other times he can be so compassionate. It’s just that all these comments are wearing me down more and triggering a week long depression each time where I find it hard to leave a dark room.
Advice on a healthy way to handle these feelings is appreciated. How do I stop myself feeling so affected by this stuff?

Hi there,
 I am a mother of a teenager who suffers from GAD - Generalised Anxiety Disorder.  He has come off his medication with the assistance of his psychiatrist earlier this year, however against the psychiatrists recommendation. I have been keeping a very close eye on him with out pressure.  Just sitting with, listening too and chatting.  Looking for body language signs etc.  So far so good, until a few weeks ago.  He lost a work book for school and the seemingly simple task of raising his hand to say, 'Ive misplaced my book."" is so debilitatingly terrifying. His breathing was tight and his face red.  It totally breaks my heart.  Not supposed to rescue him, but watching him suffer is so incredibly painful. Ive contacted the school asking for them to provide a safe space for him to tell them, without him knowing i have rung and I've provided him with a new book in the mean time so he doesn't fall behind. Ive cuddled, sat with, listened to and even sat in silence.
Im wondering if any other parents find themselves becoming overwhelmed and sinking while trying to keep their children afloat?

Does anyone else feel that there is no place in the world for them?  I have always struggled to fit in anywhere and I don't know what is wrong with me. I'm 49. Struggled to fit in at school and same goes for the workplace. Doesn't matter how hard I try I just get rejected time and again. I feel hated for no reason. I try to do the right thing by others but it counts for nothing. Got sacked from a new job yesterday. My boss blamed me for her early miscarriage said I had upset her. Is this Salem? Am I a witch that can make ill just with a look? It's plain ridiculous now. What's the point of carrying on when you can't even make friends. How weary of the world I feel!

Hi, I was diagnosed with bipolar 4-5 years ago and I’ve got a very unstable mood. I’m up and down like a yo-yo despite taking my medication regularly. My moods pretty down at the moment and I’m really struggling even though on paper my life is going really well. Is this what my life will be like forever? I feel like I can’t see an end to it all.

So in september of last year, i was diagnosed bipolar type 2, and then in march this year 2019, have been rediagnosed into bipolar type 1.
Now whilst trying 5000 different medications along the way, and treating the depression... Whenever i got slightly low or high, which seems to be a monthly reoccurring thing, cycling back and forth.. But i would always end up drinking to either A, try calm down the mania (didnt help lol) or B forget about the shitty lows bipolar brings (also doesnt help haha). Then april this year, my psychiatrist out of nowhere randomly started asking me questions about how i was in school, etc etc The list goes on and on. But anyway, up till this day at the psychiatrist i was drinking 4-5 times a week almost, as it had become an addiction.
But since the trial of the most common adhd medication in the world, it has literally gone from nearly everyday to literally once a week or less as more of a relaxation thing. Has anyone else experienced this? I used to itch and always want to go buy alcohol just to ignore the bullshit bipolar, but since being medicated for ADHD it has gone done not just a little bit, but MASSIVELY.. I cant put my finger on why it has, or how it has.. But it massively has. Since then, we have discovered I do suffer from both as im not allowed to take ADHD medication when i can feel a ""high"" coming on as it can send me too ""high"", and helps my lows a little bit aswell.. where instead of always being in the slumps, it seems to ease the ""low"" side of bipolar just that little bit. It has also literally almost completely fixed my sleeping pattern, as for years i have only gotten about 4-5 hours sleep a night on a good one, and sometimes would be up for 2 days or almost a week straight.. But now i am in bed at 9-10pm and struggling to climb out of bed at 6-7am as i finally have sleep in my eyes from i literally cant remember the last time.

Can anyone relate? I'd love to hear your stories, or comments.

I’ve been on medication for my bipolar for 10 years - all my adult life. Since starting my medication my weight has increased and increased and I’m now at my heaviest. My husband and I are trying for a baby and i know loosing some weight might help fertility. 
I’m so frustrated at my medical management. I’ve tried to tell my (multiple) GPs and (multiple) psychiatrists over the years that I feel like there is some underlying reason why I am having issues with my weight. They just keep linking my mood to my eating patterns. I’ve tried everything apart from surgery to get the weight off and nothing has helped. At this point I’m desperate. My weight is a huge trigger for stress. I’ve been doing some research about antipsychotic/antidepressants and metabolic syndromes/insulin resistance and I’m wondering if anyone else can shed some like on the subject/experience?

Recently I have been really struggling. I am a grade 10 student in high school. The school environment makes me so depressed. I have no motivation to even do simple tasks. I dread the thought of having to move to the next class when the bell rings and find it so difficult to get out of bed in the morning. I have always been a good student, with mostly straight A's and the occasional B, but the school environment - if i'm honest - makes me want to crawl under a rock and die. I feel as if I am trapped in an endless cycle of exhaustion - wake up, cry, spend 7 hours sitting at a desk, come home, cry, struggle to sleep. I have been in this cycle for at least 6 months and I don't know how to deal with it any more. I missed an entire class because I couldn't stop myself from crying in a toilet cubicle. I can't talk to my parents because they are already dealing with their own issues and I couldn't bear to unload my fragile mental state and burden them like that. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this. I feel like no one can hear me. I am falling further and further into a dark hole each day.

I am a fairly healthy 74 year old, reasonably secure financially and living in a home I own with my wife of 50+ years. I shouldn't be depressed, but I am. All my sources of support seem to be closing at the same time, these include volunteering in emergency services, sporting shooting, motorbike riding, even full time employment. This has meant that my outside support base is shrinking and I have no idea how to move forward.  The big black dog is sniffing my my heals but the local GPs seem more interested in their fees than me. Is life supposed to feel this hopeless?

Where to begin? we've been together one and half year, we met in New Zealand when we were both travelling there on a working holiday visa. He was honest to me at the beginning, said he’s an alcoholic for 5 years and he has depression since he was a teenager. He want to quit drinking, and he never deny his alcoholism. we've always been travelling in the past year, since we come from different country, kind have to, all the visa problems. We fight a lot over alcohol. He start being physically and mentally abusive. I start being crazy also. Every time he got a bottle, I try to pour it out, then we get into a fight, next morning we’ll hold each other crying and say sorry he’ll never drink again.. then, it happen again. he drink and we fight/argue from nz to china, then Indonesia. there were somedays he did really good without drinking, but never last more than 2 weeks. always some bad thing happen, to became his new excuse to start drinking again. now we are in Australia doing working holiday.. He become so mad recently, at everything, got fight with people after drunk at night, then got himself in trouble. I have realized i'm in an abusive relationship for a while, but it's so hard to let go, so hard to give up on him, to watch him suffer, I want to help so bad, but don't know how. we were trying to find a place to settle down, get a job, which, he said would help him a lot. but we just couldn't make it yet when we still travelling. and his mind set is he won't stop drinking until we settle down. but I can't deal with he drinking anymore, it drives me crazy, I thinking about breaking up all the time, and so many hurtful things he put on me, I'm mentally destroyed..but , who is going to help him? I'm the only one he has, I feel so selfish, but meantime I know it's the right choice for both of us. he is not only an alcoholic, he is in depression too. and I know partner's support means a lot to him. but, when I'm so mad at him drinking and when we argue so much, it dose't do any good for him. I tried to calm down, I searched a lot stuff online, I learned a lot, but when thing happened we do stupid things we couldn't control our anger... im so lost, so confuesed ,,don't know what to do? what's right? I just want to make the best choice for him, he needs more help than me. I'm still strong, positive, looking for a way out, for us, him and myself...but I'm so lost , and helpless..

I am a 22 year old male, living with his parents, working  7 days a week 8 - 13 hour days, haven't had a meaningful intimate relationship in 3 years. Work isolates me from my friends, when I go out to see a movie or anything that is typically a 'social' event, I go alone. I don't allow myself to be vulnerable to anyone (probably why I am here) for the reason I really don't think anyone really cares. I have had depression on and off since high school, I have seen help and have been medicated before. I know I am sick, I know I need to talk, I struggle so much to open my mouth because I really think unless the person is being paid they really don't care. How do I continue? I am constantly at odds with myself I want to go on and try harder yet I still find myself crying almost every night, in the car on my way home from work. This sickness never seems to end. How do I continue?

Hi everyone, 
I’d love some advice from anyone willing to help. The last 2 weeks I have been feeling very down and I have been crying at the drop of a hat. I have found that my work life has been made difficult because I simply can’t get through without wanting to cry. I spent 1hour at work this morning before having to go home because I couldn’t keep the tears away. There’s a few things going on in my life at the moment, but there’s definitely not anything that’s playing on my mind. I’m finding it hard to stay focused and concentrated. People will be having a conversation with me and it seems to be going straight over my head. All I want to do is be in my bed. I am sad and I don’t even know why. Any suggestions to help get out of this awful headspace?

Hi, 
I don't really know how to start these things so I'll dive right into it. 
Background: 4 years ago, my ex girlfriend and I decided to make things official. We had known each other since we were born and both grew up in rural Australia. Small town, so everyone new everyone, no secrets. 
Towards the middle of the relationship, she had a bad relationship with alcohol. She barley drank ever, but when she did - she was flirty with other guys. It got so bad that my parents had received picture of her kissing another boy and also at a wedding we were both invited to was kissing someone on the dance floor. 
Now she tells me that she has never slept with anyone. In any case, we decided to try and make things work out. She had been to clinics, seen specialists and really seemed as though she was putting the effort in to try and make us work.
She is now overseas doing a rural course for 6 weeks, and I noticed that she was being very active on social media but didn't have the time of day to respond to my text, even letting me know she got there okay and was safe. 
She promised me that it would always be her and I. But we recently had a big fight about this, and that she had told me I would always be a priority. I know this sounds needy, but my trust was broken after hearing about these cheating instances. She now has blocked me on everything. 
 I'm finding this break up extremely hard to deal with. Our families are close and no doubt I will be seeing her again. I am honestly trying to be the bigger man, but this heart break is like nothing else. 
What are your suggestions on coping with with. I had been hitting the bottle pretty hard lately which has been affecting everything. My work, my social life, my health. I have come to the conclusion that I can't be this person anymore, but need advice on how to numb the pain. 
Thank you

Hi All
I am a 28 year old male, been in a relationship for 5 years and generally have lived a good life.
I moved from Adelaide to Brisbane almost 7 years ago, when i arrived i had no work and after 4 years built myself a career in the coffee industry i started as a technician worked my way up to a state manager. I had developed a great friendship with my boss at the time we were best mates and worked well together, around 12 months ago the friendship started to drift off and i noticed that he wasnt at work alot leaving me to run the state in his absence. It turned out that he was actually building a coffee roasting business with the company owners son. This was something we were always going to do together however i didnt have a millionaire father to fund the project. 
I felt betrayed by this and left the company within a month to another company where i took on a larger and well paid role still in the coffee industry. However after 5 months i was burnt out and suffering from anxiety issues, i decided i would take the 20k in savings i had and open a coffee shop. I sunk every penny into it and was finally feeling happy with my life, during the last period of last year i had a visit from the second coffee company i had worked at and was offered my job back same money and all. 
So i decided that yes id take it and closed my shop down however after two weeks i contacted them and they informed me the owners did not want me to return. I never heard a thing back from the worker who approached me to coming back again making me feel as if i had been betrayed by a friend.
I closed my shop in February of this year and have not been able to get any work since, im getting married in October and am building a debt in my overdraft.
I feel as if i am on a rollercoaster ride some days are better but i feel as if i have failed in life and have massive issues now trusting people and trusting their word.
I have no close mates who i can talk to and feel like im going through this alone, i have always had a job since i was 15 and with no employment i feel my life has no meaning and i have no drive for life.
Im not sure what to do really, everybody keeps saying just stay positive and the universe will deliver but its been 4.5 months and i'm just not sure how much more i can give.
I dont no what to do or where to turn hoping some body on here has been through a similar situation.
Thanks
Brendan

Hi 
I have been psychotic for a few years now. At night I hear lady singing and touching my blanket to wake me up!
Obviously no one is in my house and that scares the living $hit out of me! I regularly hear ghost trying to crawl into my bedroom, just like horror film. Once or twice, I managed to confront frightening voice and face it - nobody was there!  Anger is more useful than fear - basic psych 101 - arnie said that in that awful terminator film.
I am on anti psych meds and regular therapy. There is no cure so I have accepted my condition. 
BUT what can I do about Depression which I hear is treatable!
Just looking for ways people here have perhaps found way LONG TERM to keep their depression in check or even beat it ? 
Please share your experiences... Thanks in advance.

Me;
Manic Depressive
General Anxiety Disorder
PTSD

So I work 4 days a week, its hard but its manageable for the time being.
On my days off I go to the gym for an hour or more as I've been trying to get back into shape was 95kg at the start of the year and I'm down to 78kg - yay for small wins but thats pretty much all I do. I work and I go to the gym on my days off, rinse and repeat.
I've lost all my (2-3) close school friends over the years and now I'm stuck in a city that I absolutely hate.
Making friends with anyone has got to be the hardest thing it takes time to be friends with people but generally I've never had many friends and a lot of people just dont seem to like me. I've grown so used to being along these days but at the same time really long to have a friend. Animals are great but its not the same. Simply put the dating scene for me also is - not good.
I'm just getting really over everything at the moment.
I've come such a long way in the past 10 months from having social anxiety to where I was failing my classes as I'd be having panic attacks sitting in my car unable to go in before class to now working in retail dealing with people on almost a daily basis. I guess I had too higher expectations for how things would be.. Its great the my anxiety isnt as much of an issue anymore but I really thought things would be different. I feel like I could so easily crash and burn right now that everything I've achieved is slowly just slipping out of my hands.

Your GP tells you that your Body Mass Index calculation puts you in the obese range. Or perhaps like me once I read a referral and in it is that word ""obese"". How demoralising!
BMI is- ""The body mass index or Quetelet index is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is universally expressed in units of kg/m², resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres"". 
So basically if you are short and large for your height your BMI will be high = obese.
While it is a calculation that is accepted in the medical profession how does this help those of us that acquire a mental illness or are simply sad about being overweight? Well if you are like me, I leave the clinic more upset than when I walked in which takes me to the nearby bakery to swarm around some donuts to repair the shame.
What is the ways we can overcome this problem? Here is my method-

Doing the best you can with that old aged remedy, more exercise and less food consumption. Lets get that in perspective - eat healthier, limit junk food and walk daily. 
Accept you'll never be a slim person. This effects females more than males.  
Focus on you capabities not your restrictions 
Dont make your excess weight a bigger issue than life itself. Your personality, kindness, compassion etc is of greater importance 
BMI is a calculation for the benefit of those that dedicate their lives to helping others. It indicates to them that you need such assistance. Its purpose is not to shame. 
If your GP is slim, like most other slim people he/she might drop words that are offensive. Accept that if you were slim you might not relate to overweight people either nor our sensitivities.
As a man women that are overweight can look attractive with how they dress but how they laugh with their bubbly personality - well I just want to cuddle them. Accept you have the capacity to be as attractive as anyone else.
Discount the judgemental. We do this to people that dont understand mental illness or are cruel. We reject those that hold prejudicial views on race, sexuality and religion then stand proud and ignore them.
Love animals. They love you back unconditionally 
Admire yourself for your achievements
Order only one donut
Keep physically active
Love friends and family. Everyone adores affection. Ask people questions about themselves- they'll love you for that.
Leave the BMI in your medical file at the clinic not in your mind.

I’ve lived in Australia 2 years, I’m 46,I work alone as a cook in early years child care.i did the same thing in UK, I had colleagues every day was fun, I enjoyed my job, now I hate it, hate cooking. I’ve very limited conversations with anyone, it’s soul destroying. in my break I walk around the streets & at the end of the day I go home To my 11 yr old daughter who mainly sits in her room, then my partner comes home, he is a ward clerk so has no interest in having big conversations.I have no friends, no family here. My partners family don’t like me so I’ve not seen them since Xmas where I had to endure a full day in their company knowing they don’t care for me & apparently my partners friends think I am a bit much, which is possibly down to me having zero interaction with people for 95% of my life. I am socially awkward but when I get my confidence up then I’m too much for people, there is no happy medium, people just don’t take to me or want to be my friend, this has been happening all my life, I’ve had a few good friends in my life but nothing since been here, I talk to people briefly while out then I come away despondent because I know it won’t amount to anything, I friend request them on Facebook and that’s it, nothing more, I’m embarrassed to tell people I have no friends, so I sit at home and watch TV,scroll through Facebook to see what people in UK are doing then get upset. i used to love music, going to gigs and I am in a band and you would think that would create a social outlet but it hasn’t, I feel like quitting the band because while my partner gets people talking to him,no one talks to me, Im quite intimidating, nearly six foot with resting bitch face which doesn’t help and I do try and be mindful of that but obviously I’m not approachable. I did jewellery for a bit,genealogy but they are isolating hobbies, I joined netball but the girls were much younger,everyone has their own lives etc, so i packed it in. I don’t have much money so can’t afford a gym or to do a course.I can’t face going to meetups on my own which I’ve looked at. I can’t even afford counselling and went to a place where people were training to be counsellors for a cheap rate but I hated it, it made me feel worse, I was not brought up to be spiritual so counselling/self help books don’t help. I don’t answer the door or answer my phone if it’s a withheld number and I have zero retail therapy unless I do it alone. I’m becoming more and more internal. How do I move on?

I’ve recently started therapy again but I feel like I need to talk about how I’m feeling now.
I am tired, of feeling like a disappointment, of feeling like everything I do is pointless and not good enough, like I’m a waste of space, a waste of people’s time money and effort. 
I feel like I can’t physically or mentally do the much needed and important things I need to do, like uni assignments.  Then when I don’t do them I feel even worst because I didn’t do the thing. I feel completely useless.

hi all
this probably has been written before but how does anybody justify to themselves that although shit does happen in your life you will get through it. 
i know that writing down the problem seems to help but how can i tell it to shut up. i have only just recently gotten back on anti depressants and i have gotten out of my shell so to speak but how can i justify to my self that although i know that others are different and its ok that rejection happens and although the other person is probably like i was before. how do you cope in situations like this. i am starting to feel as if i dont fit into any 'category'. any tips would be grateful and i hope to continue on here and hopefully see me here more.
Thanks and sorry if this has already been answered before to lazy to find it :)

I have finally been diagnosed with Environmental Depression, which I understand and totally agree with. I am not in a financial position to escape this, does anyone know of any organisations/people that can help ?

Hi All
i am new around this forum and the topic of depression, however I would like to firstly thank everyone in the community for all the info available it has helped me understand and cope with my situation greatly. Secondly I would like to tell my story.i have recently been to my GP (a big deal for me) because I felt very stressed and angry All the time. It has been affecting all aspects of my life. I have had several major issues happen in my personal and work life that have caused me to feel this way.i spoke to my doctor briefly about my issues and feelings, he has diagnosed me with depression and started me on anti-depressants. Before I went to the Doctor I did not think I had depression however now after being more informed and researching depression I do think I have some type of depression. I feel more angry and hopeless in my situation than sad though. I do have a lot of the symptoms of depression but am more angry than sad. I have not been happy for a long time. I felt better the first week after going and talking to the doctor about it and starting the Anti- depressants. I have not been sleeping properly for a long time now and have been smoking pot to help me relax take my mind of things and sleepThis was all OK or so I thought until I had a smoke last Sunday night after tea and went positive on a drug test at work 12 hrs later. I have been stood down for a week now waiting a decision to see if I keep my job. I will say that I have never been to work stoned, don't smoke before or at work. Anyway this has had a big impact on my mental well being.i have been a long term user of pot and now I do wonder if this has caused some of my problems, anyway I have now stopped.i am going back to my GP this week and will discuss the smoking pot, also a follow up on the anti-depressant, which I don't think are working yet. He has advised seeing a physiologist which I think I will now as I feel I need to talk to someone about my situation and feelings. I think this will help.This has all been a big deal for me I have never had much to do with depression or mental illness. Like I said this site has helped me a heap as I feel a bit alone with this. I told work I started taking Anti-depressants but feel that they don't understand my situation at all and now testing positive for pot has just made it all worse.
Anyway I just wanted to tell my story, vent a little and say thanks to everyone for understanding and helping in this community. i do feel better now I have talked about and addressed my issues. Still feel I have a long way to go but do feel I can and will get better. What I have learned is that there are all sorts or depression and guess I just need to work through this with the help of others. I think I may have some anger issues as well.  

Would appreciate any feed back from others as reading about people's situations and reading people's comments has made me understand and feel a lot better.

I've struggled for years now with my mental health. My depression all too consuming, that sometimes I feel it is too much for me. To know I am not alone in my journey is something that kind of makes it easier. Support has become my hope, so I am writing on here to show anyone out there without the support that people care for you, including me. I use to be scared to talk about my depression or let people know that I am not okay, but hiding from the truth does no good. Mental illness is just as important as any other illness, so I am no longer ashamed of what I have, I have learnt to accept it. This is not something I chose, the depression chose me. I've come to terms with the fact that I have a chemical imbalance in my brain and taking tablets each day is just something I need to do in order to function.
The other day I had a terrible day and decided to write down what depression felt like for me. I am going to share it on here to show others that you're not alone and I know exactly how it feels day in and day out.....
""I’m struggling more than words can describe. The pain is overwhelming, my mind is suffocating. I try my best to fight but sometimes I consider whether there is anything worth fighting for anymore. The pain in my head can be unbearable, almost consuming. A dark cloud that swarms over me out of nowhere, but always lingering around. Somehow, I manage to push through every time; a strength stronger than anyone could ever imagine. Almost beyond words. ""
We are the strong, we fight everyday, I am proud of myself and I can only hope that this message reaches at least one person in need.

Think i hit a rut. Expectations were that life would (feel) pretty good at this age (25). Happy to get out of school and into the real world (no friends, bullied) and decided to pursue a career in hospo (made friends, mostly through alcohol and drugs) I Left that environment after six years to choose a career in accounting. But 2.5 years in uni I have an accounting job but no time for hobbies (too much study) or enough time to work on my health then i would like. Overall i still no friends that i can rely on. Havent had gf in 3 years either! Assumed i would make many friends at uni but never happened lol. Many of my friends now engaged or have kids, while im in uni for 1.5 years left.. feels like im starting all over again.. end goal will be worth i know but right now im bored and lonely where i am? I also have no time for new hobbies and the only hobby i want to do is travel and meet new people
Obviously not happy in current environment. And i need a change of some sort. And i feel sad most of the time. I dont see the point of staying in the same town working sleeping and studying if i dont have a social life or friends to truly share my time with. But uni! Its controlling my life. And i cant just quit it that would be silly. Moving to another city may require me to repeat 2-3 subjects. Study abroad i got rejected as marks werent high enough. 
Question: should I..
1. Take a leave of absence from uni (6 months min) and travel abroad (something im passionate about) come back broke but alive because i did more than just exist and used time to work on personal development
2. Do what everyone else is telling me to do and ‘suck it up’ for a year and a half even though they cant understand how i feel
I know the answer may seem obvious but this is a big decision and i just want the opinions of someone who had to alter their commitments for the greater good of self improvement and actual happiness before i just quit my accounting job, take time off uni and basically spend all my savings ($10k) to live somewhere new. Living in sydney australia can really take its toll as many want the aussie dream and / or the career ladder and its gets to you sometimes cause your outside the bubble.

What’s the point in wasting majority of life depressed, I mean I would love to be my old happy self again, who I was maybe about 9- 10 years ago. And I’ve tried, and I’ve kept trying but with no success. Why keep fighting - what is the point. I can’t even afford to go to a psychologist anymore, I can barely afford to renew my anti depressant script. Not that they did much anyway. All I do is cry and hate myself and it’s just so tiring. This year was supposed to be my year, but it’s gone absolutely awful thus far. Also I’m fairly positive I have binge eating disorder - which doesn’t help how much I absolutely detest myself. Each day I hate myself a little bit more and have less to look forward to in my life. I’m a full time uni student (again) with two jobs, no time for myself, pretty destitute each week I struggle to pay for necessities, that doesn’t stop me from wasting it on extra food to feed my fat hungry mouth.... my partner left me because my depression was “too draining” for him. So not only am I depressed, I am also unloveable. Again... what’s the point. I don’t know what I want to achieve from this post. I can’t afford help. I don’t have enough time for myself to get help anyway. Again - what’s the damn point. I’ve cried enough tears and I’ve thought enough thoughts. I am sick of it.

I’m really struggling since my husband kicked me out for the second time and took away my keys to the house so I couldn’t return 😪 I hVe since moved out with my kids
i have felt so broken since and I am so up and down with my mood when we were together I had a lot of issues with my step son who is 10 he would be so rude roll his eyes at me back chat me and talk to me like crap and I was constantly arguing with him and my husband would never say anything. I get like I had no support from him my step son just doesn’t like being told no plain and simple and would constantly lie about everything ! Everyday was a struggle and if it went on for too long I would start to be quite horrible towards him cause I’ve teached my limit and when I would finally crack it and say something to my husband about the way his son had been towards me he would just say well your speaking to him like crap so I’ve been letting him speak to you like it !!!
This has been going on for so many years I even took him on with my other 3 kids in my home town for 18months as my husband couldn’t look after him cause of his work and his sister had left town
I had 5 kids in the house to look after my 16yr old his 7yr old daughter his 10yr old son and our 3 yr old and 1 Yr old , he would come home sit on couch and be on his phone I felt like I had no support and got so stressed daily
he tells me I’m getting big or putting on weight I ask him to stop he tells me he doesn’t care how much I put on he wouldn’t love me all the same
he checks out the fit mums in front in me constantly talks about other woman r says he would like me to feel jealous cause that app would make me want him more
if I want to go away for weekend to see my girlfriend back home he would crack it and make me feel bad cause he is left at home alone
I’m trying to fix things but things just don’t seem to be getting any better apart he needs my help with his kids as his parents have gone up north now and I’m going straight back to being stressed with his son and he doesn’t say anything I’m crying all the time and I feel very aggressive
I hVe been on medication for years and years I’ve decided before I was kicked out to try another drug cause I thought maybe it wasn’t working so dr put me on another medication now  and I just feel quick to anger and I feel like I just cry all the time and am up and down constantly

Hmm... where should i even begin. This is a first for me, I've spoken with a few people in my life before but my circle isn't the best. My whole life i tried to help everyone i can, all i ever got in return was betrayal. I was a completely different person in 2014 and now i feel like a miserable lonely vessel. I am thankful to have a roof over my head and parents and brothers; even though inside i don't like my brothers choices. I won't act like i am the only one who had tragedy in life but i feel every year is getting worse for me. I don't even want to leave my room or speak with a single person. Most times i am forced to speak and often i find myself just starring somewhere else or in my own world rather than speaking to someone. I have been cheated and used my whole life, I've done a lot of dark things i am not proud of (No drugs), and unfortunately those were the times i was the most alive. I tried to do good, get a job, make my parents happy and try to be the son they wanted, since my brothers all failed, and improve my own life before i become a criminal and what happened? I am just depressed now. I feel worthless and like a slave working a 9to5, I've drilled it into me that i am a slave which is stupid, but for the life of me i cannot remove that thought. My father almost died and permanently changed him in 2015, my brother almost died and both his legs snapped in 2016, my best friend and the biggest impact on my life died in my arms --My dog-- in 2017, my brother went to prison in 2018 and now my only best friend is in prison this year. This depression has ruined me and i fear i cant break away. I don't know if anyone will respond but i just wanted to write this somewhere. Also every job i ever did have i just hated. I hated so much my life felt so miserable and empty inside. My smiles were always fake, until i got to my room and locked my door to be myself. I am afraid to get another job that i haven't worked for two years, i can't deal with anymore depression and anxiety, i just can't. I haven't went to the doctors, i know many people who changed for the worse once they got on the doctors prescriptions. I don't know how this will sound to another person reading, but it is what it is....this life holds no value in my eyes. Money has ruined everyone i love and the thought of it disgusts me and the fact i have to slave to earn it just to live kills me inside. I am just all over the place with these thoughts and depression. Yearly it grows worse.

I am struggling with this fight against depression which began when I was 16. I am now 27. I like to think of myself as strong as I keep going despite everything but I am just so tired of feeling low daily. I do not wish to take antidepressants as I was prescribed these from 16 to early 20s with little help and many side effects. I try to manage naturally with my lifestyle.
This year I cut contact with my narcissistic mother which has been good for me while being one of the most difficult things I have done. Serving her needs and putting up with her abuse for so many years now has me lost. 
I came home to one of my little dogs passed away in Jan, my other dog was sitting next to her barking, I have trouble getting the image out of my head and missing her.
I moved in with my boyfriend who is my first ever partner in Feb. He is very loving and supportive, I am so fortunate to have found him. I have found it difficult breaking down constantly in front of him as I have always dealt with this is isolation. I feel embarrassed crying constantly and don't want to bring him down.
I was made redundant in March from my full time property management job which I never liked and it paid poorly. I have kept myself busy with work over these last few years, often with burnout. I lived by myself with my 2 dogs and am used to being independent. I ran out of money 3 weeks ago. Centrelink has declined my request for support. I cannot gain citizenship being a New Zealander, I have lived here 11 years as my father brought us here for his work. He passed away 5 years ago from a heart attack at 56 years of age. Grief doesn't go away I just made space for it. 
My partner is paying the rent with his Centrelink benefit. Jobs are hard to come by with the amount of people applying. I am applying daily but am feeling really hopeless and useless not contributing. 
I have been thinking about seeing a psychologist again but it is so difficult to action this, I have been through many before. I have been pushing myself to get out walking daily, writing to heal from my mother's abuse and a lot of repressed emotions came up last month. I have trouble focusing on my interests and go numb at times. I don't have any close friends.
Any advice would be appreciated lovely people. Thank you.

Dunno how to shake him though or to just shake the situation in general, like he is relentless and just never gives up in his relentless attacks and/or negativity on me.

Hi ,
Im into my ninth year of depression 
It started from a marriage breakdown, which tends to destroy the family unit, a few chronic health issues and massive financial loss on the unfinished family home due to the breakdown
I think I was always headed this way as I suffered from massive anxiety my whole life (I thought it was normal as I was very introverted) and mum and dad both suffered mental problems .
My brother suicided in his late twenties
Over the last nine years Ive lost track of different specialists and phycs Ive seen ,I know the early years my GP would set up 14 visits with specialists then it dropped back to 10 visits a year with medicare changes so a lot of visits 
Ive been on so many meds ,none work for me due to side effects ,so currently on none and totally over phyc visits ,I know what they,re going to say before they do
Both mum and dad lived long lives ,happily married but both died unexpectedly 11 weeks apart just on 12 months back which has been harder to deal with than I would of ever thought possible 
I don't really sleep ,I haven't for 9 years ,I workout and look after my diet and health as best as I can but the head is a mess 
when I do get sleep in bits and pieces Im usually dreaming in dark places ,so often I wake in a hell of a state 
I used to think to myself that this state my head is permanently in is like being dreadfully homesick for a place and people that don't exist ,but not just normal homesickness ,life threatening 
Ive so many times been in an incredibly dark place and thought thru what my brother must of been feeling but I have this couple of daughters that enter my mind and that brings me back ..
anyway these days ,I live alone ,I don't socialise at all ,the way I am, no more relationships seem possible ,Im so introverted and messed up with anxiety and depression ,I was put on a pension years back with this so outings are few
Now heres the big thing over the years Ive realized Ive become an expert ,no one knows about my condition ,My daughters don't know ,family and friends .Sure they know Im introverted ,that's just me and they know Im not the happiest person in the world but if they knew the truth ,wow ...........My daughters would not leave me alone ever if they knew and with that no one knows to keep that safe.
So this forum maybe just what I need ,as hard as it is to describe this condition

I'm not doing too well. I had been feeling much better this year despite some ups and downs along the way, largely due to getting me my medication right. I have been sick for four months with a sore throat and bouts of 'flu' along the way. I'm just getting over my latest bout. I've had blood tests and a CT scan and all they have shown is I have inflammation. 
I am starting to feel worn out again mentally and I suspect my physical illness (including the inflammation) is a huge factor. My old obsessive anxiety is back, I'm feeling grief again re my failed marriage, and I'm otherwise mentally flat. 
I'm really over being sick and yes I could go back to my doctor all he will say is I have a viral infection.
I don't know what I'm asking for in response to this post. I can't think clearly.

Hi all,
I have a question about quitting SSRI's and irritability.
I slowly tapered off SSRIs about two months ago, after being on them 15 years. I had brain zaps and other symptoms for a month, and these have dissipated. Good news is I'm not feeling depressed. Bad news is I'm really irritable and have lost patience and tolerance. I'm feeling what I would call stress, rather than anxiety. This is kind of hard for me because I'm in a job that requires some patience and tolerance so I don't feel like I'm doing as well at my job, and also I'm not as tolerant at home. I'm controlling it as best as I can on both fronts but feel like I'm holding on against a tidal wave all the time.
I've been on SSRIs so long that I'm having difficulty understanding if this is from SSRI discontinuation, or if it's really me not on SSRIs! I don't want to go making lifestyle changes, like quitting my job and doing something else, if it's a symptom of SSRI discontinuation, which I know it is in the short term, but it's now been two months so I'm questioning if it's related to discontinuation now, or if it's just me.
Has anyone else experienced symptoms from quitting SSRIs that go this long?
Thanks for any help!
Jason

I've been doing really well the past year or two but the swirling
black dog has returned with a vengeance, the worst it's been.
Lost Mum a few weeks back after caring full time for her for
the past 7 years. She was 97, but there is a big hole but that's
not the reason for the plunge downward. Not sure what the
reason, does there have to be one? Bit scared of the dark thoughts 
I'm having, I've lost purpose all of a sudden, bugger it.

Hi,
I haven't been on for a while - I'm just not motivated. I'm nearly 40 and still trying to figure out my ""reason"" to be depressed and anxious. Does anyone else feel like this? I'm struggling with money and am a busy mum but is this reason enough? Or is there no reason? I'm just lost....does everyone have a reason or are there others out there who just don't know why they feel like this? - feeling lost....

It seems that I have become a completely different person.
I cry for no reason, or over the most insignificant things. 
A few of my friends know about this, as I have told them when I'm in my darkest times for some help. Most of them are kind and understanding, but I feel as if they don't really believe me.
They will offer their advice and try to relate it to themselves to make me feel like I am not alone, but it never works. Of course, I am more than grateful that they try their best to help me, but I just feel like a joke to them.
Sometimes, I also dissociate. Now this, I haven't told anyone. It's happened quite a few times, but there are only 2 instances I can think of where it's really impacted me. One of them lasted for over 3 days.

I don't really know where I'm going with this thread, I just felt like I needed to get this out even if it doesn't make sense.
I just want to have a day where I am genuinely happy and feel loved. I don't want to be stuck like this forever, and even though I'm only 15, it feels like this is never going to change.
I think I'll just have to keep pushing all my mental struggles to the side, because I'm nearly an adult and apparently that is more important to focus on then my feelings now. 
I don't know who I am or why I am even here, because the sadness and intrusive thoughts fog my mind and I can't bring myself to focus on anything else.
I don't know what to do, I just want it to stop. I want to feel normal. I want to look back on these years and feel like I have actually had a childhood, not just wish I had one.
Everything seems pointless when I just have these overwhelming feelings that won't let me focus on anything else.

Hello,
my partner and I had been together for 5 years and he recently moved two hours away for work. I went and spent the weekend with him, we had a great time going hiking and making plans for me to move down and join him. Come Sunday I didn’t want to leave and cried but the thought I would be seeing him again in two weeks was comforting.
 
yesterday I was out when his dad came to the door and told my parents my partner had a motorbike accident and didn’t survive. 
 
I feel completely sick I can’t sleep or eat. I keep picturing blood and shattered teeth and getting a choking sensation. The pain is unbelievable I can’t sfop sobbing. I keep thinking about him if I hadve stayed maybe I could’ve stopped this from happening. 
 
I keep expecting to get a message and it be from him. Twenty minutes after the accident I sent him a ‘what are you up to today’ and got annoyed when I didn’t hear a response, 8 hours later I found out why. I feel completely guilty I want to feel him hug me again. 
i honestly feel like I will never be happy again I just want him back I would do anything :(

Hi, I thought I would post something on here to see if I could get some support to how I am currently feeling. I am 42, no kids, no wife. Have not been able to hold on to a relationship for long enough. I bought a house under a seasonal flight path and can't forgive myself as I feel like I have failed. I want to move but the housing market is  terrible. I have a stressful job that should be rewarding but feel I am not going anywhere. I feel trapped in my work and where I live. Being 42 I can't meet anyone on dating apps and all my friends are married with kids or with long term partners. I feel I am wasting my time and in a constant state of unhappiness.

Hello one and all...
This is my first post on here. I just typed out a lengthy explanation of my current situation and it exceeded the character limit by far. I wasn’t sure how to narrow it down effectively so I am just writing this super basic background for now. I am diagnosed Bipolar I (has nearly been changed to Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective several times now) and I am really struggling. I had my last psychotic episode in December last year and was hospitalised until February. They wanted to keep me in for at least another eight weeks but I managed to get out of it. In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have been discharged when I was. I was somewhat manic until I completely crashed about two months ago now. I am living alone in the bush about fifteen minutes from the nearest small town. I lost my job and my relationship following my episode. And consequently my life. I have no reason whatsoever to get out of bed each day. I have no motivation to do absolutely anything and only leave the house when I absolutely have to. Usually to get tobacco. I am certainly not eating well. A lot of the time I eat nothing at all during a day. I can’t shower at my house at the moment due to water/plumbing issues that my real estate/landlord is yet to rectify. So my hygiene practice is pretty much null and void. I shower maybe twice a week at a “friends” house while he is at work. I say “friends” because he is a horribly toxic influence on my life (long story for another time) and I choose to keep him at bay. I am on no medication since leaving hospital and am smoking marijuana every day in an effort to cope. I am stopping the latter in a couple of days mind you. Only thing I can currently think of to do that might help me right now. I am completely isolated. No friends or family and certainly no support. I have thought of going back to hospital but know they will only drug me up mega and I will be back here where I started before too long. I am on the DSP now which is hard when paying rent. I barely have enough left over for food and petrol so I couldn’t even eat properly if I wanted to. The bills are starting to pile up and I am at a loss at what to do there either. So basically absolutely everything is a mess and I am quickly fading away... Thank you to those who took the time to read this and those who may respond.

Hello 
not sure where to start or what to say, I’ve had anxiety and depression for a long time, and take medication since my early teens (I’m in my 30s) 
I have experienced a few rough years, and now have isolated myself in a bubble, it gets overwhelming and I get anxious, but not over things that seem significant, 
my family have left or passed, i miss them a lot and feel rudderless with out my father 
I struggle to make any relationships with friends, meet new people, dating is a mind field. the few friends I do have don’t have time for me, I feel unwanted, I’m constantly exhausted, I live in a beautiful area but everything looks grey, the only thing happy to see me is my pet
I don’t want to inconvenience the family I do have, and I don’t feel comfortable talking with my gp, i feel useless, lost and exhausted, sleep constantly and have no energy, no life 
I’m not sure where else to talk?

Hi, Im new to this. I don’t really know where to begin. I think if I speak up about it,
people will think I’m faking it for attention because I always act happy, though
lately I’ve been finding it more difficult and breaking down at random
times, and I am rather young (17, F) and I’ve heard lots of people say teenagers fake depression.I have searched up the symptoms of
depression, and even though I know it’s different for everyone, I have been having
lots of the symptoms for a while. Today I took the depression/anxiety
test, and got high (40) which recommended me to see a GP ASAP. I don’t want to waste the GP’s time in case I’m fine, which I might
be since I believe things easily and overreact to things.  It could just be the sadness I’m feeling about
some things that have been happening lately. I have always been paranoid, nervous and insecure. I have always felt anxious about things such
as speaking in front of the class-or even just ordering food, I have always had
a habit of kicking/swinging my legs, I’ve always hated my physical
appearance, I have always felt like I’m not good enough, always felt
worthless, but I’ve only become
aware of how bad it’s been recently. I have always been paranoid about the most
random things at the most random times, but lately I feel like everything I was
afraid would happen is happening. I have been a bit shaky at random times
which I haven’t noticed before.I've been having a hard time
trying to feel really happy, or even just neutral. I’m always either feeling
numb or mental/physical pain. Sometimes I feel like there’s literally a big
dark cloud over my mind to prevent me from thinking about things apart from sadness.In the last few years I have been a
good student with great grades, but lately I’ve been having a harder time
paying attention in class. While my grades have been going
down, everyone else’s grades seem to be going up, so I have been comparing
myself to people more than
ever. I want good grades, I want to be productive, but I’ve just been
struggling with it.I have a hard time falling asleep and getting out of bed
when I wake up. I stay in bed for as long as possible, I stress eat in bed,
I have been watching more videos/playing more video games than doing homework, I
don’t really exercise anymore, and sometimes I don’t have an appetite at all. Sometimes I randomly feel physical
sharp chest pains and have a hard time breathing, not just in situations not make
me nervous, even just when I’m relaxing.

I've always struggled with anxiety, and I believe this was due to being bullied in primary school by a group of girls. 
 
Fast forward 15 years, I have miraculously found myself in a great Government Job, a lovely and supportive boyfriend, a very small (but close) network of friends and colleagues and of course a roof over my head. The problem is, I'm still being followed by a dark fog that is my anxiety and depression. I feel empty most days. I struggle to keep up with everyday life as I'm overwhelmed by everything. I feel tight in my chest constantly and I feel like people can see through me. I've begun crying, often, which is concerning my boyfriend who has always been extroverted, confident and has a huge support system in his family and friends.
My anxiety has gotten so bad that I've been told by my naturepath that this is affecting my gut, my skin (always breaking in acne), and my female hormones. So on top of my emotional/mental issues I'm also working through these physical problems.
I'm so anxious now that it's affecting my speech. I've always considered myself to be articulate and well spoken, however in the past few months I've noticed myself stuttering on words and struggling to string coherent words together. I feel like I don't even want to speak to people now because I end up being embarrassed about how I sound like a child speaking.
My self esteem is also incredibly low. I feel like the 'dumb' friend, also due to the latter. I feel like people find me boring because I hold back on being myself. In conversations, I always try and turn it back onto the other person to avoid me having to go into any particular topics in case I struggle to physically talk about it. I feel ashamed that this is even an issue in my life.
 
Anyways....I don't even know what I'm doing here.

I have been off work now for almost a year. Work and burnout were
certainly some of the catalysts for what continues to be a tumultuous and
protracted mental health crisis. I go around in tortuous circles contemplating
when or if I will ever go back to work. This is awful for me and I imagine for
anyone I bring along with me on my roller-coaster (e.g. a friend or a supervisor).
I am feeling awful about leading people to believe that I might be coming back
to work in some form and then letting them down. I hate myself for getting others'
hopes up and then letting them down almost as quickly.

I have very ridged black and white thinking. At times, I thoroughly hate
this weak part of me that is seemingly helpless and hopeless. At times, I want
nothing more than to deny I have any issues and just carry on with life like other
people do. This seems to be inevitably followed by a harsh reality that I'm not
okay and that I'm plainly not up to it. My constant oscillating between going
back to work and not going back to work is itself distressing and disheartening.
It's not just the extremes between being a 'failure' and being a 'success', I
am forever in two minds about going back to work at all.

Black and white thinking is not that unusual. It's very very common. So
the social pressures to return to 'normality' are strong and shame inducing. I
feel doomed to forever feel guilt and shame for the way I am. Even some mental
health professionals engage in this. The question gets asked, when am I going
back to work? My answer... I don't know. For me, work is one of the reasons I'm
in this mess. If I was suffering from cancer, it's unlikely the question would
come up. Or the insinuation that you're plainly lazy, what do you do with your
days? My answer... nothing much, sleeping, resting, maybe read the news.

Does anyone else deal with this? How do people manage these unhelpful
thought patterns and social pressures? How do people navigate the constant to
and fro or ups and downs? I feel I need to guard against bringing people along
with me on my roller-coaster to avoid the seemingly inevitable low points where
I let people down.

Suffering from major depression and CPTSD symptoms. I'm on anti depressants and other medication if needed. I also do therapy. All I do is sleep and lay in bed all day when not sleeping. I do not go out everyday. When I do go out it's just to get groceries and go back home. Some days I don't even shower. I have had washing to fold and put away for five days now and all I do is stare at it. I have no friends and family is busy doing there own life.
I spend my days completely alone and isolated. I find myself not wanting to be around negativity or negative people. It makes me feel irritable and like I want to run a mile. I'm also struggling to eat which is strange for me because I love food.
II'm basically living in a state of fear of the outside world which is not rational. I'm scared people are going to hurt me.
II'm having relationship issues on top of this. Recently my partner lied to me and I found out. It ripped me apart. I guess all the stress of the last four months has gotten to me now.
I keep asking myself everyday how am I going to get out of this depression and I'm struggling for answers. I'm fully busy just trying to get myself through each day. Each day feels like ground hog day. I don't know how to tell anyone what I'm going through. I feel as if I'm a burden and I got to do it myself which makes me feel so sad as I've always been there to help others.
II just feel beyond sad and hurt.

Hi all. Going through a recent separation and it’s hit me hard. I’m at the point where I think I will be taking anti depressants to get me through, bring back some quality to my life hopefully. I was not depressed prior to the separation so the doctor indicated this is circumstance based or similar. I’m interested to hear from people who were in a similar boat. Took them due to a big incident in their lives. Did they work for you? And how long did you need to take them before you came out the other side? I understand we are all unique and ultimately it’s going to my medical professionals that guide me but I’m still interested in hearing about people’s experiences.

Hey there! I'm new, and figured I'd reach out.
TL;DR, i've been depressed for awhile and I've known I've been depressed for awhile. I got diagnosed last year, and it was a really exciting experience for me, I'm finally going to get help! Depression has always been an up and down for me and I'm thankful for those experiences I had with counselling and trying medication for the first time.
Fast-forward to now. I'm no longer on medication (it wasn't really working for me anymore, plus I'm in a better space mentally so I figured there wasn't much need for it. came off of these with the help of my doctor). I wouldn't consider myself a very emotionally depressed person, I don't think I feel sad often, but I do feel drained and tired pretty much all the time. I've kind of been getting frustrated with my situation as of late-- I want to do things but no matter how much I sleep or try, it's an effort, and it feels like I have to sit around and wait until this tired spell passes. Not too long ago I was stuck in a really bad one for over a month. I had conversed with my doctor and figured it 'might' have been an iron deficiency. I took supplements for a month and it changed nothing. Then, about a week ago, I finally came out of it and it was great! I could keep a sleep schedule, I wanted to go and exercise and do things, I just felt like me again, but now I feel myself falling back into the tired spell again.
I've been told numerous times to try and keep a good sleep schedule and try to exercise and etc, but the problem at the moment is that the way I see it now, those things are a result of being in a good headspace and physical condition. I can't do that right now, exercise doesn't help, keeping a good sleep schedule is impossible. I feel like I'm at my wits end and I don't know what to do. I just want to be awake again.

Hi all,
I've posted on here once before and once again life is kicking me around like a football and I need help. My family (mum, sister, and I) adopted a beautiful puppy about 6 months ago. He has had health issues all his life but we have pushed through and sought treatment. SO far, his treatment has cost about 6K and we are a lower middle class family and cant afford this, but we love him so mum has picked up extra shifts ect. Recently his condition has gotten worse and the vet told us ""euthanasia wouldnt be unkind"". We either pay 7K (which is money we dont have) for a temporary fix or put him down. I love this dog more than anything, I dont have friends due to some people i was once friends with hating me and spreading bad lies and so forth. This year i spent my birthday alone with him (the puppy), and he is genuinely the best dog in the world. However, since he is in pain all the time i understand what we need to do. I'm not sure im ready to let him go though, and since my mother told me i have been heartbroken. 
I don't know how to get on with life. I dont want to kill myself, i just want to stop existing for a little while. It sounds stupid and it's not all about the puppy but it just feels like everything is going from bad to worse. I just wish i could fix all these problems. 
If anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated!

So this us my first post and I'm really unsure what to write, 
I'm a mum to 2 beautiful children, but the past 2 weeks I've began to resent my life as a mum.
I hear my baby crying and it makes me mad. I don't know how to feel love again. I would never in a million years harm my children.
I feel so alone although my partner is very helpful after work but during the day I feel like I just can't do it anymore. I wake up and realize it's the same old thing just a different day. I show no emotion to anyone because being realistic no one even cares. We as humans are selfish and as long as things are 'ok' then why do we need to bother to see what's really going on. 
I feel stupid for feeling like this. Life really isn't that bad so what's my problem. 
I'm sick of looking at the same walls I'm sick of wearing the same bum clothes because what's the point in even getting dressed nicely when I feel like I look fat and horrible. How do I break this feeling? I force myself to shower, force myself to clean my house, for my self to fake a smile so that I can pretend for 5 minutes that I'm ok.
I'm so scared of going on medication as I've seen what it has done to other people in the same situation. 
I wish it was as easy as going for a walk or taking time for myself, because it's not. I don't want to do anything. It's like the saying you can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves . How do I want to help myself again?? 
From the outside you'd never know I was feeling this way because I'm so ashamed. 
I've gotten to the point of resentment I am convinced my husband is cheating on me, I can't help but go through his phone or constantly question his everyday actions or get mad when he doesn't answer my calls. I know on my heart has done nothing wrong so why am i doing this?? 
I hope that this was a safe enough place to put this, I'm just too embarrassed to discuss this anywhere or with any one else :(

Constantly looking for work and never getting interviews, cant seem to land any long term work and ive spent most of my time on the dole being broke since finishing highschool. I've been seeing a psychologist but doesn't seem to understand me, its very hard. Maybe my depression is affecting how i look for work?

I’m so alone and just don't know what to do. After a life of
ups and downs that I’ve prided myself on my resilience to get through but over
the past years I have had a horrible bullying experience at work that has
absolutely broken me. I used to be intelligent and strong but now I just want
to hide from life, I cry every day and feel so alone. I’m trying for another
job, but that's not proving a successful search, just another thing to keep
knocking me down. 

I cry in silence, I’m trying to be brave and hide how broken
I am from my family, but I don’t know how long I can keep this up. I don’t know
how to escape or break this horrible cycle I’m in. 

The worst thing is the effect this is having on my family.
My husband just wants to avoid all conflict/emotions/reality and says
everything is ok. He always has struggled with his own feelings and emotion due
to his shit childhood. I know he is like this but at the moment he goes for
days without talking to me or just leaves me crying my self to sleep and goes
to another room. I understand he doesn’t know what to do and how to handle me
but I really need him to be there for me now. I’ve tried to tell him but he
either doesn’t listen, doesn’t care or just doesn’t get it. 

I can’t handle him ignoring me anymore. It’s like he just
wants to take from me but won't give back. What is the use of being in a relationship
when you are not there for each other when you need it the most? 

I’ve been going to counselling for months. I asked him to see
a counsellor to deal with his own feelings - he had one appointment. I can’t
make him love me or care. I know he just wants me to “fix” everything and “tell
him” what to do. I need him to want me broken or not. I need him to want to
listen, try to understand and be there because he wants too. 

I know I’m hard to live with right now; I’m trying not to
be. I just don’t know I can keep putting up with my husband when he is not in
this for better or worse. And I don’t know how to deal with everything else,
these people from work are in my nightmares every night I don’t want to sleep,
I can’t sleep. Every day is such a struggle and I just don’t know how much more
I can take and I don’t know how to get out of this. I’m scared I’m lonely I
can’t be strong anymore.

I’ve been really curious about both my mental and emotional health lately. I don’t know whether i have depression or anxiety. I have completed the checklist and i’ve gotten high as the result but i’m not sure what to do. 

This has been going on since mid end last year till today. I’ve had complications with relationships, friendships and family. I  have tried finding multiple things that would make me happy for the specific issue but i dont think that has been the solution. I’ve also been distancing from both myself and people. I feel sad and depressed majority of the time. I often cry myself to sleep, overthink about both past and present issues. 

Physically, I’ve been having troubles sleeping, i don’t enjoy the things i usually enjoy/ lack of energy and I’ve stopped taking care of myself which have caused me both internal and external problems. 

Regarding school, i’ve been losing confience with that too. I’ve been skipping and i don’t know whether i will achieve what i want. I stress about getting things done. My grades have dropped a ton.

I don’t know who i can talk to, i’ve been losing self confidence. I have lost a lot of friends meaning i can not talk to anyone from school nor trust anyone to talk to. 
I want to tell my Mum what i’ve been going through and how we can perhaps solve the issue but i have two thoughts going on in my mind if i tell her. 1 being if i told her it would cause her more stress since she has severe depression. On the other hand, if i told her i keep thinking she wouldn’t be understanding and she might think im exaggerating because she’s always known me as that bright happy person i used to be. 
I don’t know whether this is depression or not since I’ve never experienced it. However if it is, what can i do?

I need to vent a little. I have bipolar and lets just say it’s absolutely horribe. I cant hold a job, i rely on centerlink, i rely on my mum and i feel like a stupid adult child. At the age of 19 i should be studying or working but im too useless to even do that. My 17 year old brother thrives at life. He has a great paying job, has just bought his first (very nice) car and has great friends and a great girlfriend. I cant even go outside without having a full blow panic attack. Im so useless at living. All i do is sit around all day and do nothing. Not because im lazy but because my brain is so fried from the multiple anti depressants/ anti psychotics/ mood stablisers ive been put on. My memory is horrible, i have very poor social skills, i cant concentrate on anything and heck i cant even drive anymore. Everyone else around me is constantly doing better and making sure i know theyre doing better than me. I shouldnt feel like im trapped in this never ending cycle of stupid crazy mania and crippling depression. All i want is a normal life like everyone else my age but instead im stuck feeling like a dumb child who constantly needs their nappy changed. Why does this illness have to take so much from me? All of my teenage years were spent extremely depressed and anxious and now im coming up to my 20s and i feel like its going to be the same old cycle. Im such a burden on everyone around me and ill probably be the only sibling still stuck at home living with their mum even though im the oldest. I hate being bipolar and as much as i try to accept it, it just takes so much away from my life. I cant do the things i want to do because im dirt poor and i dont ask my mum or brother for money because once again ill just look like that stupid adult child who cant get their life together. Im so tired of being looked down at for being lazy and useless. I dream about having a normal job and a normal life but its likely never going to happen and ill be that one kid who never left town after school and turned into deadbeat scum while everyone else moved and fulfilled their hopes and dreams. I hate what bipolar has done to me.

Hi everyone,
My life lately has gone from bad to worse, i as of late have no friends (due to cutting them all out after they spread my personal secrets and mocked me behind my back for years), a mother who ""hates"" me and cant wait for me to ""get out of her house"" (her words not mine), no extended family, flopping grades, no interest in anything, i struggle eating a whole plate of food, and constant exhaustion.
My family and i have never had a great relationship, now its just my younger sister, mother, and i. my mother gets angry a lot, and although she doesnt physically abuse me or anything like that, she leaves me feeling really bad about myself and i spend a lot of time crying in my room. I feel really stupid about everything, like logically i know lots of people have it worse but life just feels really bad at the moment and its like my life is going downhill rapidly.
I've tried self help guides, doing things that i use to love, tried meditating and running and that kinda stuff. none of it made me feel better. ive even tried the whole ""love yourself"" method of spending time with me and taking myself on adventures and stuff. It just makes me sad seeing everyone else with their friends and knowing i have nothing like that.
When i go to school everyones always making fun of me and pushing me over in corridors and kicking my face into my locker (that was my old best friend). I tried going to the councillor and he told me ""everyone has a right to feel safe at school"" and i was being paranoid. I dont struggle meeting new people but i feel the worlds against me.
Any advice would be great, i feel trapped in a bubble of sadness and i want to get out.
Thanks!

I've realised an issue.
I feel emotionless alot. I do have emotions. When I feel cry over something that doesn't have anything to do with me, I feel relief that I can feel emotions (so empathy). I used to be scared im a psychopath or something but that was irrational. I think i was 10 or 11 when I realised that it was a good idea to start like faking normal responses to stuff.

Some parts of my life don't feel completely real or like they feel like a haze. I just feel like im drifting. The word for it is ""indifferent"". I also feel like im rotting. I can't get anything done. My brain can't do basic maths, I have to consciously think about what my name is when I have to do x or y. I can't read anymore. My brain sees the words and doesn't like process them. Things dont go in one ear and out the other. They don't even go in. I can't really listen to thinks anymore. Can't focus either.

I do feel love and contentness and care about others. They're just stunted. Theyre not there all the time and I feel like I should be loving my family (my family have done nothing wrong) or caring about this but I just can't. But then I really admire my dad and think he's super cool.
I experience happiness but its vapid happiness if that makes any sense. I can laugh with my friends and still feel miserable and anxious. I know i'm living a double life but I don't know how to describe it. I am living a double life.
 
 
I have more to say but the word limit is stopping me so I'm just going to comment it or something idk

I know there is no perfect job for people like us but I am wondering if anyone out there has found a job that works for them, or at least that they can handle better than another.
I've been out of work for a year and am feeling stuck.

Hi, my boyfriend and I have been together about 18 months, however 8 of those have been spent long distance as I came to Australia for 10 months travelling whilst he stayed in England. We have had our ups and downs during this time as long distance is obviously very tough but we have pulled through as we know that soon we will be back together again.
However, recently he has started to feel incredibly down and not wanting to leave his room or shower or eat as much as he used to. We had a conversation yesterday that he feels the whole world is against him (he is currently taking exams at uni he feels very unprepared for, has had recent surgery on his knee so can't play rugby for 6 months and just generally misses me). He hasn't seeked professional help or spoken to a doctor but we both think it is likely that he is suffering some degree of depression.
I have suggested that he talks to someone at uni or his mum perhaps as maybe the physical conversation may help but he said he isn't ready to talk to anyone but me and even admitting his feelings to me is difficult for him. I also suggested writing his thoughts down just to help maybe try and organise them to work out exactly what's going on in his head (he says that he will often just burst into tears with no apparent cause) as a few years ago I experienced a similar thing triggered by exam stress and found that it really helped me.
I am struggling with what else to say to him as we are so far apart so I can't give my physical presence as support. It should hopefully be easier in 2 months time when I go home but until then, does anybody have any suggestions on where to go from here?

I'm not sure what to write, but I am sure it will come out when I type. 
I've been in a dark hole since my mothers demise; this was in 2012. It was very sudden death and in no way (at the time) I could predict it. I was at the stage of my life when I was finding myself as a teenager of 14~. I have had about six deaths of family and friends and it's gone to the point that I avoid being close to people--this is a conscious thing. 
This developed hatred, especially when people 'promised' to be there for you, but instead they use you or forget your existence. I avoid all dating and relationships because I fear they would hate me. I am now 22 and finally getting my life back together. I have been jobless since 2015, and luckily I have a family that endures me. 
For once in my life, I'm handing out resumes. I studied I.T and Networking in 2018 and my goal now is to study a degree in Computer Science. I'm incredibly self-conscious and I'm always thinking of failure and how pathetic I am. My knowledge of anxiety is that it's normal; balance is key, apparently. Anxiety [fight or flight] is normal with the evolution of Humans.
To counter this, I set up an experiment and say 'Yes' to most things I would say no to. The problem is, I still feel down, I feel pathetic because I have to do these experiments and that must affect my pride or something. 
Is this normal? Is there any other way to self-improve? I've been trying but it feels I'm not getting anywhere.

Hi..
I've been and gone on this site for many years now as I have suffered intermittant depression, anxiety and various other symptoms. I'm lost now. I've burned through a handful of psychiatrists, a larger handful of shrinks, and been on all sorts of medication. Have also had a stint in a private psych hospital last year for 'depression'.
Um, so I'm male, 35 and have had depression since my late teens. I've been on anti-depressants for years but it seems like my moods stablise for a while..then I go back to where I was.  I think the depression is a result of all my other problems, things that I've only started to notice, such as mood swings, anxiety . My current psych diagnosed me with an ""undetermined mood disorder"", I've been snapping at my partner for months for no reason, I've turned away the last remnants of my friend base and I really dislike social circles. I'm only just coping at work - I am in technical sales consultancy so need to act like an extrovert - and do - but it's all a scam. I'm empty, confused, agitated and lost inside, both professionally and personally. I sit at work and pretend to act busy because I am just sick of trying to create smalltalk with people.  Social situations scare me a little and I can't trust anyone and a lot of social interactions and building relationships with people doesnt make sense to me, I have felt like I was meant to be born on a different planet for most of my adult life.
I'm intermittantly more depressed and anxious at times than others. I have a really bad image of myself in my mind and cant shake it, I vomit some of what I eat up nearly every day because it feels so good afterward (the feeling of punishing myself) especially when I eat unhealthy stuff. My psychs (normal one and the one at the clinic) both know this and they havent done anything about it, they seem to think it's just a anxiety thing. 
Did I mention I have like, hardly any interests? I suppose that's a 'feature' of depression. I go to the gym and have been obsessing over property investing at the moment but that's it. I dont have any friends either to share these interests with, so do them myself. Its as if I don't even exist and I'm not sure I like it that way or not.  I keep thinking about myself at 60 looking back on my life and seeing what I could have done differently.  What little friends I do have that I do talk to are all on Facebook adn are in different cities, and for some reason they're all female (?).  I often have low (no) sex drive but occasionally get huge bursts of sex drive for some reason.
As I've got no friends or family to talk to about any of this stuff and I don't think my girlfriend/partner understands all of this really, here I am again. I sure as hell dont I just feel like I'm suffering and sick of it. Trapped is how I feel. And resigned. I can't stomach the thought of going back to my psychologist again so soon after dealing with one praticular subject to go around what I feel is like a huge cycle through my life again. I went to my psychiatrist recently and told him everything was great on my current med, and at that moment in time it seemed to be. I feel like a hypocondriac and a total waste of resources going to yet another different psychologist or doctor. Going to more of these people, or the same ones again, just doesn't seem to possibly achieve anything.  The power of positive thinking seems like a huge disillusionment right now.
I'm angry at the world for abandoning me and leaving me to fend for myself. I've been trying to communicate my feelings for years and it feels like nobody's interested in listening anymore. I thought I had dealt with issues about growing up an overweight, only child in a dysfunctional family with little support network and years of bullying but obviously I'm just coping, I haven't dealt with them, I want to burn down my old school and physically harm people from my early life. I wrote a horrible email to my old high school recently accusing them of not exerting a duty of care and turning  a blind eye for when I was at school. I have no idea what the poor person thought when they read. I've completely disconnected emotionally from my last immediate family member, my mother, and I dont know if its because I am blaming her deep down for that stuff or if I am angry for something else. I called her last weekend because it was Easter. It was the first time I had since Xmas.
Life with my partner is on ice. I feel like I cant live without her and cant decide whether I truly love her - I thought I did but really I dont think I know really what love is. She wants to have kids with me, I think she's mad but I'm going along with it anyway because secretly I am dying to have kids but I am absolutely terrified of bringing kids into this world and treating them the same way I was treated when I was little.
Suicide, you betchya. I fantasised it a lot last year and that's how I ended up at the clinic. Now I'm fantasising about it again.  And I feel trapped. I want to abandon everything in my life and run.. but I don't know where...or to what.

Hi,
This is my first time posting on the BB forum, so forgive me if I get something wrong.
I've had this problem for a while, but only recently has it singularly made my life difficult (usually it exists in combination with procrastination, sadness, self-isolation or something like that). I currently attend school and have enrolled in mostly difficult classes, which means that not only am I receiving more difficult work, I am also getting dramatically more out-of-school obligations than I've had previously. It's worth mentioning that every person I've asked has had trouble adjusting - the learning curve isn't unique to me, but the continued effects are.
I had to complete a fair amount of work over the weekend that had me working from 8am to 6pm with the inclusion of lengthy breaks to make sure I didn't totally burn out before I had everything done, which I nearly did. However, now I feel like I can't do anything at all, and was totally unable to focus during the day. I also feel that in general I am unable to do the same amount of work in a day as someone else (maybe I'd get half done). I don't want to quit any of my classes, and not completing the required work would earn me a detention and potentially being kicked out as well as put me behind, but I don't want to feel like this every Monday.
Is this a normal symptom of depression? What can I do to regain my energy? And do you have any other advice on how to manage my workload?

Interested to hear other people’s opinion on this.
After recently turning 30, for some reason it has prompted me to evaluate everything in my life. I have been struggling recently with depression, and fighting the need to go on medication after a negative experience. 
I have this overwhelming feeling that depression has and will waste the best years of my life. I can’t get motivated to do the things I want to do, and I don’t have the confidence to try new things.
I used to swim, play team sports, go out and meet new people. Now I’m terrified to do any of those things. I feel so sad that my depression has robbed me of that, and I feel like I will get old and be disappointed in my life because I haven’t done what I wanted to do. 
Has anyone had these feelings? I am consumed by these thoughts but do not have the willpower to change anything. I still want to sleep all day and I feel no joy from anything.
I hold down a full time job but I don’t enjoy it like I used to. I don’t try when I’m there because I just don’t care about anything anymore.
I went to a therapist and that did help a little but it’s very expensive and he wanted me to go every week. 
I don’t know what the answer is and I don’t know where to go from here.

Hi,
Depression & anxiety are taking their toll on me and more sadly my family.
I am always so negative and unhappy. I seem to ruin each and every moment lately. More sadly my kids are starting to get caught up in it.
My wife has always been so supportive, but after so many years of the same behaviours and situations I think I have finally used up all my chances of her forgiveness.
She now wants space, but I continue to keep trying to pull her tighter, which makes her push me away harder. I just look for affection from her at any opportunity (like holding hands in the car). I love her so much and would say I am obsessed with her. We are high school sweethearts and have been together for 20 years (married for 12).
I have struggled with this illness for many years. I am now on 3 different types of meds.
I have been told that I need to fix myself before I can fix our marriage problems, but I have it in my head that I just can’t be happy unless I fix my marriage problems first. My wife doesn’t want Marriage counselling until I sort myself out first, which my psychiatrist agrees with. 
How can I be happy in an unhappy marriage, but how can I have a happy marriage if I am unhappy ... they seem to go hand in hand ... I just want to be happy and to treat my wife and kids the way they deserve.
Would appreciate any advice, thanks!

I’ve been suffering for a while now and I thought I should try to seek help because I’ve always been too afraid. For about a year now I’ve been feeling an on and off sadness. It comes in waves. I’ll have the best day ever, and for some reason I’ll come home at night and cry myself to sleep. For a year now, there hasn’t been a week where I haven’t cried.
I don’t understand. I feel so guilty because I have a life most would kill for. A beautiful family who loves me. Friends that love me. A lovely home. And yes I’m grateful- so grateful. But for some reason, I absolutely hate myself. When I’m out with friends I forget about everything going on internally and I have the best time. But when I come home reality just comes back and I feel the sadness wash over me. 
I hate myself a lot. I feel like I won’t amount to anything in life. Everyday just has no meaning to me. The only reason I’m living is because I don’t want my family to suffer when I leave because I know they love me. I’m a very insecure person. Despite people telling me I’m beautiful, I feel that I’m so ugly. But it’s not just my self-confidence- I feel lost. I’ve lost motivation for things I enjoy and I can’t do my uni assignments without procrastinating till last minute. I feel that nothing is worth it anymore. 
Despite being in the normal weight range I feel extremely fat. And I’ve noticed that sometimes I won’t eat at all whilst other times I’ll overeat a lot. Ive been sleeping more. When I don’t have work or uni I’ll stay in bed till 12 and sometimes I’ll even nap later at night. I just feel so drained sometimes. Sometimes even while I’m having fun with friends, the wave will come over me and the sadness hits. I always hide it though because I don’t want my family or friends knowing because I feel that I’m a burden. People already have their own issues to deal with and I don’t want to add to that. That’s why I’m posting here. Although I’m still telling others, it doesn’t feel that real through the virtual world.

This is my first post and I’m scared to post here because I don’t know if I am depressed. I’m currently 22 but this has been a question I’ve asked myself since the beginning of high school.
When I was 13/14, I noticed that I would get this empty feeling in my stomach and/or a heavy feeling on my chest where it would feel difficulty to breath. I realised that I didn’t care if I lived or not but would never self harm because I couldn’t put the people I love through that. This didn’t occur often, it wasn’t constant, maybe for a couple of hours every month or two (maybe more, I don’t recall) and because of that I thought I would be fine and that it will past. And it kind of did.
The feeling would sometimes creep up, but it never lasted long. Nothing in particular would trigger it, sometimes I would wake up and feel empty. Sometimes in the middle of doing something I would feel empty. But as I’ve gotten older, gotten more responsibility, I’ve gotten better at distracting myself from it. Until today which has been the most intense and longest I’ve felt this way (past the couple of hours mark which I know still isn’t much). And I realised something, I can’t talk to anyone I know about it. 
I have tried before and I tried talking to my boyfriend about it today. But every time the idea or thought of me being depressed is brought up, my mind begins to trivialise it. Oh I’m not depressed, I just get sad sometimes, stop being dramatic. And I push it away until the emptiness comes back again. 
The thought that my life is meaningless from when I was a teen never went away. Like I said, I would never do anything intentionally but I don’t think I would be happy or sad if I wasn’t here anymore. 
But at the end of the day I don’t know if I’m just really sad sometimes and I worry that if I do talk about it I will seem dramatic and trying to make a victim of myself or trying to seek attention because I’m not actually depressed. Ironically I’m also scared that if I talk about it to someone I know and they believe that I am depressed, they will try to help me and I don’t know if I’m ready for that either.
Im sorry if I wasted anyone’s time (especially if I’m right that I’m just sad and not depressed) but at least typing this long thread up has distracted me from the emptiness a bit. Also thank you to anyone who actually reads through this full thing...

Hi
I am about to undergo an assessment for whole person impairment as part of my work cover compensation case. I ve been told I need to be classified as 30% impaired and that this is difficult. My injury is psychiatric and I'm in Victoria. Has anyone been through this?

I just need someone to talk to. I am struggling emotionally
with a lot of things right now.

I am in a long term relationship with someone (12 years) but
I feel as if our relationship is falling apart. I don’t know whether to stay
and try to fix things or leave. Either option will be equally hard. My partner
has OCD and other ongoing mental health problems and I feel he takes them out
on me. He can be rude, condescending and verbally aggressive when he gets upset
about extremely trivial things. Things have been slowly getting worse and worse
and I can’t cope. I’ve tried for a long time to be supportive but I’m at my
breaking point. 

I still love him, I really do, but he always make me happy.
Sometimes when I’m coming home from work, I get a sinking feeling in my
stomach, fearing what kind of mood he will be in. Sometimes we have a nice
evening together and get along great. Other times, the smallest and stupidest
things will set off a fight between us. 

I have terrible self esteem which is why I find it hard to
stand up to my partner. I literally hate myself. I wish I could be anyone else.
I despise the way I look. When I look in the mirror, I see the world’s ugliest
face staring back. I hate that I wasn’t born an attractive, confident, happy
person. This is why I think I tolerate his behaviour towards me. 

I just can’t find the strength to confront my partner to
tell him that either things need to change or that I might consider leaving
him. 

I am seeing a physiologist and so is he (separately) but we can only have
a session every 3 weeks or so to be able to claim the Centrelink gap benefit.
Everything seems so hopeless. Counselling is so expensive and I feel we need
more of it. I want us to go to joint counseling so we can sort our issues out together. 

I need help. I need support. But I feel like I’m on my own. If
I turn to friends and family, they will make judgements about our relationship
and I can’t trust any of them not to say anything to my partner. 

Please I just need someone who is a stranger to talk to.

I think I beginning to get depressed. In the past I have only had small periods of depression but this has lasted a while now. I nothing is helping me. I feel like I have this empty pit inside of me and I don't know how to fix it. I am too scared to talk to any of my family and friends about because I don't feel a care trust anyone enough to talk to them. I am not afraid to admit to myself that I need help, I am afraid to admit it to the ones I care about. I don't want them to worry about it, by I know if I want help, I am going to talk to them about it. How do you tell someone that you are feeling depressed almost all of the time and nothing can bring you out of it?

Hi all,
 
This is my first time posting because I am having issues with everyday life and I think I may be on the verge of going back to a very dark space. I am 43, married for 22 years and I had depression for approximately 18 months. It started as a small change but by the middle of last year I was a different person. In December my beautiful wife, who stop by me through all this, along with a few mates took some action. I finally recognized that I needed help and began the road to recovery. It has been some hard work but I have really invested in myself and learning what makes the the mind tick and where certain behavioral patterns come from. Over the last 3-4 weeks my life has been the best it has been, my marriage has been the best it has ever been and things were going great. Then my wife, in a caring way, said I was smothering her somewhat (very justified). Well, after opening up to her and telling her all about my emotions, thoughts and some things I had kept from her, this came as a bit of a slap in the face. Now, over the last few days we have been arguing. I am over analyzing everything she say's or doesn't say looking for validation that she loves me. I am stricken with guilt for what I put her through and scared I will loose her. I slip back to old behaviors and she straight away get angry and yells at me. I feel she should be a bit more understanding and help work me out of it. Now I feel alone, mad and sorry for what I am doing. I feel like I am good for no one and just make things harder for the people I love. For the first real time, deep down, I feel I don't deserve to be here anymore. Am I broken?

First time here and not very good at talking about my feelings. For the last 6 weeks or so i have been feeling extremely down about my self. I feel worthless . Depressed. Sad and tired. I feel that the world is out to get me and the walls are closing in on me. I constantly have anxiety attacks and break downs.

Hello community
I've been in many relationships over the years and have always struggled with the same problem, whenever I slightly dip into a depression, I want to reject my partner, I see all the problems with the relationship and make up problems with her that I wouldn't normally do in my well self. I'm in a relationship at the moment and it has been going really well, except I can't stop the feeling of rejection when I'm feeling low. I love her deeply, but right now I just don't feel attracted to her. I found a YouTube vlogger who spoke of a similar thing happening to her, so I feel like I might not be alone. 
 
Does anyone have any advice or have experienced these kinds of feelings. I've dipped like this once in our relationship and it took until the depression had lifted for me to be able to clearly see her and love her for who she is. Is there anyone in this community suffer with similar symptoms.
 
Thanks
 
Alex

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 5 years ago, however have been managing it really well over the past 2 years. In jan of this year, my mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer. This was obviously devastating news but I felt like I had been managing it well. Lately, I've been having issues with some of my friends and have been feeling really alone and isolated. I'm always stressed about money and work, so much so that the ""stressed"" feeling feels like numbness. Over the past two weeks I've been feeling down and haven't been able to pull myself out. I feel like I'm relapsing. I've been trying to do things that I know clear my head or make me feel good (self-care), but nothing seems to get me back on track. Uni is really busy at the moment and I have placement coming up soon - I'm scared to graduate next year but it's really important to me that I do because it might be the only milestone my mum will be here for... I used to love going to work but now its a place that just brings so many negative (the friends I've had issues with work with me too). I always feel so hurt and upset over small things. For eg. three of my friends (who i don't have issues with) went out together tonight and didn't invite me, and I feel so incredibly sad and left out and like these girls don't like me anymore - even though I know I'm probably overthinking it. I have the most amazing boyfriend, but I just find myself getting mad and short with him when he's done nothing but try to love and care for me. I feel like I'm lying to my parents by saying that I'm fine. I feel guilty because I feel like this unshifting feeling of sadness has nothing to do with my mum being sick, even though thats the biggest and most important thing to be sad about. I feel like big traumatic things that I've been through are slowly accumulating and I don't know how to cope with my feelings anymore. I don't know how to ask for help or if I even want it. I feel alone and like no one understands. I feel overwhelmed and exhausted. I'm just feeling really lost at the moment.

Hi all,
This is my first post on any forum and regardless of the anonymity it is still daunting. 
i was diagnosed with BPD when I was 18, prior to that i was misdiagnosed as depression and nothing more. I went through self destructive teenage years with no one to blame but myself. The example of traits of BPD, I recognised all of them. I exhibited traits such as promiscuity, drug abuse and the inability to form healthy relationships. I have a chronic fear of abandonment that has controlled my life in suffocating ways. I have progressed to the stage where I have a semi healthy relationship, we have been through hell. He has a child and an ex wife. It is extremely difficult to manage this with an abandonment trait. I am a trainee accountant I work full time, I attend uni, I am in a business partnership with my partner. But I sit here in my car in child’s pose incapable of getting out of the car because a slight argument turns into a breakup.. again. I have the pain in my head and the cry of someone grieving when realistically I love my life the day before and the next I want this to stop. I am not suicidal, I love my life. I am my own enemy. Today I can’t breathe, I feel impossible to manage. I feel incompetent of life and incapable of letting go of my insecurities which control my life.
i guess I don’t feel I need advice, I’ve attended enough therapy to understand coping mechanisms. I guess relatability can be something that therapy can’t fix. I guess someone, anyone out there who can relate. I’d love to hear from you. Not because I’m glad you are in the same position. But to know im not as alone as I think I am.
i hope everyone has a lovely night and realise the beauty within the struggle.

...I'm not sure exactly how to start or where to begin. I'm at a place in my life where I am completely lost and feeling worthless. 
Hi all, this is my first time posting and reaching out on an online forum. I'm 26 and currently my depression is becoming hard to deal with. I feel empty. I've lost interest in all the things I use to love: reading, writing, cooking, music. I even find it difficult to sit and watch a tv series these days. I have already reached out to my GP who referred me to a psychologist, however, financially I just can't afford it anymore (I've only attended 2 sessions). I've reach out to my psychologist with this issue and she has offered to only charge me a concession fee, which is amazing, however I still just can't afford it (the rebate simply just takes too long to get back to me). 
I have next to no friends any more, my family are going through a hard time financially and emotionally. My father already suffers chronic depression (due to a broken back) and my mum is always stressed. I haven't told either of them about my issues or that I was even seeing a psychologist. I've lost contact with my best friend due to our changing lives. She just had a baby and our relationship has suffered greatly due to a number of issues that have occurred in the last year. My dog passed away a year ago, and things have just never been the same. And, I know a lot of people may not understand but losing my dog was harder than losing my best friend - because he was my best friend (I was definitely that weird girl that had next to no friends and preferred to hang out with her dog). 
My boyfriend recently bought a cafe and so has little time these days. He says he wants to help me but doesn't seem to be acting on those words. I think he really does want to help me but doesn't know how, and I don't know how to tell him what I need. I don't even know what I need. 
I start uni in a few weeks, a bachelor in events management. I was excited when I first applied and received my acceptance letter, however I've gone back to feeling nothing toward it. I feel alone and unimportant. I find it hard to think positively about what uni has to offer me (education, career opportunities, friendships, etc) and instead find myself thinking I am unlikable and too old for uni, and worry I will continue to have no friends or life goals.   
I apologize now for the long post but I really just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks.

Hey it's my first time posting on this kind of forum so please bear with me.
For the past few years, i've been in a really crappy mental space because of a break up of a really meaningful relationship to me. I basically dropped my whole life after that, didnt go work barely went to uni at all because I was scared of facing him and couldn't bring up the energy to do anything after. Even though we had both agreed on being friends afterwards, it seemed like he found it really hard to talk to me as we used to, and I tried to stay optimistic because I felt like even if I had lost the relationship I really didn't want to lose that connection/friendship we had had. It was important to me because he got me through the first couple of years of being lonely at uni, and was a huge pillar of support, and it was also really hard to find someone at uni you could connect with that well. Right now, I know that what I feel isn't that I want to get back together, it's that we could still have an easy conversation as friends and talk about most things like before.
I tried texting and asking questions after that constantly and even felt really ashamed that I was doing so when he clearly seemed like he didn't want to talk.i hated myself for being that type of person who'd have no self respect or control and just keep texting even though he'd ignore me most of the time, and asked myself why I was being so masochistic, but I just couldn't stop myself. I only got through the last few years because he would still occasionally answer and that gave me affirmation that I could still talk to him. I've spoken with my friend about this and we've both agreed that I should lessen how much I text because it's really affecting my mood and making me really down. Please let me know if anyone has gone through the same experience. I want to stop feeling so alone, hurt and exhausted every day, as it's also affecting my other relationships with people.

Hi, I am new here. I have lived with depression for decades and have been on medication for the past 15 years. I work in the health industry and have worked in the mental health sector in the past. I am reaching out because I feel I have run out of options. Every single aspect of my life is problematic. My financial situation is stressful, my current work is monotonous, my teen child needs me to be strong as he has both physical & mental health issues, I have no interest in socialising, my partner doesn't understand and isn't really supportive; he also doesn't lift a finger around the house, I am constantly tired. I feel that I need everything to stop so I can just rest. I have had ad hoc time off work this year (and I only work part time) and if I keep it up I won't have a job to go back to. I feel chained to my desk and computer and I clock watch all day until I can get out of that office. To add insult to injury, the commute is over an hour each way. Work will be relocating very soon so that commute will increase to 2 hours each way. Boss is a true workaholic and does not take kindly to people having time off. I have had debt since splitting from my husband almost a decade ago and I need to work to pay it off. I have actually decided to sell my home in order to clear all my debt because I can no longer manage the stress of it. I have applied for a few jobs but have found that I am overlooked these days due to my age, despite the fact I am more than qualified. Truth is, I need time out from work. I have worked in the health sector for more than 30 years and I am completely & utterly worn out. I can't manage any of this anymore but can't afford time out. I don't know what to do. I have seen numerous psychologists in the past but nothing is actually helping me to cope day to day. I have lived with so much stress for so many years but I now feel like I am really buckling under the weight of it all.

so long story short after years of displaying bipolar-like symptoms I saw a doctor who brought up bipolar and who referred me to a psychiatrist who assessed me. at the time I had thought the psych focusing on my gender but later was accidentally given a copy of his assessment and found that he had indeed been assessing me for bipolar and had found it very likely that I was ‘in the prodormal stages of a bipolar-like illness’. the symptoms have only increased over the year since then, with hypomanic episodes fairly uncommon at three-six proper ones a year seeming to be my standard, but that’s kind of irrelevant I think. I’m on medication for bipolar but due to an unhelpful accusatory doctor I don’t believe I’m at a therapeutic level yet.
without going into too much detail, I was stuck with a very unsupportive shrink for some time who insisted I was an unreliable attention seeker, and now I find myself in the adult world wondering if I’m even supposed to try and have professional validity in the form of actual diagnosis anymore. I feel a crushing need to be able to ‘prove’ what’s wrong with me, and to have the validity to fall back on rather than my current spiral of “nothing is wrong and you’re just being an idiot”. It seems to me that there is overwhelming evidence including a psychiatric assessment pointing to a valid diagnosis being possible but now I’m so turned around by the bad shrink that I just don’t know what to do. I can’t even feel comfortable referring to my hypomanic episodes as such even though that’s exactly what they are, simply because I feel like I need professional validation. 
 
What are your takes on this? Is it even worth trying to get this confirmed? Most of the time I don’t even care cause I just feel like trash and expect nothing to matter, but other times I just burn with the need to be able to say “This is what’s causing these behaviours, and I can prove it,”.

And it’s not like I haven’t tried to or don’t try to create meaning in my life. I’m about to finish my master’s degree, I have a job in my field even before graduating, I have friends and family that care about me but I just see no point to any of it anymore? 
I’ve had cyclical bouts of depression all my life but this time around it seems to be the the worst. I got better and discontinued therapy but am finding myself going back to see a counsellor this week it feels neverending. 
I guess I’m just getting my feelings of my chest cos frankly I don’t think any of my friends understand or can relate. I genuinely think the world is going to shit. There are things that bring me immense joy and I try to submerge myself in them as much as I like for example, astronomy, live music and reading. But on a social level I just feel empty like I cannot connect with anyone and even if I do there are things I may judge them for because they feel like a product of what this world has become.
Hookup culture for example, I’m nowhere ready for a serious relationship because I want to heal from past wounds and better manage my depression. But it just makes me sad how people have become disposable. You see how rampant the use of online dating sites is in my age group and it just makes me sad there’s nothing real or of substance anymore. It literally feels like shopping for people, like people are just objects to swipe right or left on, their value and worth based on their appearance. And you give up so easily on somebody because there’ll be 10 others you can find with the tap of your thumb. 
I guess I’m just rambling. I feel like I have no one to talk to who’ll understand and I don’t want to burden anyone but I need to focus on my assignments for uni so just thought I’d clear my head until it’s time to discuss this more with my counsellor in person. Thank you to anyone who’s read this so far.

Here in middle age I realise that I’ve been depressed, on and off but always lingering somewhere in the background, for more than 30 years.
I have been able to access psychologists, psychiatrists, councillors, CBT courses etc not just here in Australia but also in big teaching hospitals in the US and Canada while I was working there, and also in Western Europe at various times. Whatever help has been available I’ve tried. 
I’ve been on various antidepressants for many of those years. 
Here I still am, unable to see how to make life bearable despite having an amazing job that allows me a huge amount of creative freedom, a very loving and supportive partner who would do anything to help me feel better, no money worries, a beautiful house etc 
I have grown to hate the adverts and campaigns to ask for help, because for me it just hasn’t helped, so when I see those I feel like I’m beyond hope. 
My GP is great but having sent me to 3 or 4 different specialists (psychs etc) I feel that I’m exhausting possibilities. I go to each one so hopeful, so ready to try damn well anything to feel better. I never do. 
I do know that depression runs in my family. And it’s a curse. And I feel that mine is getting worse as I get older.
I just feel broken.

How do you keep going when you feel completely directionless, alone, and exhausted by everything going on in life? No self-care strategy is working, and no professionals I've spoken to have actually been helpful. I often feel like my mental health is so complex, that no professional is really equipped to properly support me - currently waiting for an appointment with a psychiatrist, but any tips welcome (that are unlikely to have already been tried) xo

I feel as if I'm turning into the person I've always feared. One who feels as if they cannot ever be the best version of themselves. All I feel like I'm doing is hurting the one I love because I become so insecure. My flaws create me to become so defensive, so defensive that I begin to take out my anger on others with vocally. I want to be better, there's no doubt about that. I want to not lose my temper. I just keep crying at night, hating myself for who I am and what I can become. I always try to be helpful to my friends and be kind, but there's always this hidden part of me that can come out and I want it to go away. I need help and advice on how to change. I don't want to be the person who lets there insecurities hurt others. I need to find out ways that I can better myself and not get sad, angry and jealous in a romantic relationship. I just want to find ways to also feel a greater amount of self love and to learn how to handle more situations calmly in the moment, rather than exploding. Thank you for reading.

I don’t know what to do anymore, I can’t make friends or relationships. Everyday it is becoming harder to go to work and the gym because I don’t know what I’m doing it for. 
Im finding it hard to enjoy things anymore and struggle to leave the house. 
I wish someone would just show me what to do to feel good again.

I sit at home and play video games all day or go to the gym or walk the dogs. 
I do nothing else, not by choice. All my friends never have time for me, never invite me to things. 
Im terrible at social connections now, even with people I call my friends I never feel like I can connect. 
Im depressed, everything I try and do be it friends, relationship or work blows up in my face. I don’t see why I bother anymore and maybe that’s why I don’t try anymore. 
im a disappointment to my parents, I’ve achieved nothing in the time since I left school and things have only gotten worse since then. 
Now nothing makes me happy, I have no one to talk too. I don’t know what to do anymore, it’s been so long and im just tired of it all.

I am 46 and have long dealt with depression and anxiety, I have been separated for 2 and a half years now and have been managing well, I have a good job I enjoy although am quite a bit older than my colleagues, and although they are lovely this can feel very isolating at times. I thought I was doing better after my separation and have been on a couple of dating sites but remove myself shortly afterwards because it is a blow to my self esteem. Last night I went out with some drinks with a friend and ended up inviting a man in his 20s who I had been chatting to on a dating site to my apartment. I thought it was flattering for someone to tell me I am sexy. I ended up having sex with this much younger person who I don’t even know, which is out of character for me, my little apartment has been my sanctuary since my separation and I don’t let many people in here, which is why I feel so ridiculous and bereft. I know this person is not unsafe and have respectfully asked that he does not contact me again. I feel like a pathetic, middle age woman and I am so ashamed and embarrassed. I don’t want to leave my apartment today, I don’t want the world to see my face. I feel so alone, I thought I was doing well but this feels like an absolute low point that I am not sure how to move on from. I have managed to shower and absolutely had to put fresh sheets on my bed. I know I need to avoid alcohol, I think I’d be too ashamed to even tell this to my counsellor. Does this happen to other people?

For the past 3 years I've had some depressive symptoms but I don't know if I actually have it. Those symptoms are:
1) It's hard to get out of bed in the morning 
(because I dread school, I have undiagnosed S.A.D. and I'm always at the library by myself because of this crippling social phobia)
2) I cry sometimes at night
3) Sometimes I'd want to be dead for a day to see if anyone really cares
4) I get angry/fustrated over small things sometimes (apparently that's a symptom of depression)
5) Feeling demotivated at school
6) I'm kept awake at night thinking of why I'm the way I am and other stuff
But also I still get enjoyment from music and video games. And my weight is normal, I think.
 
Also am I doomed to be homeless if I make it to 18 because I'll be too socially anxious to get a job? Because I'm 15, and my S.A.D. has only been getting worse. The future doesn't look too bright, even though my grades are pretty good. :c

I have not been diagnosed with any mental health disorders but I think there's something wrong with me. I've been going through a really tough time lately and recently its been getting a lot worse. I want to get help but I can't do that without talking to my parents and I really don't want to. I don't have a very close relationship with my parents (or anyone in my family really) and I feel like I can't trust them and that they won't understand what I'm going through (whatever that is). I don't talk to be friends about this stuff either because I don't want to be a burden to them. I can't get anything done because I can never focus and I don't get much sleep, this is causing me to fall behind in school. this causes more tension with my parents and family and makes me feel inadequate compared to my friends as they are so much smarter than me. this forum is kind of a last resort for me and I would normally never do something like this but I just want to feel happy again, without having to actually talk to someone. sorry for how messy this, this is more a vent of my feelings

All I feel is apathy now. 
Sadness used to consume every waking moment of my life (along with loneliness) but now I feel nothing at all.
I would rather feel sad and live with the pain of it than live in a constant state of apathy.
Because at least it WAS is something. Instead of being nothing.

Hi, 

This is my first time posting. 
I guess I am just venting what I am currently dealing with
I am not sure how much information I am suppose to provide 
( I have a tendency to ""overshare"" with detail)

I am 27 and was recently diagnosed with ASD.
I have also just recently had a kidney transplant ~6 months ago.
I am so grateful to be given a second chance at life but I haven't had the chance to live that yet.
There has been ongoing complications that just haven't stopped since 
It's gotten to the point that I don't really feel ""human"" anymore.
I am typing this from my bed in the transplant ward.
I have lost count at the amount of admissions I have had.
This place feels more like home to me then the outside world.
On-top of all of that I am also confused about my relationship with my partner.
I'm not sure if I can objectively make informed choices on his behaviour when I have a deficiet in social communication.
It seems like when I say things (maybe i do play a role) I say them objectively without emotion intended.
He takes them the wrong way and reacts emotionally saying not nice things to in return.
Lately I have noticed the words he has said before have been replaying over in my head.
I have tried many times to explain to him that I wasn't attacking him to point where I feel shaky.
My brain just can't come up with other words to explain things so he understands.

I have a special interest in chemistry,kidneys, the human body and the ""connection"" between those topics.
I have been pursuing a science degree whilst waiting for my transplant.
The thing I was the most excited about was going back to uni and being well enough to basically ""shout it from the rooftops"" how much I just love that stuff. I did go back for 2 weeks before being hospitalized again.
The feeling just wasn't mutual I wasn't able to talk about my interests and when I did I was shut down.
It feels like everything that has happened has affected my self confidence.
I don't have much support and this is the first time I have been able to just get it all of my chest 

Thank you for listening =) 
Jess.

Hi guys, 

Need some help and advice not sure if this is the correct forum but oh well at least I'm doing it.

I have struggled on and off with Depression/Anxiety my whole life and lost my Dad and Job about 5 years ago and was off work for about 2 years and was good for a while and working again but then last year lost my job and was bullied at work last Sept and had a breakdown and went on centerlink for the past 6 months with medicla certificates, lost my cousin on Christmas Day who I was close with and helped me get through the death of my father and have had trouble dealing with as well. Centerlink knocked back another 3 months from my doctor and I met with the pscolgyst at Centrelink and she gave me another 4 months of not having to look for work to try and get better. This was a month ago and i saw an email from centerlink a couple of weeks ago that I have to do upto 8 hrs a week and I crashed and went in deep depression and couldnt deal with it and havnt spoken to centrelink and now I am freaking out that they are going to cut me off as i havnt done anything and can't bring myself to call or go in and see them. I have an appointment with them next wed and im freaking out that they are going to cut me off. Should I go in and see the Social Worker who I spoke with before or wait until the appointment. Don't know what to do. If I get cutt off I don't know what ill do. 

Help please?

Hi all,
I’ve been in touch with beyondblue (via phone and chat services) since November 2017 when I was initially diagnosed with Melancholic Depression and Anxiety. I’ve been living with this mental illness for more than 2 years now. 
In the initial stage, I was not even aware that I’m suffering from something known as “Depression”. Being an International student in Australia, I always missed my family and childhood friends but managed to focus on my career. I always kept myself busy in something or another that may be studying, networking, socializing, yoga, dancing, etc. I wanted to do as much as I can until I assure myself that I’m worth of something in my life.
After first year of uni, my body slowed down and with time I came to a position where I was not able to get up from bed (not able to brush my teeth also, still pushed every bit of my energy),  started withdrawing from my friends, lost control over my actions and felt like complete stranger in my head. I extended one semester, lost all close friends and just kept on crying and beating myself every single day.
Till date, I don’t know whether I’m worth something or not. The more I do the less I feel I can do. I’m still guilty of losing friends and wasting time lying on bed doing nothing. Every morning still feels fake and I’m working hard to fill that inner void within myself.
Now, I’m a graduate and have a full time job. I’m studying for professional qualifications simultaneously. I do visit GP & Clinical Psychologist whenever I can. Every single day, I apply make up and get out of the house with a lump in my throat and with few questions “Will I ever meet the genuine me?” AND “Will there be a day when I’ll feel fulfilled from inside?”.
I’m still finding answers to above questions but what I know for sure is I’m much more stronger than I was before. But, will I remain the same forever is something I’m learning everday. But, what I know for sure is “No matter what happened today, I made progress”.

Hi folks,
New to these forums. I just went back on antidepressants last night after 10 years of being off of them. My school studies are getting the best of me and I have self doubt about my abilities. It snowballs and then I simply cant think or study anymore. It really brings me down.
So, last night I took my antidepressant and a melatonin sleeping pill as prescribed by my GP. I went to sleep at 10 pm and was wide awake at 2 am and never slept after. I had sweats and dry heaved in the toilet at 4 am. I woke up fidgety and my teeth were chattering. Also, my face was twitching when I tried to smile. Anyone else experienced any of these symptoms before?
Cheers

HI,
I was diagnosed with bpd in 2014.Since then I have been in denial about it and the impact it has on me. There's so many symptoms in the criteria that I felt like anyone could fit into that. I now understand that others may fall into the same symptoms but it may not affect their lives and how they function, like it does me. 
All in all, researching this and seeing how I may be perceived by doctors and family and friends makes me feeling so alone and evil. I feel like people think I'm some crazy, psychopath/ sociopath. I honestly feel like a monster. And that people are just being fake polite to me. I don't know what to do.

Hi everyone
are there anyone out there who have BPD (I don’t want to say ‘suffer from’ BPD) who have trouble with extreme reactions and how do you manage these?
it happens to me off and on but I don’t really have a strategy that works for me to deal with it, except try to just ride there feeling out which isn’t really much of a strategy. 
usually with me it’s in reaction to something that happens or someone says and my reaction is anger or sadness. I cry or I want to yell at the person.
thanks everyone :)

Hi
i have a long history with depression.  Long term medication and psychology.   As is the case with depression.   I get better, then it rears it’s ugly head again. 
I’m currently having an exacerbation of my depression.  Usual symptoms.  Poor sleep.  Anxiety.  Moody. Reduced capacity to make decisions.  
In the past I’ve had significant lows with the depression.  And while I’m not there at this point.  However I’m terrified I will get back to being that bad.   And I just don’t know if I have it in me to fight my way back out of it again.   I feel like fighting back is futile.   To get well.  Only to slip back to depression again after a while.   How do I face a lifetime of knowing this feeling of feeling so bad will come back around?

I understand that this may not be a post you would read usually but I have the exact same issue because I feel that it’s harder to explain this feeling when there isn’t many relatable posts to feel better about. 
Im young and a very career driven individual who always hides the real feelings of being short. I always tend to act normal by distracting myself but the real story is that I’m tired of being alone. 
I’m about 5,1 and 23 years old. it’s imposible to find a significant other because, as we always see in social media “girls love tall guys”. 
I treat and respect women well always because they always have me as that work best friend but it’s never more than that. 
To me, my height makes me unattractive to women. I feel that a women wouldn’t want to be seen with a shorter man. Not being able to find someone to care about puts me to a very lonely situation that always is depressing to me. 
I’ve accepted the fact that I’m short and tried to move on but it’s always at the back of my head bothering me, more than it should. 
Im constantly wishing that I was reborn as the same person but taller. The feeling of Being lonely is something that I’m tired of feeling. Those dream of having a perfect life to share with someone else has become a dream that’s impossible to have. 
I only wish to have a happier life!

Is there somewhere I can connect or talk to as I have no idea and am getting worse I know. Does anyone else experience this and get thru it all. I know I'm rambling. There is just so much pain and lonelyness since my mum who I nursed for yrs passed away. I lost contact with everyone.  Hence now isolation and loneliness come with not wanting to get up and function. Im  not eating or sleeping. I'm hiding from life and yet need to get things done or I'll end up homeless. 
I'll stop rambling. Please is there anyone who knows where I can get help or hear of positive outcomes

Hi,
I’m new here, but I’m looking for some support in regards to lying. Ever since I was young I had a brother whom was addicted to meth and myself and my family were constantly belittled and abused verbally. I learnt to lie about everything just so it wouldn’t trigger my brother because he was a ticking time bomb and would go into rage for the smallest things, the problem is it’s continued into my adult hood and I now lie to make things seem better than they are or so I don’t get the wrong reaction out of someone. My partner is constantly frustrated because he will ask if I used something of his and if I have I say no anyway because I’m scared of the reaction (not that he reacts) and he just says “just don’t lie it’s not hard” but I honestly can’t help it, I never tell big lies just little lies but honestly I just don’t know how to stop. I’ve never spoken to someone about my problems, I have anxiety and depression also which I’m on medication for and I feel like I’m trying to hold up this persona of being so happy and bubbly that I almost think I believe it myself. I don’t even know where to start, I’m 24 and I’ve never seen someone or spoken to a professional for the hell I went through as a child/teenager and I think it’s effected everything in my life- help me

Hi all
I think I might have CFS, however I'm not entirely sure as it's never been diagnosed by a doctor. The closest I've been to a diagnosis was around 2 years ago when I was told that my medication was creating ""CFS like symptoms"" by my GP, however he never provided any more advice on what to do about it. I changed GPs and medications not long after that and felt OK for a few months. Then the fatigue hit again. I haven't felt 'right' since Christmas last year. Sometimes I feel good for weeks but most of the time I'm tired, aching (muscles and joints that feel like they are about to explode), confused/foggy and I feel worse after exercise, even just a 30 minute walk. I tried a gym trial the other day and after 15 minutes of lifting light weights I was done. It took me 3 days to stop aching and feeling tired.
A year ago I could ride my bike to and from work (15km each way) most days, easily do a couple of hours of yoga a week, walk for 60+ minutes and hike for a couple of hours. Now I'm lucky if I manage a 20 minute slow walk. I try my best to do an hour of hatha yoga once a week but sometimes I'm just in too much pain and too exhausted. Most of my days consist of coming to work via bus and train, then going home and collapsing on the couch. I'm depressed, grieving for who I used to be and intensely jealous of anyone in good health. I've gained 8kg since I started feeling like this.
I have bought up the fatigue and pain with my doctor three times now. This usually results in my iron, vitamins and thyroid being checked (always normal) and being sent to the psychologist. My psychologist says I'm depressed but what if that's only because I have this fatigue and near constant pain? I also get monthly migraines which don't help me. I try my hardest not to dwell on my health, I use relaxation techniques and don't push myself anymore but I'm steadily feeling worse and worse.
So what do you do when you have little/no support from your GP, or for that matter anyone else in your life? Whenever I try to talk to family and friends I'm met with sympathetic comments then just awkward silences or a change of subject. I'm beginning to think everyone (including my GP) thinks I'm a hypochondriac. I'm suffering here, I WANT to be healthy, active and fit, I WANT help but I don't know how to get it or who to talk to about it.
:-(

Hi

This is my first time posting something like this. I normally keep to myself about everything but lately I'm finding it hard to deal with things. I'm 27 and when I look at my life I can't really say I have achieved much. Both my parents are sick(especially my mum. She's on dialysis) I'm also dealing with my own health issues( Lupus SLE) 

I used to work when I was younger but I don't anymore. I spend most my days waking up, watching TV and trying not to fall asleep during the day. I don't get out or have any friends. I've tried in the past to make friends but I get stressed and just ruin everything. I have a partner but she lives in another state and is also dealing with her own anxieties and depression. 

Lately It's been getting harder too deal with everything. I'm constantly feeling alone but I'm always surrounded by loved ones. I just don't ever feel like being near people and I'm constantly shutting myself off from everyone and everything. I find it extremely hard to show emotions with anything and I'm always too tired or in to much pain to go out and do anything. I just hate everything for no reason. I have no motivation for anything and I don't have anyone I can talk to. I've seen a psychologist and yes she helped a little bit but it wasn't enough.

Anyway. I wasn't feeling great and needed somewhere I could share my worries.

Thanks

Hi I would love to hear how different people deal with irritability either medication induced, like when you start a new medication and it worsens your mood or just irritability caused by depression/anxiety symptoms on their own or a combination which can be fun aswell hah. I use music and other distractions but would love to hear from others. Cheers

Hi,
I have been struggling with depression for a few years, but lately it's gotten so so much worse. To the point where I don't know if anything is really worth it anymore. I'm in pain all the time and I just want everything to stop for a while.
I feel like I really need someone to talk to. And so I have this friend who knows about my depression and is super supportive of me and is just great. But we don't talk much and when we do I feel like it's usually about how I am and how things are going for me. I feel really really guilty about this and so I started to just lie to him and tell him I'm fine, then at least he won't be worrying about me and he'll be okay. But he can tell when I'm lying and I feel like I'm just making him feel bad about it. 
I also don't want to burden him with all my problems and just drag him down. I don't know what to do. But if I don't talk to him then I have nobody else to talk to and everything is just getting so bad and I just can't. 
I really just need to talk to him about everything, he is the only person that I feel like I can talk to. But I feel like I'm being selfish and taking advantage of the fact that he is nice and is willing to listen, so that I am just putting all my problems onto his shoulders - too much for him to handle and just dragging him down to my level. I just can't handle this by myself anymore. But I don't want to be one of those people that hurt him while trying to help myself. If that makes any sense. I don't really know what I'm doing and I just don't know how to get help or do anything anymore. I don't want to feel this crap all the time but I don't want to hurt anybody else while I'm trying to fix that. 
I just don't know

Im going to start by saying that im a very private person and coming on here is a big step for me.
I have recently quit my job after many years of bullying and not being listened to, finding work has been incredibly hard. It was a weight lifted off my shoulders quitting work but i still struggle day to day. I struggle to sleep, have disturbing dreams and feel very disconnected. Most of my life i have always been there for others, helping them anyway o can. I recently told one of my friends that i will be focusing on myself and have been completely cut from there life. I feel alone. My mother has been a rock for me, my partner tries to but cares more for his ex wifes needs.  I have always felt that im a burden to everyone, and feel mentally exhausted.

I am a
high-functioning alcoholic and recovering drug addict with recurrent depression
issues who has so far largely refused help from medical professionals.

About five
years ago after nearly 15-years off hard drugs I relapsed and began using
heroin again to cope with the stresses of work, where I was expected to do two
peoples’ jobs while being gas-lighted and undermined by an incompetent boss. Because
I was making good money (six figures) I was able to cultivate a substantial
addiction in a very short period of time, all the while continuing my heavy
drinking which had been a constant throughout my life.

After
repeated attempts to kill off my heroin habit over the next three years, I
finally relented and sought medical advice. I was put on the methadone program
for the next two years.

Three
months ago I quit methadone cold turkey – not an easy thing to do due to its
long half-life. Initially I felt much better after the 10-day sickness passed,
but for the past couple of months I have been crushed by periods of crippling
depression. Sometimes I have been able to manage this by drinking, but just as
often I can’t get out of bed for days at a time and have zero appetite – in the
past three days I’ve eaten just one banana.

I desperately
want to get over this sickness but am struggling to see a clear way through. I
thought killing off the methadone would help, but now I’m just swamped with
dark thoughts that simply won’t leave.

Not even
sure why I’m posting this here, it just feels like something I need to share
with someone, somewhere.

I’ve had depression for about 10 years. It very much comes in cycles for me. 
Sometimes I will be travelling pretty well and then it creeps back in. I often avoid it and don’t do much to help myself until it gets really bad and I end up being self-destructive. I don’t really have much family/friend support but I’ve always seen GPs/Pscyhologists/Psychiatrists. However, I’ve recently moved towns and haven’t yet connected with any health services.
I feel like I just go through cycles of counselling (which costs so much money) and I don’t really pick up any new strategies that actually make a difference/that I genuinely want to use. I stress about how much it costs when I don’t feel like they have given me any helpful strategies (although I do feel better talking to them).
Right now, I’m struggling to get through the day. I work in a job that is very people-oriented and requires me to be pretty aware and on-my-game. At the moment, I’m so anxious about completing daily tasks that I just can’t even start them. When I’m at work, my mind feels fuzzy and I struggle to communicate with people (which is the main part of my job). I just don’t want to be around anyone. 
I kind of want to push through my symptoms of depression and anxiety because in the past I’ve given in and given up completely. I’ve quit many jobs and broken down at many different workplaces from getting to this point. I feel like I’m at breaking point in this job now too. I’m worried if I keep doing what I’m doing, I’ll break down at work and end up quitting in a moment of desperation. If I did leave, I don’t want it to be like that.
Also, it’s extremely difficult to get more than a day or two off work so I cant take any extended time off or anything to just reset (I don’t think time off would help me at all as this intensifies my anxiety).
Do I take one day off? Do I just keep pushing past the symptoms and try to not fall apart at work? Do I quit this job and try and find something less stressful, where I can have more flexibility to manage my mental health? 
Does anyone have any strategies to stop yourself just completely falling apart when you just have to go to work/look after kids/etc? Do you just push through to get things done? 
Im going and getting a referral to a psychologist this afternoon but I need immediate strategies.

Hi everyone,
It's been a few years since my last post. I thought I could keep everything in my life under control. But now, I'm feeling super anxious and depressed. I'm in a well paid job, I'm financially secure (for the first time ever) and now I'm doing night classes for a professional degree and yet I'm still down. I can feel myself unraveling at the seams and I can't stop it. 
I'm starting to avoid work and taking more sick leave and I'm handing my assignments in late for uni. My job is good but my boss at work is bullying me and I feel it's because she can sense I'm depressed but I can't leave my job because I'm supporting a sick parent. My law degree is highly competitive and I'm starting to really doubt myself and now I'm not attending classes. I thought it was my dream degree but I'm guessing I enrolled so I could find a viable way out of my current dysfunctional job. 
I feel like I'm sabotaging myself and feel helpless. I've decided to go back to therapy but I'm not sure if that will help and my meds just make me feel numb. Has anyone just woken up one day and wondered where their life went and how they got here?

Hi, I suffer from BPD and 7 months ago my fiancee had an affair and left myself and our daughter who is 19 months, I wanted to sort things out but he no longer loves me. He chased me for so long, adored me, I was his everything and I felt so safe. Then he just left after 3 years and I simply cannot get through it. I'm drowning in depression, feeling worthless, I feel like everyone including my daughter would be better off if I wasn't here. I have been suffering from back issues and have had several surgeries to correct it so I can't do much and play with my daughter or go out etc, I'm sick of the pain and pain meds, I'm sick of looking terrible, feeling terrible, I am just barely holding on. I've had to take unpaid leave from my job since my back issues so I feel even more useless because I'm not working and finances are tight. I'm so stressed, I cry every night missing the love of my life, I don't know how to cope without him, or how to move forward as we co parent. I'm not strong enough to cut him out of my life and I don't want that for our daughter. My heart is literally broken, if I wasn't so awful, ugly, or if I was prettier and thinner he might have stayed. I put on a brave face for everyone else but I've been in bed for days now just crying and thinking how much I just want and need all of this pain and suffering to end. I know BPD can increase emotions incredibly and I'm not sure how to handle a break up whilst suffering from a mental illness. I have stopped seeing friends as I hate that they are happily married and have wonderful lives, and I'm a single mum with nothing going for her. I just don't think I can survive this. It's been a while and any ""normal"" person would have started to move forward now but I am too broken, defeated and exhausted to keep going. Can anyone give any advice or have been through something similar? Xx

Hello. I would like to introduce myself as a sad 15 year old girl losing hope. I am currently in a relationship with someone who I have no shame in introducing as the love of my life. We have talked for 2 years and dated officially for 9 months. These past two weeks have been very hard for me. I have detached myself from the norm, my sleeping schedule is irregular, I can’t be bothered taking care of myself, I can’t be bothered eating, I have emotion outbursts which hurt a lot of my friends and my amazing boyfriend and I also need attention a lot and validation. I however have a bad habit of unintentionally making people feel at fault for my situation.. I don’t mean to do it, it just happens. (This is where my boyfriend comes in.) I also have a bad habit of overthinking. I believe my boyfriend hates me. I believe he wants to stay with me for my body even when he constantly tells me he doesn’t... and tbh.. I don’t know anymore, because when we’re together he can’t seem to control himself and we end up having sex 2-3 times in a row. He’s been here for almost 3 years so what if all these bad thoughts are true? He constantly validates me and tells me What he loves about me and I trust him.. but I’m very insecure and overthink every little situation. I end up having emotion outbursts and taking things out on him.. because he has a rough past which would make any girl leave. I don’t know what to do. I love him genuinely... but I feel and though I’ve been bothering him so much lately that he hates me..

Hi there
I’m a mother of 4, nearly 45 years old and I’ve suffered from Depression for as long as I can remember. I’m particularly bad right now.
I have no friends and no desire to have any. I have a wonderful husband who is supportive but over it. I have zero libido and he’s sick of it and I’m wracked with guilt because of it. I have a job I enjoy but which is currently causing me substantial stress and anxiety. I have had many jobs over the years. About 2 years is usually my limit, by then I’m miserable and desperately unhappy. I hoped this job would be different... it’s not... I’m not able to maintain our house, it’s a mess. My kids are wonderful and I love them more than life itself but they’re lazy and entitled. I feel looking back that I should never have had kids, not because they’re not wonderful but because I should not have brought anymore versions of myself into the world. I feel ill to my stomach when I see them behave like me. I wouldn’t wish myself upon my worst enemy.
I’m lying in bed feeling nauseous and exhausted. I’ve told my husband I’m so very low and he doesn’t know what to do. I don’t know what I want him to do. I don’t want to leave my room, nevermind leaving the house. My anxiety levels are through the roof and I’m feeling completely helpless and overwhelmed.
im not taking medication. I was on medication and it always stops working. I’ve put on 20 kilos since going on it and it doesn’t help anymore. I’ve tried other medications and they don’t work for me. They make me feel sick or awful and fuzzy in the head. One gave me major heart palpitations.
I’m tired of trying. I got a mental health plan from my Dr but couldn’t bring myself to go, now I’ve lost it. I can’t bring myself to go back and ask again. I don’t know where to turn or what to do. I don’t know how to keep going..,

Hi all,
I just wanted to know if anyone else has suffered with the above symptoms with their depression? 4 weeks ago I had a severe attack which was accompanied by neck and shoulder pain (which had built up over weeks). It was like I had the flu and my brain was shivering like your body does when you have flu symptoms. It wasn't like the 'zaps' you usually get when you've missed an anti depressant but an actual shivering. I ended up in Emergency as the overwhelming and uncontrollable fear combined with the neck pain out weighed me. 
I've been on anti depressants for nearly 20 years & have been stable for around 90% of the time. Now all of a sudden I'm having a set back and have had to increase my dosage to 40mg, it's been 5 weeks and doesn't seem to be helping at all. Do you think it might be time to change medications? Do they sometimes just stop working?
To add to my set backs my world has changed greatly over the last 5 years.  I had my Mum & a friend pass away, a sister I was close to I no longer see (long story). I've turned 50 (struggling with peri menopause & not liking the aging thing much!!)  I moved to a remote town where I don't know anyone (My extreme anxiety and lack of confidence, prevents me from meeting new ppl). I lost my job so have ALL day to think, plus my hubby works away every other week so I'm here alone with the dogs (I have not children either). The rest of my family are scattered to the winds & we aren't close at all. We have never really talked about depression openly, it's like they just don't know how to deal with it so ignore it. I have a few friends but no one super close I can talk to. I don't want to burden them anyway. I'm seeing a psychologist but as it's free the appointments are few and far between.
I know most people suggest getting a job, meeting people but how? How do I get out of this cobweb of fear when getting out of bed is a chore? Sometimes it's crippling and I'm asking myself what's the point? 
I know this is the place to find some help and like minded people. Any advice other than the normal? Are there other ways to meet like minded people offline? (not that there's anything wrong with online :) I thought it'd be easier to talk to people who understand the battle.

Hi, it’s been a year or two since I last posted. I have had depression for 15 years and anxiety for 5 or 6. 
I have lost 3 jobs over my anxiety and depression and today my fourth. 
I go along nicely for a few months and try my hardest to be positive and push myself every day then something just tips me over the edge. This weekend it was my 10 year old being defiant and tantruming. 
I saw a psychologist for 4 years but moved to the country 1 year ago which has limited resources. 
I feel like I want to give up but know I can’t. I have a 17 year old and a 10 year old at home and two adult kids that live elsewhere. 
I was 2 weeks out from finishing my tafe course but now just want to give up on everything. I’m so tired of the fight and my family not understanding.

Hi all, 
I graduated with a degree that I thought would lead me to my dream job, but years in the degree made me realise this isn’t for me. Yet, my degree is so specific that I don’t have a lot of options for a career. After going to a career counsellor, I’ve decided to take on the so called dream job of mine. 
Currently a month in, I feel like I’m a burden more than anything, and I don’t always appreciate my boss’ sense of humour (he gives constructive advice plus some destructive words eg you fail, or something sarcastic in front of others to add humiliation). I have made mistakes, but my boss tends to harp on it while the other employers just point it out and let it go after. I’m also so drained by the end of the day, that I just go home, and eat dinner and sleep. I’m trying to lose weight to make myself feel better but it’s so hard at the end of the day, or even at the start. I’m considering going for regular counselling, just to keep myself sane, otherwise I’m not sure how long I can last.
Thanks for the read and I appreciate any advise!

It makes me angry, it makes me so angry. It makes me feel so small and the world is going to forget me or move on without me. I lost my mum four years ago and I still struggle with it. I can't tell if I was depressed afterwards or even before she passed. She went out one morning for her morning run and at 3am the next day she was found, police knocking at our door. How she passed still traumatises me to this day, it was of no ones intent. But it still sits with me in my mind at often strange times. I remember going to the supermarket that morning with family friends and wondering how I should be screaming. I wanted to scream at these people, I wanted the world to stop because mine had. And there I was buying chocolate croissants when my mum had just died. To this day I struggle to say 'she died' its so harsh and abrupt I usually opted for passed because it sounded so much more peaceful. I was 15 at the time, just starting VCE and felt like a failure because I couldn't focus on studying.
We moved house and with it came the dawning sense of she really never would be coming home. I remember someone knocking on the door at the old house while I slept and in my half-awakedness I thought it was her, I cried long and hard. I remember even three years later police again knocking at the door and it all came back, they were after something or someone else. But my world sank and again I cried long and hard. I still think she will return one day. I still think she's at work and she's late. I remember sitting around the table the night of day we found out us four eating baked beans on toast, but all still hollow in our stomachs.

So here I am now, struggling still. Because I really am. I have spoken to a grief counsellor, someone at headspace, a GP and now someone new. Maybe I'm doing this wrong, but I can't think of a right way to do it. I think when my depression flares it's ruddy head my anxiety flares too. Its new for me this anxiety but it's been gobbling me up whole, I have been crying at work thinking they all hate me and maybe they do. I feel so alone in this and maybe I am. So I guess I want to know what to do, how to do it, where to go, when to do things, whats right, whats wrong and will I ever feel like depression isn't sitting on my shoulders give me a nudge or push when I can take no more.
I know life is worth living and there is beauty in it, I see it in the sun filled fields with morning fog just as I still see her, but I am struggling. I really am.

My partner walked out on me half way through a mental break down and is on her way home which is 9 hours away. I had pleaded with her to stay but she left anyway.
I feel empty but full of emotion, I need some sort of release, just to let the pressure out. She won’t answer my calls and she’s illiterate so I can’t text her how I’m feeling.
I think this is the end of us.
*side note* I am diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and PTSD but think there’s more undiagnosed issues.

I recently was forced to leave a job and company I love because of a new bully manager who’s made my life miserable for the past few months. Now jobless, I’m stressed out with mortgage and bills. Worst of all my partner blames me for being unemployed and kept saying I’m the problem instead. He was unhappy because we can’t afford to go on holidays. I had to re-adjust my spending as well which makes him more upset to the point he didn’t want to go out anymore because ‘we need to save money’ as you have no job. I cried almost every night and I’m at a loss. I’m trying my best to find a job but it’s been a few months. I sometimes looked at my friends social media updates with amazing jobs and supportive partner, which made me even sadder. Whilst I am applying for jobs late into the night my partner is in the bedroom sleeping. I felt so inadequate and desperate. I’m not coping well with the stress and negativity and wonder what I can do? Any advice will be great.

I just recently went through a break up.. I feel like a fool for letting someone sponge off me and my 2 kids..  Controlling me into how he wanted things to be.. dealing pot from my house and even cooking DMT in my kitchen (without my kids being around). He head butted me during an argument.. I had cops remove him and put an intervention order on him.. now I'm left battling a pot habbit all over again.. haven't smoked since he left.. just trying to kick tobacco now. I just feel like an idiot for getting involved so much when my kids should be the most important thing in my life. My kids are 3 years and the other is 20 months. I guess now I know what's most important. I just feel stupid for letting it happen. The sad thing is I feel like everyone is sick of me, I'm in atleast $2000 debt with after pay and my parents... I spend too much on just crap. I've abused Afterpay and can't see myself even buying enough food shopping for the next 3 week's. I have no friends because I abused that during a break down I had 7 years ago. I'm Bipola type 2.. meds are helping the addictive situation.. I just want someone to vent to. I dont want to be in therapy. I cant be bothered.  I dont miss him at all I'm just embarrassed at myself.

Hello! This is my first time posting. I’m a little nervous. Not even sure if I’m posting in the right category, ahah.
I’m 14, diagnosed with GAD at around 10, depression late last year. Started taking medication last year. My anxiety reached a point roughly a year ago where I had to leave mainstream schooling, and now do school online. But my grades are slipping. This school isn’t working, as I have no motivation, no will to work, but I can’t go back to mainstream school. 
I feel like I’m going mad. My emotions are wonky. I’m always pitying myself. Ive been trying so hard and for so long to change, but I can’t. I can’t even get myself to see my psychiatrist again. I’m scared. Everything feels hopeless. But I don’t want to give up yet. My Mum has mental health problems, and so do my friends. I can’t leave them behind, but I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I don’t get out much either, regardless of how hard I try to.
I don’t feel like dying. I’m scared of death. I just don’t want to be.
This is all very vague, and I don’t really know what I’m looking for. Ive been hearing the same advice for so long, and it just doesn’t help anymore. There’s a lot more going on in my head, but thats for another time.
Thank you for your time.

I am convinced that I am locked into a future of unhappiness due to the life choices I've made. The regret I feel is overwhelming.
I finished high school in 2010 with good grades. My first terrible decision was to enrol into a high-pressure undergraduate degree that I knew very little about, without even feeling as though it could be something I'd enjoy. My second terrible decision was to continue to struggle through the degree rather than drop out as soon as I realised it wasn't for me.
 I was already diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders coming out of high school, so I thought perhaps they were the cause for my lack of enjoyment and struggles at university. So I continued, for five years, trying to complete this undergraduate degree, often going part time, failing many subjects along the way. I was consumed with the effort of it.
 In the end, it got to a point where I knew I wasn't going to pass any of the upcoming subjects, so I dropped out altogether. I was now 24 years old, feeling as though I'd just wasted five years on nothing.
 I had gone travelling for perhaps a couple of weeks in all this time, and hadn't worked any job beyond some basic retail.
My next terrible decision was to not explore the world about now that I was not caught up with university. I just worked doing a menial job, saving most of the money and spending it on nothing. This was driving me crazy, and without any better ideas, I made another terrible decision: I enrolled in another undergrad degree, in the same field as before, starting again in first year.
I'm 26 now and more miserable than ever. I can't remember not being miserable. I feel like I've sabotaged any chance of being happy in life, for no reason. I wish I could press a button and go back 10 years, but I can't. I don't know how I can possibly be happy in the future now - if I had the freedom to do anything I don't even know what I'd do.

So I won't go into too much detail about my medical issues ( severe eczema) but the mental effects of it is something I never talk about to anyone. Not to my family or my close friends. People generally avoid someone with problems so I never bring it up, to always keep a somewhat normal vibe. I also hate burdening people so I sort of made it a rule to never show my feelings on this. In fact I may have locked out a portion of my emotions entirely so people don't figure me out.

But this... it's getting too much. I'm tired. If it's not my height (162cm) that apparently is a problem, it's my nationality (south east asian), and if it's not my nationality, it's my skin. I had eczema issues for my whole life until early 20's (25 now) so I completely missed the ""gaining experience"" phase with girls. Back then I decided, ""why date if I'll be rejected for my skin anyway"". ""I've lost before I've even begun"". Life felt like I was born with a curse as doctors repeatedly telling me ""there's no cure"". Nothing against them, but after awhile of hearing that, you start to see yourself as a malfunctioning human. Like I don't have the right to find a partner in life or ever be happy. Ironically, I've become a really logical person after locking out some of my emotions. I'm running on pure logic as a coping mechanism right now. So to me, things like suicide is out of the question because me dying means a burden on my friends and family, so that's automatically out of the question. 

In 2015, my eczema actually consumed me and put me into a vegetable state where I went through 6 months of torture to fix myself. Everyday felt like a thousand knives were stabbing me. Even then I held out because the logic of ""if my body has hit rock bottom, it can only go up from here"". After that saga, physically things are better and I've worked super hard to be part of society but I'm tired.

My entire life has been the ""challenger"" and I've always prevailed somehow. But I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of challenging. I don't have anything left except to walk on my knees. I also gave up on people due to bad experiences so I only trust myself when it comes down to it. This doesn't mean I'm rude to people, it just means I never expect anyone to follow through. But life is getting lonely. And darker. I want to cry but I can't. If that happens I feel like I'm admitting defeat.

Anyways, I'm gonna keep crawling. If I'm going to fall, I can at least fall forward.

Hello, I'm new here. Not sure where to start, so will just start. 
I'm 58, a wife and mother to 6 healthy, beautiful kids. Married for 37 years, still in love to a 'blokey' Aussie guy. 
My husband goes away for work 4 days a week. Our 4 girls are grown and flew the nest years ago. We still have two 17 and 14 year old sons  at home. I left my teaching job 5 years ago, due to Major Depressive Disorder/Anxiety/PTSD/Adrenalin Burnout. I needed peace and a quiet life, plus medication. We relocated to a country area 20 mins from town. I have been fairly content, though we are 3 hours from our girls, so with their busy lives, we don't get to see them often.
I can't really explain why, but I find myself in depression again. I feel so lonely. My boys are typical teenagers and computer gamers, so rarely get any conversation from them. My husband isn't much of a talker either. We are fairly isolated, but I don't have any desire to go out in the world and prefer my pets to most people. The anxiety/depression has me up all night and I then sleep most of the day and have zero energy. My anxiety has me ruminating about everything, especially the future.
The girls have left home, and my career, was my 'empty nest' plan. I always knew I would be very sad when the kids grew up. I thought I would have my job to keep me busy and happy. Without my kids and my job, I don't know who I am anymore. My husband and I have a stressful marriage, as he has these binges over-self medicating and in the past binge drinking. I feel on edge most of the time, because it's like a roller coaster, you know the drop will come eventually. He is currently having counselling himself, which I hope will help him change his behaviours. We love each other dearly, despite the ups and downs and I can't imagine life without him, which is another thing I worry over constantly. He keeps reminding me that we are getting old and is very negative about it, which stresses me out.
So, here I am alone with myself and my thoughts. Logically, I know all the things I should be doing (exercise, get out, hobbies) but I hate exercise and don't want to be with people, have no energy. I have no friends (work was my social world) and no desire to make friends. I can't work due to other health issues. I feel overwhelmed by my sadness and loneliness. My GP of 17 years is 3 hours away and I don't like the GPs here. I wake up each day thinking, 'is this all there is now?' The black dog sits beside me again. 
Soraya :(

Hi, my whole life I've always been dealt with a raw deal here and there and I've always managed to brush it off and move on with my life. Since my early 30's however, it has not been possible to move past any emotional hurdle. I was in a high-stress job which gave me such severe anxiety I ended up in the ER unable to breathe, and since moving on from there I now live in a home with someone I am very attached to but who doesn't see me back in the same light. Each and every day I'm forced to put on a smile and be supportive of him and his dating life while I hurt so much inside to the point of physical pain in my chest and severe depression.

I guess my question here is, whilst I know I need to remove myself from this toxic environment, I can't do so without hurting him and he will never feel the same way about me as I do about him so talking about it won't solve anything. How can I handle this? I don't know how much more I can take of this severe loneliness and feeling of never being enough for anyone.

I've been single for 7 years and find it hard to connect with anyone who doesn't just want to use me and then leave. No matter how hard I try I can't seem to keep people in my life that want to stay...

I’m in the process of preparing to return to work (special ed teacher) after an extended period of maternity leave. I was initially due to return to work 3 days/week when my son was approx 9 months old but IVF, pregnancy (being under-medicated) and life with a newborn really didn’t agree with my major depression and anxiety so I pushed my return date.
Then my mum (main support and the only person keeping me going through this already challenging time) was diagnosed with advanced and aggressive lung cancer with 10+ brain tumours. No one would commit to a prognosis but we were told ‘months not years’.
Thankfully we had some savings so I could further extend my maternity leave (mum was going to be our childcare) but 4 months after diagnosis, my mum passed away. To say I didn’t cope is an understatement but I had my 9 month old son to focus on so with massive help from hubby I was able to go through the motions, keep everyone alive just doing the bare minimum to survive.
And we did this for about a year. Then reality hit and I realised we had just about gone through our savings and I had no choice but to return to work. New meds had me out and about with my son a little more and there were times where I was actually looking forward to going back to work. We’ve got me set up for success as much as I can possibly think of including my son being settled at daycare and he will be attending 4 days per week even though I’m only actually working 3 to give myself that day at home to recharge, recover and prepare for work etc. I was even able to do a casual day on Friday (last day of term) which was just perfect for my anxiety as I only had 3 days to stress about it and I will have time to be prepared for when school goes back. 
But this brings me (finally) to the actual point of my post. 2 days later and I am still completely drained and just want to hide away and hibernate. I expected this to some extent, I’ve effectively been living separate from the big bad world for almost 2.5yrs, spending the majority of my time at home and really only leaving the house with hubby, and I’ve just gone and dropped myself right into the middle of it, a full day, surrounded by predominantly strangers, not a single ‘safe person’ in sight and then I had to put the mum hat on once we got home! 
But 2 days feels excessive and so now of course I’m worrying that it’s always going to be like this so I won’t be able to manage so what then?!?

Hi guys thank you for listening I guess I will share my story.
First of all I feel really guilty to come forward with my depression. I have a roof over my head, pay my bills and have my health these are all things I am greatful for but for some reason I am not taking any happiness out of life. I work in the entertainment/social media industry 7 days a week and while I love what I do I feel pressure because I constantly have to have my game face on and deliver which is really putting my anxiety levels up as well. I don't have many friends but to be honest this is partly my fault I have abandonment issues that come from my childhood that I haven't really dealt with so i either push people away or become to needy and they leave. I can't seem to open up about how I feel I usually battle all this in silence but when I do occasionally talk about what I am going through I feel my friends look at me like I am broken or a complainer.
 
I also have a girlfriend who is very nice but she is another nationality meaning there can be a language barrier and she doesn't understand a lot how I'm feeling and i think my bad days are pushing her away as she is becoming distant. My personality is a contradiction. When I am having good days I always try to be the annoying optimist and look at the glass half full. I suppose even on my bad days I am the same somewhat but sometimes things feel so helpless I just wish I was no longer here. My line of work and minor financial issues are causing me some anxiety but as far as my depression goes I wish I knew where it was coming from as no matter what positive projects I try I just can't seem to find happiness in my life. Thank you so much for listening everyone I am just very lost.

Hello,
i have suffered from mental illness for as long as I can remember. Recently after a mental break I was diagnosed with BPD. Around this time I left my husband and since have suffered intense shame, guilt, constant clipping anxiety. I have a new relationship which brings its own challenges and I emotionally react to every slight thing. I’m tired. I’m so tired. I’m tired of being afraid. I’ve lost a considerable amount of weight from physical illness from the anxiety. I have a Gp I take meds and see a psych but nothing has seemed to bring any relief. I have a ok relationship with my ex because of our 2 boys we need to stay in contact even though I have hurt him severely. My new partner is great for the most part but I’m mentally splitting a lot and on eggshells because I cant handle the pain of upsetting him or him being annoyed with me over anything. I seek validation from others constantly and letting people down sends me into a spiral. I want to feel better but I’m almost convinced this is the way I’m going to live. Surviving every day struggling to breathe trying to calm down constant panic attacks. I’m so tired I don’t want to live like this.

Feel so stuck I almost couldn’t write anything.
i know I’m depressed when the first thoughts that run through my head when I wake are “wish i were dead” over and over even though I don’t wish that. I just wish I wasn’t depressed and stuck and financially stuffed.
i have fibromyalgia and cfs/me and depression.
i cant take antidepressants because I react severely to them and end up in ER being made to feel like I’m making it up.
i cant afford a psychologist and have tried to find one that bulk bills. Good luck there. I managed to get free counselling from anglicare last time but the either kept screwing up my apts or the counselor wasn’t skilled enough. She actually told me she didn’t know how to help me.
i feel stuck. What the f do I do now?

Hi all,
Have just had a super heavy few months.
In November I had a shoulder reconstruction with 6 months recovery time taking me away from the active lifestyle I usually live.
That same week my gf (my second love who I'd been with 2 and a half years ) was working overseas for 2 months and we had been growing apart because I didn't want to commit and move to Sydney to be with her. A lot because she was so obsessed with work she neglected me and also because I wasn't ready at the time and felt like being out of the relationship.
I hadn't heard from her properly for a week then she called me and told me she had cheated on me.
Later that day she rang me, when I ignored her call she messaged saying she had been told her Dad was dying of cancer and only had a few weeks to live.
Obviouslu I was going to support her.
She remained where she was working at the time for another week in which time she continued to be with the other guy.
We caught up a couple of times in between her flying to see her Dad in Hong Kong. Each time she'd tell me she loved me and then something would happen and she'd call it off.
Her Dad passed away and I was still there for her but gave her space for a few weeks and then we proceeded to hang out a few times to the point she was calling saying she missed me etc but then she went silent again, finally told me she was pregnant and that we had to call everything off again.
Followong this she would tell me how much she loved me, then go silent again.
Eventually she said she wanted to really work thing's out.
We hung out for a couple of months and she would be super interested one day, call it off the next, never provide any support back.
She also had an abortion which I was there for and helped her through like every other time I've helped her through her stuff.
I never got to recover from the initial hurt, had to bottle up everything to be there for her but obviously the constant being broken up with got me really down.
A couple of weeks ago I couldn't handle the fact I couldn't even organise something nice for her birthday because I wasn't sure what was happening so called it off but told her I didn't want to.
During this I have had depression and anxiety as a result which is weird because I've always been the strong one for everyone.
Now I'm non stop crying, can't sleep, work (I work for myself so am alone a lot at the moment), have constant sad feeling, have seen a number of bad psychologists, don't know where I want to live. What do I do?

I don’t really know how to start but I know that today is a pretty bad day for me - despite an outward display of successful functioning (got myself out of bed and I’m at uni).
Basically I am so sick of feeling so apathetic towards everyone and life in general. Nothing is exciting, nothing brings me happiness and I NEVER feel passion. All I do is look forward to going to bed at night. I’m sick of people telling me that “exercise” will help release endorphins, but since suffering adrenal fatigue last year exercise only makes me bed-ridden and physically sick/exhausted for days afterwards, and even if I were to do low intensity exercise I never have the motivation to get up and go. I’ve noticed my appetite dropping lately too but still upset over having put on weight last year.
Also, every antidepressant I’ve tried has done nothing and my current one has actually made me worse I think. Currently waiting to begin psychologist appointments and I’m waiting patiently for the psychiatrist to book me in (no idea how long that will take).
Anybody else had experience with feeling this never-ending lack of passion for life? I constantly feel there is no point in life because we all just die anyway. P.s I don’t intend on suiciding.
Thanks in advance for anyone’s input
Jenna

Hi.
I'm in my mid 20s and I feel like I have no energy or motivation to do anything. Everytime I think of doing something I'm always just end up not doing it. Even the things I enjoy doing, like Art and Baking, all I want to do lately is play games and play my cats. I see my friends getting married, having boyfriends, having kids and having a successful and fun jobs and friendships within their jobs,and here I am not doing any of those and I feel sad and kind of isolated. I spend my days with my parents a lot, and I try to make plans with friends but my friends are always busy with work. I want to get a job, but I have no experience, or confidence. I've even tried doing uni courses but I don't see anything that makes me passionate or any courses that I really really want to do. I want a change and I want to be like my friends, but I don't know how if there's nothing out there that I find really exciting or passionate? I'm trying my best to keep busy like focus on decorating my room and talking to my parents about general life. And even if I do find a course I really like, I'm always thinking that I'm not smart enough to do it and my brain can't handle it, because I have a mental disability. I've tried doing art courses which seem to work but lately as I said, I just feel unmotivated and have no inspiration or anything to do it. I am thinking of doing photography and modelling as a hobby for instagram and maybe doing a steps course or something but I'm worried my brain can't handle it, and I'm going to stress out and drop out of it, like other courses I have done.
 
Does anyone else feel like this? How do you cope with it?

Had depression for over 15 years. I also have Aspergers.
Medication has not solved the issue. So decided to have TMS. Have two full treatments, one on left side of brain, one on right side. Neither had any impact.
I have had two psychiatrists recommend ECT for me. Went into a private hospital to have ECT treatment. I had extreme agitation and aggression coming out of the anaesthetic. Apparently I need to be restrained to protect myself and the hospital staff. The hospital I was in could not do this, so they passed me off to another hospital. I went through the full evaluation by the CATT team and then they passed me off to another private hospital without telling them of my extreme agitation after treatment. After telling the new hospital, the passed on treating me as well. I tried all the private facilities over ETC and none will treat me. So I went back to the second hospital. Even though I was only evaluated by the CATT team a couple of weeks ago, I now have to go through the full process again. Then if they accept me for ECT they will not book a date. I have to go to hospital emergency and sit and wait for a bed to become free, apparently this could mean sitting in the waiting room for up to 2 days.
The private hospital system will do ECT as a outpatient, the public system will not. The worst thing for my depression is to be confined to a hospital with nothing to occupy my mind. Being in hospital for 4 weeks is not possible for me to handle.
So 2 psychiatrists recommend ECT for me. I am at the end of my rope. I can't go on like this. But they make it so I can't get the treatment I need.

I'm a 32 year old male, father of four and happily married, but I'm afraid that my borderline personality disorder is back and hurting my family.
I was diagnosed four years ago after suffering from depression alcohol and drug abuse, I was in a bad place and put myself into hospital and from there I got the help and understanding I needed, after about 8-12 months I was able to get off the medication which was for more the depression not the BPD, I then met my wife and have not looked back, up until about 6 months ago I noticed I would snap easily and turn small inconveniences into a MASSIVE deal, I hate that I can get so frustrated so easily and I feel like its taking a toll on my family, I can see this in them and it hurts me more so I hurt myself when no one is around, I have over the years had about 8 different jobs and have made excuses to leave all of them and I'm never confident in what I do, I have pushed family and friends away and as of now only have one friend and the everyone else is family, none of which really know or understand what BPD is, I have recently been doing some mindfulness work and have gone back to my doctor to start a new mental health plan but in between all this I am still struggling with anxiety being unmotivated and having very bad mood swings from being really happy and ready for the day to hating everything and everything I do is wrong or not working, I need help to control these BPD attacks because I don't want my family to suffer because of my BPD

Hi everyone long time reader, first time poster. As my title suggest I am unsure on my issues. I will tell you a little about my self. I am 29 years old, overall I have a good life, I have a good job with potential, good family, small group of friends, and a few close friends. 2 years ago my girlfriend of 4 years left me, it upset me, I have since gotten over it and moved on. It was mainly my doing causing her to leave because of my issues. I have a lot of uncertainty, very stagnant and lack motivation in a lot of things I do. Lately it has been getting worse, I always feel down, lonely and want to run away. I went and worked interstate for 6 months thinking it will help, and I ended up hating it and came back home, now that I am home I miss it and want to go back. I am always looking for something, I feel lost, no confidence and even in my job I have lost drive. I enrolled in a course a while ago and I was confident, once it came to assessment I crumbled under pressure and just froze and failed, even the teacher was surprised with the result. I went for a re test, and same thing once assessment happened, I froze and stuffed up. I feel like I am struggling with learning, understanding and feel like I don't know why I am here for. Don't worry I am not having any self harm thoughts, but I simply just sit in my room during the week after work with no motivation, once the weekend comes I do some fishing which relaxes me or I might go away and escape everything, but once I go back to reality I feel trapped and want to run away but I cant as I have commitments here like a job and mortgage. I look at everyone else and see how they are happy and even people with less than me (not that I'm saying I have a lot or I'm better than anyone) and yet I cant understand how I am not happy with my self. To put it simply, I feel like a big loser and it is effecting my day to day life with my concentration as I simply just don't care anymore. I am very disappointed that I failed my assessment as it would of been good for a career change. I am going for a 3rd test in a few weeks and I am nervous and sick of spending countless money if I am going to fail. It hurts the most when I see people less capable that pass and I know I am good at what I do, just lately lack the drive and confidence. It is the complete opposite of what I used to be. I was confident, up lifting, helped everyone and wasn't scared to give anything a crack. Thanks for reading my big essay :).

Hi everyone,
I'm new to this forum but not our pal Clinny D (clinical depression). I'm here because I can't find the light switch to this dark room anymore and I need for you guys to open the curtains so I can see outside and realise that things will get better. 
Damn, no idea why so many metaphors.
I've had depression since maybe 2014 and it's been an unpleasant journey trying to find the thing that works for me. I've taken various antidepressants under the guidance of my GP with no relief so was referred to a psychologist, who unfortunately I didn't find particularly helpful. I've recognised areas of my life that I want to improve on and took action in getting myself to a better place with these. My life is good but my brain isn't. Lat year I was finally referred to a psychiatrist which I was very excited and relieved about, but next month it's been 1 year since I started seeing him and I'm not better off for it. I know I can't expect fast results with medication as they take a long time to work (or not) but right now I'm feeling very discouraged. Combined with my GP, I think I've tried 3 SSRIs, 2 SNRIs, 1 antidepressant that works with melatonin, 1 mood stabiliser and 1 antipsychotic. Right now I'm on an SNRI, mood stabiliser and antipsychotic and just recently was put onto a thyroid hormone as my blood test showed a slightly underactive thyroid (nothing major). I've been trying to exercise, eat better, socialise etc but nothing seems to be working for me anymore and I'm terrified. 
That's where you guys come in. I would really love to hear your stories, particularly those of you who struggled for a long time in finding the right thing that worked for you. I'd be particularly interested in those of you who have tried various medications before finally find the one that clicked. I need to see that this is all worth it and not to give up, because I'm about ready to chuck my psychiatrist out the window and run away. I don't know what I should be expecting from a ""good"" psychiatrist. Any thoughts on this would be very helpful.
Thank you.

Hi
I've never posted or been involved in a forum before. I'm recently separated and struggling badly. I have had manageable depression for 20 years. I've always come out of the fog but now I just can't seem to find my way. I work long hours as a police detective, have my kids every other week and the limited time I have to myself i just want to sleep. I'm falling behind in work, ignoring family and friends and have lost the drive to pretty much anything. I exercised every day but now can't seem to focus on doing even that. I use all my energy to fake being happy and engaged so the kids don't see it. I seem to be stuck in a world that has collided my biological depression with situational depression. My rational brain tells me I will come through this but right now I seem to be just drowning..

I moved out of my boyfriend's house a couple of months ago, because I felt stifled the entire time I lived there. He would pressure me to go his his family's house every single weekend and I knew his family did not really like me all that much. I have been in university trying to catch up on life, as I spent the first 5 years after school unable to attend university due to poverty and mental health problems.
I always felt kinda judged for not having already gotten through uni. And on top of that, my boyfriend had been physically abusive toward me, as well as neglectful and emotionally pretty abusive as well. Despite all that, I had a comfy life and a pet cat, and he would still comfort and cuddle me.
Now that I've moved out, I'm starting to really regret my decision. I went to visit him once, and he called the police on me without warning and for no reason other than to tell them to tell me to go away. So I know he has no respect for me, but I still have these horrible feelings that I have thrown away a perfectly good situation.
I feel incredibly alone, and am finding it really hard to continue studying at uni without him in my life. I kind of feel like everything I am doing is for nothing, and that I have nobody, and that even if I do finish my degree, that nobody will hire me because I am a failure, etc.
I am considering taking a break from uni and going to tafe to study cert in fitness, as I genuinely enjoy all that stuff... And that would mean I can end up in a job sooner. I'm just scared. I'm really scared. What if that doesn't work out? Then what do I do?
I barely have any relevant work experience, so if I finish studies I'm terrified I won't be able to make rent. 
I'm so scared. I have no safety net. Except for like, one friend, who is very supportive of me but obviously its not the same as having family who will help.

I need some kind of reassurance that things will work out okay. Right now I'm freaking out and I feel like I'm screwing up my life so bad. I honestly am beginning to really loath uni so much. I like the area I study in, but the system itself (having to study electives) makes study very difficult to keep up with, and means me having to draw out the length of my degree just to complete the electives. Is tafe better than uni?
Someone please help.

Hey everyone, 
Im 24 and still struggle to know where I fit in, in life. I have always felt this way and always struggled to find a career or direction that I feel content in. I will have intense ideas to make dramatic change in my life and convince myself it will make me happier, I always try and hold back on making big changes as I know it’s impulse. I have always felt odd or like people don’t approve of me, and carry this into every situation. 
It’s always been challenging to make friends and when I do they almost always struggle mentally themselves (relationships also). They are all intelligent/ switched on individuals but usually are quite self loathing and erratic with their friendships, I find myself constantly trying to please them and seek validation even if they are a bad friend. I romanticise validation and find myself day dreaming about situations where I feel validation or admiration (usually socially).
 I consistently over analyse conversations after they have happened and scour through what I should have said, my inner voice telling me that I’m an idiot which usually sends me into a spiral of anxiety. I can never switch off my mind, it’s a loud and overwhelming place to be. 
I generally am quite irritable, especially with my family members and find it hard to accept help, love or empathy from them and others. I am really sensitive to rejection and find it leads me to be relatively depressed, this could be as little as a guy not getting back to me or even a small amount of constructive feedback at work. I generally internalise it and can cope quite well but I get to the point where I feel like I’ll burst. 
I have never self harmed or attempted suicide. I have thought about no longer being here and how it would be easier but knew I would never action those feelings.
 I’m really struggling to feel safe and secure within my daily life.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I had been given my casual contract to sign 2 weeks ago and was told i will be called for induction by the manager. I called after 1 week and she said my contract has been given to HR for processing and they havent gotten back to her. I waited for another week and i had gut feeling something was wrong so  i called this week which 3 rd week going. I have a friend who works there and she told me she asked HR and they havenot received my contract from her. i was shocked since i am very desperate for a job. i called the manager and said if il get an induction simetime soon and she said hurryingly said that my contract is still in HR and i said that i contacted them and they said its not there. she quickly changed and said the contract is with her and she has to fill missing papers. I was calm and said ok thanks. when hung i up the phone i cried that i am being treated like this. My friend advised me to talk to higher post manager and i did call and ask that if my contract has been sent to HR, he said he will have a look and call. He didnot call me back since than. I was depressed whole day and today. i havent eatten much for 2 days. My husband got worried too since i have been looking for job more than 3 years. Why is she treating me like this? i havent even started the job and she is treating me like trash. 
What can i do? I feel like dieing because i finally saw that il get my self worth by working.
I dont deserve this at all.

After approx 12 years on Antideppresants, last 2 years @ 300mg daily, a new psych in Adelaide, which took 11 weeks to see as a new patient, 7 week gap then took place due to his scheduled holidays. As a result though I completed the taper & am off antideppresants but not yet on any alternative. The script he gave me was refused filling by two local chemists. I called my Melbourne Doc & he agreed to not touch it as it was more addictive than antideppresants & could not see how a psychiatrist after 2 sessions could diagnose me. The psych hasn't for clarity. The withdrawals have made me beyond irritable & following quitting my job to take care of my elderly father a year ago, I'm at breaking point in terms of frustrations & anger, I am in no danger to myself & pose none to others. However I haven't slept for more than 11 days have no access to sleeping medication (which went from instant sleep to needing at least 3 tabs to get to sleep for perhaps 2 hours). Valerian etc is all a waste & I eat sleeping medication like tic tacs (kidding, but nowhere near strong enough) My GP in Adelaide said there were very few good psychiatrists in Adelaide & doing a search on this site and the RANZCOP with a 50km radius came up with NONE!
Do I present to a hospital? I have hospital cover & full extras, but I am concerned that I do not want to endure a cinematic experience & end up there for life in a wheelchair staring out a window. I can function but I need something to curtail these withdrawals. I've often wondered if my depression is just symptomatic of something else (I have mountains of books I buy each week but never read, no motivation etc) but it's unreasonable for a new psych to be able to diagnose this after 2 sessions & sadly due to more holidays (his) I can't see him again til May. This is the antideppresant withdrawals I know (I hope). Is Adelaide really that hard to get a good doctor? I've been trying since September & have clearly drawn a dud after waiting 11 weeks for my 1st appointment. Any advice, suggestions would be appreciated. Should I present to a hospital (Flinders or?) I just don't want to create a future problem with my private health cover, employment opportunities etc by taking this step. Will this just pass on its own in a few weeks? For those of you that beat antideppresants eventually, did your sweating stop? That was one of the worst things about it, but now I'm very irritable, sad, exhausted and can't remember the last time I felt really alive.

Hi,
You may guess from the title that I am currently on sick leave. Last Friday, I injured my back hoping out of a car (of all things). It spasmed intensely which resulted in my partner and parents having to pick me up off the driveway and myself having to take over a week off work. In normal circumstances, I wouldn't worry about taking the time off, but over the last 6 months I have had the worst luck. 6 months ago I came off my anti depressants which resulted in me needing a week off. A month later, I injured my foot and needed a week off. One month ago I had a case of gastro which resulted in once again, a week off. And now my back problem! I am sitting here feeling miserable as I am missing out on potential overtime I could be earning as well as missing out on some holiday, since I had to take some days out of my annual leave to cover the days off as I have ran out of sick leave. I fear what my colleagues think (i.e 'oh look he's off sick again') and am worried that my recent absences from work will be detrimental to me ever applying for a promotion. I am only 24 so not really of the age where frequent injuries would be expected or at least not thought of as strange. I also worry that even when I go back to work how long will it be until my next illness/injury? I am not someone to 'chuck a sickie'. I want to work hard and earn money as I am saving up for a house. I know it's out of my control but that just leaves me feeling powerless. I am struggling to enjoy myself here as all I can think of is work.

I moved at the start of the year after being homeless for a little bit. I had no other choice but to move into the place where I am now. It was all good for the first couple of weeks but then it turned. I have depression and anxiety, I had been doing well until it became clear that I'm stuck in a toxic environment. My housemate is an alcoholic and has a few other issues which she puts on me, she also can't take medication as it has the same effect as alcohol. There's now been numerous times where shes been intoxicated and yelled at me accusing me of things that aren't true. When I try to defend myself I get told to shut up over and over again. I can feel myself slowly disappearing, it's like I'm sinking into a hole and I can't get out. I am losing myself, I feel like I'm drowning. I'm trying to find work so I can leave but I'm not having any luck and I honestly don't know how much longer I can last here. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm losing.

Hi there,
I’m not quite sure where and how to start here. I’m a typical male who never ever thought mental health would ever effect me. But the last two or so weeks my mind seems to have other plans. 
I’m a 26 year old English bloke who moved here about 18 months ago. I always thought “what do I ever need to be depressed about?” I have a loving girlfriend, strong family and friend group, home etc. But I’ve been feeling rather worthless here recently and I can’t quite pinpoint how or why. Maybe I’m feeling lonely, homesick, I can’t figure it out. 
I’m usually a fit bloke who enjoys going to the gym 4/5 times a week as well as playing football once a week but in the last few weeks I’ve found myself getting home from work being totally deflated from what little and unproductive work I’ve done for the day. I’ve found my appetite suddenly plummet to where I often won’t eat an evening meal as I’m simply not hungry. And I simply don’t have the energy that I used to. My head is telling me “just get up out of bed, go on a drive, get back to the gym, go explore Australia” but I simply don’t have that “get up and go” mentality which brought me to Australia 18 months ago.
As a job, and no disrespect to anyone out there who may also do the same job, I’m a general labourer on various construction sites. It’s pretty skull numbing (in my opinion). This was always a short term job for me as visa restrictions have made it pretty hard for me to nail down any solid work. I do have a goal in my life to better my career options. And I’m working towards them within the next 6 or so months. But my mind can’t seem to see any further than the next few days. 
I sometimes feel anxious when thinking about my future goals as they could be a risk which won’t pay off for me. I had a semi breakdown for maybe 45 mins before writing this. And I find it very hard to tell my loved ones how I’m feeling. 
I’m aware that there are people in far worse positions than I am right now. But I feel like this was the only way I have to get things off my chest. 
If anyone at all has been through something similar I’d greatly appreciate some advice and hopefully I’ll be back to being the old me in no time. 
Thanks in advance

Am so emotionally drained I can't even type out the whole story, so here's the short version.
Sister called me (yelling) the most selfish person on the planet because my current bout of depression, combined with worst anxiety ever and chronic pain, have me somewhat (a lot) financially reliant on our mother.
Yes, I'm nearly 50, single mother of 3, but after battling depression and anxiety for 20 years and chronic pain for the better part of 6 years, I'm not doing so well.  I know I've screwed up, I know I'm not paying my way.  I have helped my mum as much as I can in non financial ways - she's over 80 now, and pretty healthy, but I'm here for her when she's not - shopping for her, cooking for her, doing anything I can.
Sister just doesn't get the mental health thing - it's all laziness and selfishness in her eyes.
The screaming row happened a few nights ago on one of her rare trips to our part of the world.  I'm beyond hurt.  I'm nearly utterly broken.  I sent her some articles to read about depression and how it feels, I don't think she even read them.
My mother is devastated that we've had such a falling out.
I'm honestly not sure how to get past this.  I can't get what she said out of my mind.  I've replayed it over and over and over and freaking over in my head.  She was SO cruel in her words.  I don't know what to do.  I want to make it right, especially for my mum, but I can't forgive her words.

So I've been depressed for the better part of 5 years now, but never as depressed as I've been feeling the past couple of weeks.

A couple of weeks ago, I had my first run-in with health anxiety, I convinced myself that I had cancer and pretty much cried myself to sleep that night because I was fully convinced that I was going to die. Long story short, after getting tests done, I found out I didn't have it, but the trauma from that incident has stuck with me ever since.

I haven't been the same since that incident. I haven't been able to enjoy myself doing anything pretty much. Things I enjoyed doing not even the day before this incident I just totally lost interest in. For the past couple of weeks, all I've done every day is watch Netflix, movies, YouTube, or anything else just to keep my mind off of things. 

I've also hardly been eating, and have lost 2 and a half kgs in 2 weeks because of this. I'm not taking care of myself whatsoever, just doing anything possible to numb the things I'm feeling. 

The main thing that is getting me down is that I've convinced myself that at some point in my life, it might not be for another 50 years or it could be tomorrow, that I'm going to get some disease and die. Just thinking about my future and the hard things I'll have to go through gets me super depressed. Death is the main issue I'm struggling to come to terms with, I have the mindset of ""if we're all going to die, why even bother doing anything?"" and I just lay in bed all day watching stuff. I find that even the mention of death or some health issue triggers my negative thoughts and it gets me so sad.

I've been sleeping 12 hours a day, and being awake 12 hours a day. It's like a 50-50 ration of sleep to being awake. I know this is super unhealthy both physically and mentally, but no matter what I do I can't seem to get myself out of bed in the morning when my alarm goes off, I just hit snooze and go back to sleep, and before I know it it's 3pm and most of the day has already gone by, making me even more depressed. 

Some days I feel like I'm feeling okay just to get hit with a wall of depression and I go back into the dark place I was in the day before. It feels like a never-ending cycle of ups and downs, but I'm only really focusing on the downs and ignoring the ups.


I want to see a psychiatrist more than anything, but it would take somewhere around 2 months just to get my first appointment. At this point, I'm just hoping for a miracle.

Hey yall, I try to keep this short and simple without any grammar mistakes.
I recently met new friends who are really cool and nice, I like them but I wish they stop changing I dont know why I am like this, I am not at all rude to them in anyway or try to sabootage, I feel depress talking about these topics like getting a job or studying or about the future, I much rather live in the present then have to worry about stuff like that I am only 17 is there any strategies to over come this as I am proud for their achievements,

So i dont really know what else to say. I am so sick of hating myself that much that i get no enjoyment or excitment to do anything. I have tried so hard since having kids to be good at somethinf to have a hobby for both myself and to i dont know i guess make me more mum material but theres nothing. I know it sounds dramatic but i dont have any fine motor skills. I cant baje or cake decorate although ive done classes i dont paint or draw i cant sing or anything i jist feel like i have nothing and its really wearing me down. I need an outlet a boost of confidence and all i get is attempts and fails and friends and family cant even tell me positive about myself. Im juat useless and feel so shit atm. I have alot going on but the fact i cant zone out to a hobby is making it hard to deal with life. 
I cant even read a book cause my mind is so scattered i cognitively cant keep up

Gday gday 
Im a second year at uni and been flipping in and out of depression and anxiety for a few years, and not sure why but suddenly I’m plagued with the feeling of not understanding what’s wrong with me, this incessant need to feel deflated and useless- what’s the point. 
On above avg dose of AD but I’m not sure if they’re not working, or I’m just that sad. I feel like I do nothing but despise my soggy minds obsession of asking me why and if I’m still depressed. This unrelenting sinking feeling of uselessness and not caring about anything is so so damn draining.
For me, anxiety is like having the hiccups, violent and fills the capacity of my mind, but then it stops and I’m constantly on the cusp of waiting for the next one- that throat choking can’t breathe need to swallow type thing.

So...to start with lets look at my childhood or lack there of. I grew up in what would seem to be a pretty happy home, two parents and 3 other siblings. My father however was an asshole to put it bluntly! After the age of 8 he basically hated me or just straight up didn't care. I was a victim of family violence between the ages of 8 and 12. After that it all became verbal, emotional, and mental. Since last year my parents have been seperated and after an episode during visitation with my dad I no longer see him. I am still a victim of family violence though but now it's from my brother.  Now on to the depression. I have been depressed side around the age of 12. It flares every now and then. Today it was pretty bad cause I just randomly started crying and talking to myself like I used to. I am 16 and a girl.

I used to love school. I had amazing teachers and friends and I got good grades. Then I moved across the world and everything changed. My class is small and most of the people in my class are kind of rude. And everyday when I go to school I feel so upset and the teachers there are awful and clearly do not know how to teach and I think I’ll have them as my teachers for one and half more years. I can’t do this anymore. My grades got worse and my few friends I have aren’t always supportive and I can’t transfer schools because the other schools near me are awful too. So I have no clue as to what to do. I’m so stressed and I get panic attacks a lot in school. I want things to go back to the way they used to be. I’m so stressed and confused and I have a test coming up too and we have so much to study for and it’s awful. I don’t know what to do :(

Hi, need some advise on sabotaging special family moments or ocassions. Why does a person purposely begin conflict in the lead up to birthdays, Christmas/Easter holidays, any long weekends, or planned events. It's a pattern that I've noticed, been happening for years, first I thought it was bad timing or coincidence but now I'm so in tune to this behaviour happening, and i dont know why. It's as if these moments or ocassions are a symbol of happiness and the person in question doesn't want to feel that.  Any insight would be so much appreciated. Thanks

Hi friends,
i just wanted to jump on board and voice how I’m feeling, hoping this will help me, maybe see if someone can relate.
im a 36 year old mum of two, a 3year old and a 9 month old. I have suffered bouts of anxiety and depression in the past, also PND after the birth of my first child. Along my journey I have learned to study myself and look out for early symptoms, avoid triggers and look after myself. I take AD and also have been diagnosed with Hashimoto disease which has been super difficult to manage as it is very unpredictable.
after the birth of my second child I was expecting a bit of a rough time- but surprisingly seemed to bounce back quite well- ( despite the mastitis Lack of sleep ect...) so I guess I thought I’d dodged a bullet- that was until a week and a half ago. I suddenly hit a wall, feeling anxious, loss of appetite, upset stomach, tired and wired, lethargic,depression, and crazy brain fog ....
i has a blood test and my TSH was in range but my thyroid antibodies had skyrocketed and so had white blood cells???...
my GP Didn’t really have to much to say ....
i don’t know if this related or return of PND? I know we are not doctors but I guess I’m just seeing if anyone else has had a similar experience?
any advice would be appreciated 
thanks all, and hang in there!

I’m living in a current state of Groundhog Day. I feel like all I am doing is waking up to go to work to pay the bills. 
The problems that go with that, is that I am always exhausted and my partner thinks I have no time for her. 
I hate making her feel bad and down but I don’t know how to make myself feel happy, so how am I meant to show her it’s not her fault. 
To be fair, she’s the only thing that makes me finally get up. 
We are currently fighting over all of this and I don’t know how to help explain to her that I need to work myself out to help us work us out. 
help me out if you can peeps. I’m so drained.

I never thought that my diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder was a life-sentence, I was diagnosed 3 years ago, studying a difficult course, and every year, I feel myself get better, only to slip into it during the final stretches of exam time or in the longer nights of winter. However, April is too early for my symptoms to already start manifesting itself. This feels out of control and unexplainable, and it scares me that I am debilitated with a disorder that I neither understand or have the energy to confront. So help me what do I do? I feel so out of reach, but I don't want to spend my year with this over me.

Hi All, 
I am a parent of a 6 month old and 6 year old. Since Child birth my partner says she is depressed but is not ready to seek medical help. this has now esclated in the last few days holding me responsible for her depression.  There is constant screaming at me (I have not responded or reacted to it), I am at my  wits end what to do and who to turn to. 
She has recently started drinking again, and it says it helps her sleep. I am not sure if alcohol and depression are interlinked. I refused to get drinks once and I have had it handed it back to me for 3 days. Everything I do is incorrect. I have now started doubting myself and am desperately looking for resources to help me cope and educate my kids around this as well. 
Even with our first child for the first 6-8 months she said she was depressed but this time its really viscious. 
Looking for any suggestion / help / support.

Hello,
So, my life has gone down the drain. When I tell myself I'm managing okay, well everything goes pear-shaped. My partner and myself are having to move out of the unit we're living in as both of us lost our jobs last year and we haven't been able to find anything else since. They have somewhere to go, but I don't. I can't go live as their parents as the parents don't like me. They think I'm only interested in my partner for money. I fell for my partner when he didn't have a job.
Having been in a similar situation in the past I do have someone I can contact regarding emergency accommodation, and I have an appointment booked with them on Monday. I've tried asking my friends, and the response has been ""no."" There's also the matter of Centerlink enforcing a new rule regarding partners, as a result the only way I can get anything is to say I don't have a partner. Even if we're not living together I can't get anything because my partner should be able to support me. As I've been told by my case manager at the emergency accommodation office.
Probably left a lot out, but to sum it up: I'm going to be homeless (even if I get into emergency accommodation, which will make me ""legally homeless"") in a matter of weeks, and I may not be able to get any assistance just because I have a partner. I can't get work, and I don't have any formal qualifications.
Since I've been in a similar situation before I'm wondering, does life ever get better? Or should I just stop trying?
I think that sums it up. Not sure though. Hard to think clearly... Or at all really.

I am a new graduate and have just started full-time work at the beginning of this year. I am currently working 6 days a week due to work requirements and it has been draining me out. I feel so tired every day to the point I would fall asleep as soon as I get home and I've realised that work has changed my life, I don't go out anymore to see friends and I dont do the usual things which make me happy anymore. Instead I try to make the most out of social media to show the people I love that I still care even though I am just out of energy. I mean, I love what I do but suddenly Im feeling very isolated. I know everyone is busy with their own lives but over time I just feel that no one puts any effort in caring for me and checking up on whether I am alright anymore. Im just alone, I dont feel needed in people's lives even though I've put in the effort regardless of being so tired.  The feeling of isolation is starting to eat me up, I open my messenger chat and tears just keep coming down because people I message, people that I put 101% effort to show their importance dont feel the same for me. I know its stupid and I know it might be just me being emotional but I just dont know what to do anymore. I feel like cutting everyone out and being alone for sometime... I just wish someone would reach out and be there for me, understanding what Im going through and telling me things will be fine.  I dont feel like I have depression but lately Ive just been staying in bed on the days I dont have work and sometimes I cry for no reason... I dont know what this is..... Can someone help me out?

A reoccurring problem that I've lately had more trouble with than ever is that I feel like everything is so overwhelming that I can't seem to understand reality. I'm so confused about everything and I can't seem to understand the realness of life. How is time real? I can't seem to understand or piece together that anything is real. I feel so alone and sad. Please help me, please give some advice as I feel stuck in a fake reality when I know I've felt better before so this feeling can't be right.

Hi,
I had surgury on my cervical spine 4 weeks ago for chronic pain and this appears to have gone well. I do suffer with anxiety/depression and find that I am struggling with such a ""heavy head"", even worse compared to when I had a particular difficult day prior to surgery.
I saw my GP this morning and I said it may be the after effects of the surgery and she mentioned it may be post operative depression. At the time I didn't ask more about it. Now I am wondering if anyone has had experience with this. I am finding it particularly difficult, I am extremely fatigued, I am having extreme difficlty getting myself out of bed each morning. I have a rest and when I get up, I still feel fo tired, I seem to be getting round in a daze etc. I am going for a walk each day; but I am dragging myself arond. 
Can people who have diagnosed depression be affected more by anathetic's? How long will this hang around, in the back of my head I don't want to feel like this but I can't seem to shift it, I am pushing myself to work with it, but it is really horrid. Thank you.

Hello to all,

I posted on this forum a few years ago during what was a rough time (that ended up getting rougher - and i never came back here because i didn't see the point) where i ended up losing my boyfriend after he cheated, my grandmother passing suddenly, mother leaving my dad (also cheating) and my grandfather being hospitalised shortly thereafter.

I sort of posted here as a last ditch effort to just... well i don't even know.. i guess just to have it down somewhere that i was struggling when honestly noone really gave two expletives.

That all started november 2016. My life prior to that was nothing fancy, and ultimately i have been a failure most of my adult life. The last full time job i held was when i was ~20 and it wasn't full time, it was flexible around my university times which worked. But i was let go because the company was not receiving its accounts receivable fast enough to keep up with its bills. Being casual, first to be chopped.

Since then i ended up dropping from uni as among other things i couldn't afford to go there anymore, i ended up coming out to my immediate family in 2012 as a ""well ill tell them, worst case scenario i end up on the streets/alone anyway"". Ive had 2 relationships, both partners cheated on me and left me for their other person/people. 

I'm struggling with everything at the moment. When i can find motivation to sit down and attempt to apply for jobs, i look at my resume and just dismiss it entirely. I have no skills on paper that these jobs want, but also no way of getting them because noone will give me the chance. On top of that, due to having 0 finances of my own and such, i do not have a social life. I do not go out because i simply can't afford it, so i have no friends either that i could meet up with and even talk to.

My life has moved on in exactly 0% capacity since my ex left me and that was 2016... we're almost 1/4 through 2019 and.. i just don't know what to do anymore. I'll be 28 this year and i have nothing to show anyone, nothing to be proud of, nothing that stands out and nothing to offer anybody to even tip the scales in my favour to keep them in my life in any capacity. What do people do in these situations? My life is so far off track from where it needs to be.

Hi, 
I've been with my partner for 9 months when we first got together i was coming off medication for diagnosed major depressive disorder as the self help and cbt that i was doing was working well. The last couple of months i have started to struggle again and i recognise  the symptoms of my illness are beginning to return i feel that im going to be right back where i started if i dont start taking the meds cobined with the self help/cbt again however my partner says theres nothing wrong with me and that i should just deal with it and i dont need medication and if i do decide to take it she will leave. To complicate things further my parner has diagnosed ASD so im not sure whether or not she can recognise the symptoms and if i try to explain it to her she is very dismissive once again saying theres nothing wrong with me. I can feel myself starting to withdraw and explaining my feelings is becoming more and more difficult for me. I dont know what to do its an impossible choice for me.

Hi everyone,
I just need answers. I have everything in life. A loving partner. Loving friends. Loving parents. I have a secure job and everything most don’t. But I don’t feel right. I wake up feeling down with no explanation. I feel sad and don’t know why. I hate to be alone. I don’t know why this is happening and I want help :(

Hi everyone. 
This is my first time using this service but I felt it was time to finally reach out so I can put my mind at ease. I am nearly 22 and living with Bipolar 1. It has been a recent diagnosis in the last few months and looking back at the last 10 years it really makes a lot sense and sums a lot of past emotion and action up. 
I’m writing because today has been a particularly bad one. I am currently experiencing what I always experience after a bigger scale breakdown. The physical side effects. My brain and hands become tingly, I feel extremely numb or ‘hollow’, lethargic and pretty down. I am also going through some kind of congestion and will probably experience cold or flu like symptoms over the next week. This happens every time after a day like today. 
Does anybody else experience this after a dip in their mental well-being? And how do you manage the physical side effects in a healthy way? 
I’d love to hear about any experiences or about any coping strategies you may have that I might find useful. I am a very fidgety and ‘million mile an hour’ brain kind of person and I like to practice mindfulness in times like these so anything to help pull my mind and body back into sync would be helpful! 
 
Sorry for the letter of a post, 
B.

I'm worried I may be suffering with some depression and it scares me. This post may not make sense as I think I need to just ramble in order to get everything out.
Basically where I am right now in life is right at the end of 24 months back to back of fertility treatments trying to conceive another baby (first was also conceived after 18 months with fertility help). I have a lot of guilt overflowing from me regarding our issues because my husband's fertility is perfect (been tested multiple times).
We had just had our 24th consecutive cycle fail and were signing paper work to start a new plan of attack when my FS (fertility specialist) ordered a complete blood work up because I suffer with a condition called PCOS (polycycstic ovarian syndrome) and unfortunately for me I have it very severe. Basically in the space of a few hours we went from talking about how I'd more than likely be pregnant again by the end of the year to receiving what felt like a death sentence. Basically my condition has gotten completely out of control even with medication and diet and I'm right on the edge of developing a lot of life threatening conditions...and i'm only 28. So we have been forced to stop trying for another baby and I need to have a scary operation done that I never wanted to do but am being essentially forced into. Or I probably wont make it past 50. So I'm trying to process that and essentially grieve the loss of something I have fought for and wanted so badly which naturally comes with grief and guilt by the truckloads. Then less than 24 hours after all of that unfolded my 2.5 year old son was diagnosed with ASD (autism spectrum disorder). In the last few weeks following that it feels like my son's behaviours have amplified by a lot and I am overwhelmed with this hopelessness. I don't think I'm good enough for my son. i don't think i am good enough to be the mother of an autistic child. I feel like I'm going to fail him. Which has been so heart breaking because I love him more than I love anyone, even myself. I'm also pretty sure its my fault he has autism...
But in the last 2 weeks I have found myself crying all the time. Im tired but I can't sleep. Im snappy and angry. So angry at the world for everything thats happened. We are good people. So many awful people get pregnant at the drop of a hat and healthy kids to then just abuse and neglect and here we are. And here I am. Falling apart and hiding so no one knows i can't handle everything thats happened.

Hi all, 

So me and my boyfriend have been together for a few years now and he suffered from a medical condition when he was younger, that has lead to him developing depression at a young age. He has handled it over the years very well and only comes up every now and again. Only last year was he operated on and finally the medical issue has been fixed. But recently he has gone quiet and come to me and his family and has told us that his depression is back. He is now distancing himself from everyone even me and the only person he talks to about this is his mum. I have approached him about it and he said he doesn't want to bring me down with him so therefore he doesn't like discussing his depression with me. I am obviously not going anywhere and he knows that but I am just struggling with how I am meant to help him. I have never been in this situation before and it's all a bit overwhelming and trying to consider both him and myself is taking it's toll on me. I am trying to he there and support him but I feel useless, because I don't know how to help him when he is down like this. 

I would love some advice or tips on how to approach someone with depression and how I could possibly help my boyfriend so he isn't alone while recovering from this.

Hi all, 31 female GAD, SAD and depression sufferer here. Currently medicated and in therapy. Just need to tell someone how I'm feeling right now.

I have a best friend who is wonderful. She understands my anxiety and she's my trusted confidant. She's also gorgeous and tiny (men love her). I'm a size 18 introvert who have always had problems with my body image. I've never felt beautiful or attractive (and I certainly don't inspire attention in the opposite sex).

Today was my best friend's birthday party. A group of her friends (most that I've met previously) and there was swimming and eating and drinking. 

With my SAD and introverted tendencies being around a big group of people was always going to be challenging. What I didn't expect is how crap I'd feel about my body. Everyone at the party was skinnier and prettier than I was. There was this very attractive guy that I wanted to flirt with but knew he would never be interested in a woman like me. I didn't swim because I'm not confident wearing a bathing suit. 

Now I've come home after the party and I just feel like crap. I either want to binge eat or go on a starvation diet to try and resolve this anxiety and negative thoughts. 

Now I know that I can't immediately react and that I need to step back and thinking things through from a more positive perspective. But for right now I feel ugly, fat and unattractive and I think the world thinks of me that way too.

GREETINGS!  I'm a wife and a mum of two daughters (14&11), each with their own disorders, married to my husband for 22 years. I'm posting to raise awareness of a shadow I've journeyed with in my husband, in the hope that if you relate to my story, can gain understanding and be encouraged along the path that you tread. Some of you may have seen the shadow too, but it seems it is not yet widely known.
As I look back to pre-marriage times, these TRAITS have been consistent in my husband: very highly strung emotionally, sleep problems, consistently presenting fast mood swings over irrational reasons, always pessimistic,
negative, fearful, insecure and plagued with socially based issues.  A personality that is perpetually
inconsistent, hard to understand and every 2-3 years, a complete emotional shut out would occur for 5 days (no more than 7). I've always known with my husbands adolescent environment there'd be a crash of some kind and that there was something not quite right, but as it is so common, I only became aware when a major depression episode MDD occurred. Within him there's been 5 yrs of MDD and a personality&faith change (they're the big ones) and with me pain, loneliness, being unloved, research and repetitive explanations have been said. After a 6yr total, he's back to pre-MDD in way, but I am still faced with ""I'm normal, there's nothing wrong, I don't need help, I don't need to change!"" and a conscious ignorance, avoidance and resistance towards issues that are obvious. I was constantly perplexed as to why, until during my research I came across what I've dubbed as the Black Dog's shadow!
DYSTHYMIA (pronounced dis-THIE-me-uh), is a chronic (long lasting), milder form of depression which now falls under the umbrella of Persistent Depressive Disorder (DSM-5). I found that Medical research state, that due to the chronic and subtle nature of PDD symptoms, sufferers believe that the
depression is part of their character. PDD with MDD is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept the heightened major symptoms as an extension
to who they are, which is beyond their control. When the episode has ended,
however, they would return to their previous state of chronic, low-level depression.
This is why myself, family, friends, co-workers/employers and
circumstances external to my husband, are perceived by him as the CAUSE (not trigger)
of his negative feelings. For him, there is no reason to
change or seek help and yes, I'm still waiting for the penny to drop.

Hi, ive resorted to a forum because i dont really have anyone else to talk to about this. 
I have been with my partner on and off for 2 years now, everytime its off its his decision. Its like a routine every couple of months. It usually begins with him not replying to my messages for weeks at a time, when i ask him if he wants to end things i usually only get an 'i dont know what i want' 'relationships make me stressed', 'seeing anyone all the time makes me stressed', he never actually ends it unless i kind of demand an answer which makes me think he knows he is likely going to want to be with me when he is not 'stressed' anymore, so he is just trying to wait out the stressed period until he feels up for a relationship again. 
I'm just not exactly sure how to deal with it, i have my own anxiety issues which causes me to panic myself when this happens. He doesnt take medication (he thinks it makes him feel worse or feel nothing at all) and he doesnt get any profession help. He immerses himself in his work because if he isnt working he says it gives him too much time to think which he doesnt like. 
He is the most amazing partner and when he is feeling well he always wants to talk and see me and when he isnt feeling well he is never mean about it, he is just very vacant and only says things like 'i dont know whats wrong, i cant explain it, im sorry'. And then when he is well again he is so positive and sure about us. One day he will be telling me how happy he is to have me and then suddenly i wont hear from him for weeks or months.
I dont believe im putting any pressure on the relationship when were together, everytime its progressed its been because he wanted it to. 
I guess i am just looking for an explanation as to what may be going through his head when this is happening because he is unable to tell me. And i dont know what im supposed to do.
I have never had a relationship so perfect when he is well, this is the only thing interfering with our relationship. He also doesnt like himself very much and thinks he is a bad boyfriend despite me assuring him he isnt

Hi, 
I’m seeking some support and advice - I’m a first time mum with a 9 week old baby and have been feeling very overwhelmed, stressed and anxious lately. The sleep deprivation that comes with new parenthood has been a hard adjustment and I find myself feeling anxious every afternoon fearing how unsettled my baby will become that night. I’ve become frustrated and angry at my baby when I’ve been unable to settle her and most nights I lock myself in the toilet crying while my baby cries in the cot. My partner helps out when he can, but he works at 5am everyday so I usually combat the night time periods alone while he sleeps. He also has also just been diagnosed with depression, so I feel guilty for expecting more from him. In addition, we have just moved into a new house which has caused a lot of stress and pressure on the both of us and is taking a lot of adjustment. Most days I feel so tired and overwhelmed that I just sit in lonely silence in the new home holding my crying baby. I feel like I’m struggling to get through each day and don’t know what to do.

When I had major depression I wanted to learn from people who had experienced it and recovered. I am such a person and I write this in case it will give you hope.Let me start by telling you how sick I was before describing my current life and aspects of my journey.When I was 26, my life was derailed my major depression. I had been a hard working and ambitious professional with a high paying job and a bright future. Depression surfaced after personal and professional disappointments and loomed as insomnia, loss of appetite and disinterest in life. Ultimately, I was so depressed I was unable to cope at work and eventually found myself in a mental health facility. During this time, I experienced psychosis, mania (that has resulted in me being diagnosed/labeled as bipolar although the mania lasted 24 hours) and OCD in spite of being medicated. Back then holistic help for a mentally unwell person like me was hard to find. I was out of work for about 6 months and when I got back to work, I realized that the work was unrewarding and that depression had stigmatized me.Today, 30 years later I can report on having a rewarding and fulfilling life. I have a very loving wife and two wonderful children. I enjoy my work very much, believe that I do a good job and am paid quite well. I am a fundamentally different person to the one I was 30 years ago and am proud of my achievements and ability to withstand adversity. Depression caused me to develop a value system that evolves around the notions of contribution and appreciation.It has not been easy. During these 30 years, I have had times of severe emotional, social and professional distress. I have had acute OCD symptoms that have been successfully treated with CBT. I have taken medication all these years. I drink too much. Each day I manage myself to ensure that my emotional situation is balanced and does not adversely impact my colleagues or loved ones. Because I have a genetic predisposition, my children are also predisposed -- that is a sad reality.When I was very sick, I felt anxious and neurotic and wondered whether I had a future. Your Doctor will tell you that he knows that you will recover and he is right. If you have any questions or want me to expand on anything, I can. If I can do it, you can too!

Christmas eve, last year, i heard my fiancee taking photos in the bathroom after her shower. After i confronted her about about it, she lied to me saying it was just of her face. I immediately started to freak out as prior to this she had put a lock on her phone, something she had never done in the whole 9 years of being together. After questioning her further she reluctantly told me she had been sending explicit photos to someone she met online.
I spent the next couple of weeks in an emotional instability. The world continued on without me, as i spent every night crying and staring into the dark, wondering why.
I made her block the person on all social media and thought that would be the end of it. She told me she would never speak to him again. She lied. Later that week I noticed she unblocked him. After further questioning she told me it was more than just photos between them. For about a month she had been having a relationship with him. She told me she only unblocked him to tell him that i found out about what they were doing. 
The images of what they had done poisoned my mind and haunt me still to this day. I asked her to tell me what they did and said specifically as it couldn't have been worse than what i was imagining.
 It was. 
She told this person shes never met that she loved him and that that when their relationships broke down they would finally be together.
It turns out he also had a partner on which he was cheating on. I didn't think it fair for his girlfriend to go on not knowing so I told her of his betrayal. She didn't want to believe me until I provided evidence. I had none and told her to question him about it. His response was evidence enough for her.
Now since finding out the whole truth about what my fiancee had done, I'm frightened ill never feel the same again. I've thought about it everyday since and sometimes the depression hits me so hard i just brake down wherever i am. I feel so alone in my own relationship its hard to keep a healthy facade in public.
I don't want to leave the relationship, neither does she. She tells me she never stopped loving me and that she doesn't know why she did it. I want to work on things with her.
I just need to know, can couples have a healthy, lasting relationship after something like this and will my depression ever disappear?

Hey all. 
I’ve been struggling lately with just feeling a bit flat and unmotivated. This comes and goes every so often as the months go on, but mostly when I’m tired and have a lot going on. I don’t necessarily feel depressed, and I don’t know if this is a stupid thing to say, but I really don’t want to be depressed and the thought of depression makes me feel frightened and anxious. Not entirely sure why. But anyway... I don’t feel overly sad or anything, my biggest thing right now is that when I think of the future, I feel a bit overwhelmed and like I just don’t have the energy for it. I’m 22 and have pretty big goals for the future, so am I just maybe overwhelmed knowing all the work that has to go into them? 
I just feel quite unmotivated and a tad down lately. I have just had surgery on my shoulder and so I’ve had a month off work and am only just getting my normal routine back now but I’m still unable to partake in my regular physical activities like gymnastics and dancing just yet. Do you think what I’m feeling is situational, anxiety over the future, or should I see a GP for a mental health check?
Thanks guys. Don’t know if I’ve put this in the right place or answered my own questions, but it’s just my first post.

I have been fighting depression and anxiety for about 10 years now. I have tried several medications been to multiple 
psychologists / psychiatrists but nothing seems to help. I feel as if im in the worst place I have ever been. 

I have been with my partner for 10 years and been married for 3 years. We have 2 young children together (3yo and 1yo). About 8 years ago I almost called our relationship off but we stayed together. Over the years I feel as if we have drifted apart and don't feel as if we love each other any more. We don't argue or fight and she is a good person / mother to our kids. We have no time to spend together (due to work and 2 young kids) and my motivation to do anything social is non existent. I feel if she asks me to go somewhere or do something together or with friends that I have to say yes. Then when we are there all I want to do is go home. I just don't think that I can give her what she needs / wants and give her the life that she deserves.  I feel trapped in a marriage but don't want to split up because of the kids. Plus I'm worried that if we did split up that I would end up regretting it down the track. 

I have few of my own friends, no hobbies or interests so I have nothing much to look forward to.  My motivation to see my friends or find a hobby is at an all time low. I am living ground hog day, get up, go to work, come home, deal with kids (nappies dinner bath bed) then go to bed myself as im tired after work and have to get up tomorrow and do it all again. 

I have problems with self doubt / self esteem, feel guilty about lots of things, have trouble saying no to people and am not great at communication.  I struggle to put my thoughts and feelings into words when speaking to anyone (my wife, my family, my friends). I have no one to vent to and even if I did am more likely to keep things to myself. After a while it really weighs you down. 

Basically I'm going down hill fast and think it can only end in self destruction.  I have tried so long to beat this but now think that I can't win. 

I don't want to be a burden on my wife and think she would be better off without me / doesn't deserve me. 

I don't know what to do.

Hello, new to this site
I have been have some mood swings recently. I'll be fine when I wake up, then I'll suddenly slip into a dark mind frame without any warning.                     I don't mean to sound dramatic, I know mood swings are experienced by everyone and it's quite normal. The only reason I have thought to post this is because it's been a consistent problem for a bit over a month and occurs multiple times a day. It puts me back into one of the worst mind frames I've ever had - I just want to make sure I'm not blowing thing out of proportion before I seek help (I'll have to take days off attending uni if I decide to see someone).
 I have bipolar (therefore have had experience with depression and anxiety), is this kind of mood swings normal or should I be worried that my mood disorder is acting up? 
(Note:my bipolar has never behaved like this before)
Thank you to any and all who reply to this and feel free to leave your own experiences in your reply, we might even be able things help eachother :)

Hi all, ive been feeling really down and out since the start of this year despite good things happening for me aka work and study! I feel like i have no solid support mentally and physically and im just completely broken everyday, im exhausted, sore and my body is telling me enough! Im lonely, single and live by myself my parents are good but they also busy with their individual lives too. Ive tried dating and a few times it makes me feel much better and capable of many things having someone by my side but alas it doesnt ever seem to work out or it fades out from their end.
i just need some help to get to the otherside of this, because for once i cant see how to get out of this 😩

I feel absolutely lost and think l may have been struggling with depression for about 17 Years.
On the outside people wouldn't even know, l pretend to smile but on the inside, l am an absolute mess.
17 Years ago l gave birth to a beautiful baby and than my father died, since that day l would say the only days l have actually smiled and been truly happy was the days l have given birth to my babies.
My husband makes me feel like shit and unattractive, l feel like l only hear from friends when they need something.
Feel like l am not worth anything to anybody.
Tried depression tablets 17 years ago and counselling but nothing works.
In the past week, l have never felt so depressed, alone, unloved

I don't know where to start. Nothing makes a me happy and nobody seems to care.
My partner is not understanding what is wrong with me. I guess I can't really pinpoint it either. 
I am yearning for something better. Financially we are treading water. I want to move but can't make a decision where. But Im not wanting to do that to my kids. Having to change schools etc.
 Brother invited all family to go to Bali for his 40th knowing I don't fly so that's crap..partner wouldn't go anyway cos he ia negative towards most of my family and friends.
Parents don't contact me unless they want something. 
I am a sah mum but need to get back into workforce. Don't know how when I just want to sleep all day. I have no motivation. 
I just want to be happy again.

In mid-2013, I started feeling weird in the head and had a lot of anxiety attacks. My energy went down, and I spent most of the day in bed, and ended up missing a lot of uni classes.
The feeling inside my head is really weird, like surreal, in a dream. It's like anxiety in the sense that it starts small, insignificant and sticks at the back of my mind all the time then snowballs into something frightening, bleak and even threatening. But it's more a psychological symptom than physical.
Thoughts that bring on these uncomfortable, scary episodes are: how will I support myself away from parents, how can I prevent myself from living on the streets unless I have a good landlord, what will happen after my parents/ loved ones pass away, when will I ever get a proper, decent paying job? 
These thoughts go on for a while and trigger me and I get emotionally upset, then I go into derealisation mode. I get these episodes even in my sleep if I nap during the day (the derealisation doesn't seem to occur when I sleep at night).
So in 2013, I got these weird feelings and thought it was just anxiety and depression, so I was put on anti-depressants. Now I think I was actually suffering from derealisation all this time, although I'm happy to stay on the antidepressants. In recent years, I've gained control over my thought process and managed to live daily life mostly painfree. 
The derealisation episodes still happen, and they happen mostly at night.
Does anyone else deal with this? I'm keen to know if there's other people suffering from this horrible psychological symptom.

I’m at a point where I don’t know what to do. My depression and anxiety have reached a severe point after the birth of my first child 4 years ago. I’m in such a dark place and know I’m not easy to handle nor the situation but my husband just doesn’t seem to understand my condition. Tonight I got the comment of “I need to do more to get better” despite the fact I go to a psychologist and psychiatrist and am on medication. Yet he doesn’t want me to go into hospital. 
I just feel so unsupported and starting to feel alone in my marriage. He won’t come with me to see my psychologist to get a better understanding of what goes on in my head. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how Im meant to be in a marriage with someone who can’t be that calm in the storm or doesn’t try to understand this disease. 
has anyone else had this experience?

I’ve recently lost a family member extremely close to me, and had my partner walk out on me all within the span of two weeks. I’m broken, lost and scared. I’ve been extremely low before but never this low. I don’t know how to keep myself occupied, I have moved to a new town and don’t know anybody. I am alone and it’s taking its toll.
is there anything I can do to keep myself busy and attempt to find a positive state of mind? My partner was extremely degrading and mentally abusive, to the point I was afraid to sleep in the same room to avoid being told how worthless I am. They constantly bragged about the attention they received from other people, and how much better they were off without me. When they left they were very heartless and that’s what pushed me down further. 
I am trying to grieve the loss of someone who is no longer on this earth, and the loss of someone who walked away. I don’t know which is worse. I gave more than I had in me to this person and I feel as though it was never enough.
how do I get out of this horrible state of mind

I dont know what to say, I have never posted before. Until recently I didnt know I was depressed, I just thought I was unlucky in life and a good person so thats why people use me. I thought eventually if I was a good person and worked hard that life would work out for the best but now Im 35 and alone with a terrible life. 
My friends only reach out if i reach out first, I feel so alone. I now avoid functions because its awkward especially when i get asked ""how have you been"" what can I say? I have been shit and my life is over which will ruin the mood. Everyone wants you to be happy all the time.
I went into real estate and was actually good at it but made the decision I wanted to get better and improve my career only to hit the wall of bad times over and over again. I see many people doing well who are horrible people and do unlawful things yet they have good lives and i have nothing trying to do the right thing. Had a ""friend"" offer me the world when his office went down hill and wanted my help while he was over seas to help the office, only to stuff me around and not offer me a job after I was there for 2 months. Now Im in a shit job doing labouring where the boss treats me like rubbish so mentally im drained. I have to accept it so i get a pay cheque as Im very poor now which makes me cry that Im such a disappointment that I have to put up with bad people. 
To add to it, my girlfriend just gave up on me because she couldnt see a happy like with me. She wanted the big dates and fun times yet I couldnt be that person all the time in a state like this. She just saw my bad luck and depression as excuses, maybe I should have opened up about my depression months ago but how do you start that conversation with someone that wants you to be happy?
I just dont know where to go from here. My friend just reached out and I told him about work and the breakup but he just ran, no one likes the conversation so again, I am alone. I guess this is my life and I need to accept it, some people are not meant to be happy. But I dont know if this is the life I can accept, lucky I have my 2 dogs to keep me company so I have to stay on this path to provide for them. 

I just dont know what to do to be happy or if being happy is possible.. sorry for the rant guys, I just had to speak and could cry to myself any more

I realised a couple years ago that I have no real friends. Every single person I considered a friend only ever talked to me when I approached them. Only ever contacted me when they wanted something. They often say they'd love to catch up but are conveniently indisposed (or didn't see my messages) when I'm in town ... I spiraled after a event involving someone who I thought was a real friend. And I realised after that I have no friends. I was so miserable that I did something I never did before, I told everyone I was struggling and sought them out (as friends are supposed to be there for you right? I guess not if you were never their real friends to begin with it seems) ... and they all disappeared (some straight away, others took a month or two) ... until I was literally alone. 

This broke my heart. And I don't know what to do. I often walk by the man who made me realise this. Before my misery drove everyone away he was like my best friend. We'd catch up every week ... it was awkward catchups because we are both awkward people, but that's why I liked him so much. It was like we are both the same kind of outsider (but unlike me everyone seems to love him) ... but now he pretends he doesn't' see me when our paths cross. I saw him just yesterday, and he literally looked up at me, his face turned dark and than he looked away. I realise that this is my fault. I freaked him right out with my misery, when I realised I alienated him my last words to him was that I'd never bother him again but if he wanted to catch up I'm always here. That was probably 18 months ago. Occasionally he'll wave from a afar if he sees me, but mostly he pretends he doesn't see me. And this is devastating. He was my last friend on this crappy world.

I've tried to move on. Make new friends, a new canvas. I have pretty bad social anxiety too, so anything to do with people is hard, but I try and it's the same old story. The best I can hope for is people humouring me ... I feel like one those chronically unlikable ladies who goes around talking to strangers cause nobody else will. I don't even think I'm unlikable, I'm awkward sure, and different, I have trouble talking. But I'm friendly, and have stack of interesting hobbies that other folk usually rave about. But I'm always ""that"" person, ""that freak."" 

I'm so lonely.  Would like some advice on how to make a real friend. 
I'm on the autism spectrum btw ... so I'm sure that ads to my creepiness that repels the rest of humanity

For the last 6-8 months I've felt really sad and miserable. I've constantly felt like everyone's against me and that they all hate me. Sometimes I just wonder if I'm good enough and if all this is my fault. 
i always seem to do something wrong, my parents are always mad and me. I tried taking to my dad but he was flying off to London the next day and we haven't talked about it since.

So firstly i just thought i'd give you a quick rundown on whats happened etc
Ive had sleeping issues for years, since about 17 years old.. And i never really understood why, and then they would go away and then they would come back, and anyway i started a new job last year at the start of the year and i was getting really anxious at work, and panic attacks blah blah blah. I had one of those samsung watches, i knew i was anxious, but i was unsure how extreme. The watch was telling me my watch was getting up to about 190bpm and i was like wow, i dealt with it for a while and then it started getting more panic wise and i would make mistakes at work and my throat was getting tight etc etc
Anyway, they tried to treat me with medication to help treat the anxiousness and the sleep and I literally put on 4kg in 1 week, my appetite when absolutely effing crazy, i could not stop eating. So i told the doctor no.. im not taking these (really self concious about weight)
And then they gave me this other one, did the same thing, helped with sleep for about 3 days, stopped working for sleep and made me super hungry. So i said no again... Then, i got put on another medication.. Well... Then we uncovered a bipolar disorder that i have, that i didnt really know was a thing. Since then, i have been taking some other medications instead, and i feel like i dont eat? Like i literally feel like i dont eat as much as i should. But i keep putting on weight? I dont drink much soft caloric softdrinks, mainly pepsi max if i do. When i can actually go to work, i walk like 5-6km in a night, but the weight around the stomach still keeps appearing. I literally feel if i eat one thing bad, or one thing too creamy, or too cheesy that i just chuck it straight on? The point of this post... If there is anybody out there with bipolar battling this same issue, is there something that will help my situation that i can speak to my doctor about? Now that i actually notice my super fast stupid cycling, and im down... It is literally hard to even think about cooking or being healthy, or even washing clothes, and when i go high... I feel like im on amphetamines? And i dont really eat too much at all, and i clench my jaw like no tomorrow till the point it gets so sore, go fully hyperfocus...
I have googled alternate medications for bipolar disorder, but EVERY single one says weight gain.. And im really honestly stuck between being unstable and manic, or being fat and even more depressed. Thanks

I spent nearly a decade out of high school in the construction industry. I did everything ""right"". I finished my apprenticeship and found full time employment (or so I thought). After a while I realised that I was making far less than my peers. I consulted with FairWork and found I was being severely exploited in a sham contracting situation. My boss had been having a field day due to my naivety. I started standing up for my rights and was ostracized and bullied by my boss and co-workers to the point where I started losing the will to be here and quit.
I took another job out of sheer desperation and was coerced into another sham contract. This time I was fired and nastily abused on the phone after I said no to being ordered to climb on a roof with no safety equipment by another ""sub contractor"". I then had to threaten legal action and asked FairWork for assistance to get paid for my last week of work as the boss didn't pay me and stopped answering his phone. FairWork were useless and did nothing about anything.
I'm now studying at uni in hopes of bettering my future but I can't work with a full uni schedule and AusStudy only covers my groceries and half of my utility bills. I'm living on a small amount of inheritance from my beautiful grandma who passed recently which I feel horribly guilty about and when that runs out, I'll have no money at all.
Luckily my dad is helping to the best of his ability and I'm blessed with a beautiful and understanding GF but I don't know if she'll stick around if I can't even afford to buy food.
I just don't really see the point in trying anymore. I feel like a failure and like society has massively failed me at the same time. It's like I'm a cog in the huge, dirty, stinking machine that is our economy and when I started squeaking too much I was taken out and thrown into the mud with the other rubbish. I don't talk to my friends anymore because they all became narcissistic robots who only care about competing with each other on social media to see who has the best holidays/stuff. It makes me sick. I don't derive enjoyment from the things I used to. My libido is gone. The few people I try to talk to (apart from my girlfriend) just tell me how ""lucky"" I am compared to *insert other disadvantaged group*. I feel so alone and taken advantage of. I have horrible social anxiety due to my low (non existent) occupational status for my age. I can't sleep most nights. I don't know what to do and I don't see any point in any of this.

It has been going on for about a year but everyday I feel more and more apathetic to the point where I simply don't care anymore. The excitements i used to have for work and the future is gone. My performance was slipping at work, so I have resigned but I have no motivation to get up in the morning and try to find another job about a month ago.
I barely stay in touch with my old friends and my hobbies no longer interest me. The only thing that I am still consistently doing is playing poker casually but I'm wondering if that is becoming an addiction.
It just feels that the only time anyone speaks to me is when they want something and I am just fed up with everything. I'm not sure what to do next or where to turn or what to do next. I wouldn't say that I'm feeling anxious, more so flat and defeated and it ist just coming up to my mid 20's birthday.

This book was recommended by a psychologist to me as part of treatment - but it is terrible!
I am not sure whether I am just reading it wrong or expected something different (I have never read a self-help book before) but I struggle to get past some of the awful metaphors used i.e. planting a banana in Antarctica and being surprised you never harvest more bananas.  Bananas don't have seeds that can be grown into trees, it makes me doubt whether any of the advice given is of any use at all.
More examples:  the book stresses that ""people who expect to get sick get sick"" but it's clearly a load of tosh, with no evidence given, but stated as some kind of fact as if projecting wellness onto yourself is going to protect you from bacteria or germs or whatever.  Or that people that have accidents have some kind of self-harm death wish that regularly manifests itself by forcing you to climb rickety ladders.
Anyway, I'm not sure how to go back to the psychologist and tell him the book is rubbish.  He has been helpful so far, but spending $25 on some kind of drippy pile of unsupported anecdotes and drivel has annoyed the daylights out of me.
Has anybody else read this book and got something useful out of it?

I've had longstanding depression since at least I was 16, but it wasn't actually diagnosed until I was 30. This latest dive into the depths doesn't seem to be going away. I had a visit from the acute mental health team a few days ago. When I said I didn't feel any better, the doctor said I seemed a lot brighter. An assessment from a 4 or 5 minute visit. I have to force my self to do most things, eat, go out all the normal stuff. Today I went to a music group to play the guitar. Came home and cried for about 2 or 3 hours because I don't fit in there or anywhere. These mental health team guys think they have the right to comment on everything. I had 2 painting I'd done on the wall. When I said I hadn't painted for over 2 years one guy said you've got paints on your desk so you must have been doing some painting. I suppose I was lying. Then one wanted to known why I had 3 guitars. I said I like guitars, when I really felt like saying is it any of your business. Playing the guitar is all I have left. At least I'm not being let down.

Im a 25yo Youth Worker, which is ironic as Im struggling with being an adult.
I hate having to work. I dont hate my job, I just hate having to have a job at all. I end up crumbling when Ive been working consistently and my depression kicks in and I stay in bed for a week or two to ""recover"". Then I go back to earning my money until I crumble again. This is a monthly cycle on average.
I didnt go to high school and I rarely went to primary school, so its not programmed into me to ""have to"" do things I don't want to do and I havent been able to reprogram that part of myself, only do my best despite it (which is all we can do.) 
I love being a ""housewife"" but it's not realistic in this modern economy and doesnt align with my dreams and aspirations (which revolve around travelling, art and investing so I have income without working) but those dreams and aspirations barely push me through, they're more like a thing that I remind myself I will never have if I don't do what I have to do. Perhaps a threat rather than a motivator. 
Before I got into work and study and more work, I was a carer for my mother so even then I was able to do what I wanted most of the time and be at home in my own world, without financial pressure. I still went through depression through all these other points in my life but I also had the luxury of staying in bed and not having to worry about ruining my life or money. 
I feel like deep down Im the same person who is at their best filling their day with whatever they please in solitude, even with the mental health issues, however now I have very real pressures of life and I have to masquerade around as a functioning adult.
My partner and I both make OK money but the sad reality in this day and age, is that even with two ""good"" wages we're still only living within our means, meaning that I hardly see the reward from forcing myself to go to work because we are still not in a position to travel or invest, or even buy myself new clothes. Whilst I'm grateful that the rent is paid and we eat well, the fact that those other things are still so far out of reach is demotivating when I've already got the blues. Then there's the guilt for wanting more when there's others who wish they had what I do.
I just wish I could go to work like a normal person without this inner turmoil. Even when I try to push through, eventually my anxiety pops out to take over and I will have a panic attack before a shift so draining that I end up needing a week off anyway.

I'm 13 weeks pregnant with our no 2. Since the beginning of the pregnancy (even before I knew I am pregnant) I've been having a bad mood and easy to get angry, especially with our 4 yo son. 
This pregnancy is not planned. We decided to have only one kid, because we have no family or relatives here to help when you need them. I'm a bit angry when I know about the pregnancy, but also excited to give our son a sibling. Husband is happy since he wants big family.
On my 1st appointment to GP, I told her that I feel angry and sad all the time and ask me whether I need a referral to see someone or not. I said, I will try to handle it. 2 weeks ago I met my midwife, and she run a test for me. The anxiety test was fine, but the depression test come as high.
I'm a stay at home mom. I just feel tired all the time. The days just passed without doing anything, then I can't get a good sleep at night time.
I feel so bad because I didn't manage the house as I should do. I just cook because I need to. Sometimes we only do takeaway and feed my family plus the baby with junk food. Sometimes my husband helps with cooking when he has time. He's a taxi driver with long working hours plus he also study in TAFE for cert III. I know he also tired and overwhelm with his own activities.
The worst part is I keep angry to my son for everything. I know it's normal for 4 yo to not listen and you need to repeat yourself 100,000 times. But I don't have that passion anymore. I keep angry and screaming to him multiple times in a day. Yesterday he asked me to stop fighting with him with sad face. I don't want to be a bad mom to him. At night I will hug him and say I love you, but it's not fair for him to get all this anger from me. I can also see that now he's  behaviour a bit change. When he doesn't like something he start to clench his fists and grit his teeth.
I don't know what to do. Even when I think about it, I shouldn't complain about my life, everything is good and ok. Before pregnant I do exercise 2-3 a week, but at the moment doctor ask me to not do anything other than light jogging. The exercise before help me to be happy and alive.
Please help me.

So, earlier last year I attempted suicide. I resent my family for calling the police on me. Over the past few months, I have tried throwing myself into work, but it isn't helping. I have started self-medicating again, feeling the same loss as before, and am feeling truly alone. What family I have are reliant on me for emotional support, and I can't deal with both their situations as well as my own. As a result of this, I don't know who to turn to. There seems to be a paywall to any actual help available to me. And when I have found help in the past, I automatically jump into the 'everything is fine' mode where I lie to both myself and professionals about own wellbeing, just so I can slip under the radar again and avoid attention.
I don't know what to do, what services to turn to, or how to cope at the moment. Any advice about services or facilities would be welcome, as each day is becoming more and more of a challenge.

Hi, 
I’m unsure where to start really, I’m 22 years old and I am 26 weeks pregnant. I am happy to be having my son and I can’t wait to meet him but my partner just isn’t very supportive. He’s 21 and we have completely different views on things. He dosnt give me a chance to ever explain myself, I basically have to walk on egg shells and keep my mouth shut and just agree to everything he says or he snaps and I get called all the names under the sun “ dumb bitch” “slut” “the only good thing about you is your carrying my son” I honestly am just feeling so worthless and I want to give this little fella the best life possible. I’m currently not working so my only income is my partner. We live together so with our dog and recently our dog got in a fight with another dog so my partner believes in beating our dog as punishment..... I do not believe in this and cry and scream and grab the dog and try and stop it untill he eventually stops. Idk this is a bit all over the shop but I just do not know where to go from here. It’s that easy to say “leave him” but we’ve been together so long; we are now having a child together and when we have our good moments together they are really good.

Intrigued to know  if anyone has been diagnosed with the above named illness, I think its relatively new
but usually amongst people who have unipolar depression but have bipolar in the family aswell. I would like
to hear some stories of hope as i've had a mixed experience ( to say the least ) the past couple of years.

My babies Mr 5 and Miss 4 take a private bus to school and home again so I can work school hours. They are the only little kids on the bus.
Yesterday our son reluctantly told us older kids slapped, bit and scratched him as a game even though he told them to stop. His ear was bleeding.

Confiding in us took guts so we acted by speaking to the bus driver about keeping any little kids at the front where he can see them. Documenting and alerting the school and we had a meeting this morning because this is unacceptable.

Today they went on the bus again. We waited for the bus at the school gate to meet our kids (and eye off each of the teenage asshats that hurt him for fun). A silent threat.
My heart aches and I want to protect but my gut also says he needs to learn we will act to keep him safe but he must also learn to guard himself by staying with his peer group and knowing if someone touches him to speak up loudly because that is not permitted.

But watching your little one slowly realising not everyone is kind or nice hurts. 
Hearing your five year old say that a boy said that ""it's ok if we hit you because you're just a little toy"" made me want to vomit. 
In the school meeting I just sobbed and couldn't speak. It feels so revolting. The school is taking it seriously but I have lost faith. There were young adults on that bus that watched and did nothing. Not even a word to the driver. Nothing.
I am proud of how he bounced back and is back to his usual feral and happy self. But I am broken and hopeless. Tears keep threatening. 
How do you teach small children the world is a positive place when you need to teach them to develop resilience and defence?
How do you feel hopeful for their future with proof people stand back and watch and do nothing?

Hi I’m a high schooler and I don’t know whether or not I’m depressed. I keep all my problems to myself and usually cry myself to sleep. During the day I often have end up exhausted and don’t feel like doing anything I still smile and laugh and play but it doesn’t last long. I hate myself and don’t really know why I’m still trying to do anything. But I’m worried that I’m just being an attention seeker because nothing particularly bad has happened in my life. I feel I may just be dramatic and making this bigger than it is and I’m wondering whether or not I’m actually depressed. I don’t see many reasons why I should be but  and I feel there are so many more people who have been through terrible things but I’m just some dramatic attention seeker who is making a big deal out of nothing. What do you think am I actually depressed or just dramatic because I don’t know.

For a while, well maybe a very long time. I have been wondering my my mood keeps going up and down a lot. While some days are really bad, i don't want to do anything. I don't want to go anywhere.. I just want to stay at home away from people and just do nothing. I have made a appointment with a counsellor but it will not be for another two weeks until i can see them. I find my self struggling with eating and trying to get through my uni work. To be motivated to do anything, but for some reason i keep going round this cycle of not wanting to do anything. I have also notice i have distance myself from most of my friends and i am afraid to tell them what i am feeling as they got their own problems to deal with i don't think it would be right to add mine on top. So my question is this.. Other than forcing myself to eat, to exercise, wait for my counsellor appointment.. What can i do to get my self wanting to get up in the morning and to do everything i need to do? I have talked about this with my boyfriend and he seems to be very supportive of me. But i am not sure where to go from here..

Hi, 
I have just gotten back from seeing my GP for a mental health care plan. After almost 2 years of what I believe is a relapse in my depression. 
This time though, I couldn't put on a brave face, I kept crying and shaking. 
He has referred to to an affordable psychologist which is a month wait... I don't think I can deal with another month battling with myself. I'm at breaking point in my friendships and relationship. I just don't know what to do from here.

Hello,
I can’t  find any motivation and I can’t seem to stop crying.
I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago but have been really good for the past 12 months even going off my medication.
But I have felt a change the last couple of weeks. This weekend is a long weekend and I had so many exciting plans and I don’t want to do anything  except stay in bed. I then feel annoyed with myself and start crying for no reason.
does anyone have any advise please?
Thank you.

Hi everyone. This is my first time here posting. My depression has come to ahead and I need to start talking.
Firstly - my current state: I'm 6 days out of gradually coming off antideppresants which I have been on for almost 10 years. Last night I slept a total of four hours. I spent the night with all lights on, seeing things in the dark, crying and terrified to sleep for fear of vivid nightmares. My head is a fog and brain zaps are every few minutes. My head throbs for all the crying done followed by enhaustion and calm for 30 minutes. I'm scared that I don't have a deadline for withdrawals. When will it end? Will it get worse?
I had to leave work today as I simply for fear that at any given moment I would explode in rage at someone or Biratnagar into uncontrollable sobbing. I feel sick thinking how on earth will I ever control myself? Is this the end of a burgeoning career? You cannot simply put work and life on hold - people depend on you. How can I possibly be so weak?
I don't know if this is just withdrawals talking or I am still stuck in the hole that is depression and I worry how I will cope with life now that I have decided to look for other ways to handle my mental wellbeing rather than numbing myself with medicine. I don't know what my real feelings look like now.
As a chronic over-anayliser prone to bouts of overwhelming sadness and anxiety, I feel like in at the start of a dark highway heading in a direction I'm unsure of, not knowing what's at the end. Where to start? How to begin to calm myself? To feel again? How to get up and take on a new day? I think perhaps I might like to speak with someone for guidance however my last time reaching out for help this way I felt intimidated and pressured to speak leaving me having a panic attack and running out of the building!

I would be very interested to learn about personal experiences with laughter therapy.  I know little about the subject although I do find when I watch movies that make me laugh it has a profound effect on my mood.  I suspect there is a chemical reaction in the brain but that is beyond my understanding.  I am careful about the type of comedy I watch though as some has some rather dark undertones and/or self deprecating aspects that have the opposite affect ... speaking for myself.

I have to say a huge thankyou , 
a couple of years ago I was diagnosed with severe depression , I was going through a marriage breakup , severe financial issues and away from my family , 
i did the beyond blue test online and knew I needed help , I made Drs appointment took a week to get in and was thinking of cancelling the appointment as I couldn't see any way forward and thought about how I would end my life , but something made me do the test again and same result , so i kept the appointment , 
I was a mess , but the dr was great and I ended up at mental health where the staff were fantastic , now 2 years later with the help of these amazing people and anti depressants I'm in a much happier place ,  
I've been weaned off the antidepressants and had my last tablet last week , feeling great and I totally urge people to get help ,  
the amount of support I received from family and friends and even strangers was amazing , I never hid the fact that I needed antidepressants to survive .
its a part of life for many people and nothing to be embarrassed about at all , I never knew there are so very many people out there that support you and help you get through it all .
I am so very thankful for your help beyond blue without your tests I very much doubt I'd be here in such a happy place today , if I ever slip back to where I was 2 years ago , I would still go and get the help needed . 
Thankyou you saved my life

I decided to join a forum after reading the book The Buddha and the Borderline. I cant even describe how much I related to her. I am a self diagnosed borderline and I want to get better, I have been working at getting better for over a decade but I am trapped when it comes to childhood memories. I believe if I could rid myself of them, Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind style, I could find balance and happiness. They pull me down. I cant let them go. They shape every aspect of my adult life. Im more than ready to move on and be the creator of my own life. To put the past abuses aside and grow from them. But Im trapped. In order to become a better person, I have to be self aware of my behaviour. And by doing this Ive been made aware that my behaviour is a reaction to an extreme prolonged childhood of abuse. I found that colored my entire personality. Its my identity. I have run from it, then tried to face it, then told myself over and over the reasons people do horrible things to kids and try to humanize them but Im still angry. I havent moved past that rage.
I need advice on how to get rid of memories. Or how to tolerate them when they come at me and wont leave for days.  
I want to be Zen. I want peace. I want to be a person that I like without those harsh voices in my head screaming at me that I am completely worthless and to suck it up and everyone has problems but my anger is holding me back.
How do you let go of something that was avoidable that ruined youre whole entire life, personality, thoughts, veiws of the world. How do you let go of extreme anxiety when you have to leave the house and trust that the world is safe(ish)? How do you snap yourself out of the deepest depression when even going to the toilet is exhausting? What do you do when you are desperately trying to get better and you have toxic people in your life telling you its a waste of time, you will never get better, you are delusional, worthless? I would love to cut them out of my life but cant. I dont say anything now and work in secret but how do I tune out all the words coming at me, telling me Im wasting my time. 
I feel like the reason they dont want me to get better is because they dont want to be exposed. 
I need to block over 30 years worth of critisism and hate and violence and words. Coming to terms with it and accepting it is fleeting. I feel differently about it day to day. But today I am angry so here I am.
Thanks.

Hi
Since I was 14 I have had mild anxiety and have been able to cope with counselling. However, recently my anxiety became crippling. Every morning I wake up earlier then my alarm feeling anxious. I have constant worrying all day and I feel so tired all the time. I have been doing mindfulness meditation, eating healthy, taking walks when I can and journalling. I have an appointment with a physiologist, but that isn't for another 10 days. 
I went to the doctors who has put me on medication and found out that I also have depression. As I have some other symptoms like not enjoying anything, crying and feeling hopeless. It scares me so bad. Will I ever feel hope and happy again? 
Even now my family have come and visited me and I am here writing this so I don't cry in front of my niece and nephew instead of enjoying the time with them. 
I feel like I can't go a day without talking to someone about this, like beyond blue, headspace or even lifeline. 
I feel so scared, alone, tired and hopeless.

I've suffered from severe depression and anxiety for over 10 years. I have spent much of my life on welfare living day-to-day. I've given up on having a financially secure existence and see it as a joke now. That's not to say that I haven't been employed. I've worked mostly in call centers that are, for lack of a better term, soul-crushing environments. Demanding KPI requirements (often impossible) and job insecurity would have had a massive impact on my mental health, more so than I gave credit for at the time.
I've been poor for so long that I've just become used to precariatism and I think I underestimate the impact my financial situation has on my anxiety. I've been taking steps to improve my life but have hit a roadblock in terms of what I can achieve within the limits of my financial situation. I'm currently studying at University but most of the students in my degree are significantly younger than me and they don't really socialise. Uni also doesn't pay. I want a job; not just for the money but also for somewhere to go and to be part of a group. I need the structure, I need the socialisation. My experiences with employment have been so negative, my brain has wired itself to be extremely pessimistic when it comes to jobseeking. It also doesn't help when there are seemingly no jobs anywhere suitable for me. Everything on seek.com etc is call centers, sales, hospitality or requires previous experience or transport. I don't drive and my only experience is in a field I would rather not re-enter (call centers). I'm 33 now and it is very difficult to compete with hundreds of thousands of more well-adjusted younger people all fighting in a job market where there are not enough jobs in the first place.
I guess what I am getting at is I am wondering what options I have? My studies are my priority and I'm not looking for a job that is going to demand my complete devotion to the company. I just want something I can rock up to, do the job then go home. I need something that is low-stress, not because it's easy but because my brain literally cannot cope with that stress anymore. Something that I can do part-time or casual around my university schedule. Not having a job is slowly killing me. I want to work but have no idea how. Are there any places that exist that can help me find what I am looking for? Job providers don't assist you unless you are an active jobseeker on Newstart. They also don't really have an appreciation for mental health.

My thoughts

When you are sad, some memories can make you happy 
When you are depressed, memories just make you sad

Sadness brings tears, but then they go away
Depression brings tears, they stay and everything else goes away

If you are sad, friends can help
If you are depressed, what friends?

Sadness doesn’t affect your memory
Depression just makes you stupid

You are sad for a specific reason
You are depressed for no reason at all

Sadness passes and is forgotten
Depression stays forever, and is remembered forever

People provide comfort for free when you are sad 
Depression costs money

Empathy is easy for sadness
Pity is easy for depression

Everyone gets sad
Only you are depressed
The hard part is getting “people” to understand.

Even on days of clear blue, beautiful skies; the darkness comes calling
The inner monolog is so loud you cannot hear the outside world
The inane whispers and screams alike, drowning and falling
Lost in the self contained chaos with little to no wisdoms of pearl


No suicidal thought is spared
No more tears left to shed
When the darkness comes calling


Break down after a long day of trying to hold it together
Every scar, a seam that was slowly unraveling with anxiety tugging at loose threads
Crying in a heap, not a grey cloud above
Better off dead, better off dead



No suicidal thought spared
No more tears left to shed
When the darkness comes calling
No time like the present standing still
No more blood left to spill
When the darkness comes calling


Broken and beaten
Life is so fleeting
Pulling myself apart but not yet given up
Scratching and clawing
Begging for relief
Pounding of this beautifully broken heart


My tears have dusted over like antiquities of pain
Wounds grown over like tumours of tainted memories
One more incision is only a bad decision away
One more knot is not enough to choke away the misery


Even on days of clear blue, beautiful skies; the darkness comes calling
And even at my strongest I struggle to not say goodbye
It’s hard to keep ignoring when each call could be the end
No suicidal thought is spare, no more tears left to shed…

Hi. I've never reached out like this, but for the last while (could be weeks, could be months, I don't know anymore) I've felt just destroyed. Shattered. On the outside I look fine, but almost every time I get a moment of privacy I break down and either cry or have a panic attack. I've seen a psychologist about the panic but not about the other side of it. It's a crushing feeling in my chest and throat that never goes away. It makes me snappy and distant at my friends/family and I'm afraid of losing them if this keeps going, so I work really hard to hide this constant, soul-sapping feeling from those around me. I've never felt this low before, never been diagnosed with depression (only social anxiety and mild panic), and am looking for any advice. Thanks.

Hi all, 
I changed job recently and have struggled with the new job, due to the following:
- Constantly long hours (50 hours/week vs 38 hours stated on contract). I actually accepted the contract due to the stated hours because I was seeking for work-life balance as I need to look after a family member with disability.
- Lack of control over problems I get blamed for. Problems are caused by other teams or system issues that are beyond my scope/authority to change, but there's expectation for myself to always get it right. This results in working overtime to resolve issues created elsewhere.
- At times, incomplete communication or last-minute instruction change, meaning I could be working for certain tasks for days just to have to redo them all over again.
I've communicated above issues to my line manager, but this trend still continues, as my employer is very disorganised and slow to improve (for example, a critical project could be delayed for 10 years due to mismanagement).
The pay is decent, but it's repeatedly triggering my depression and anxiety. I dread going to work every morning and have to cover up my unhappiness during my interaction with collegues.
I barely have the mindspace and free time to do job hunt after getting home from work, so I usually do it on weekends only.
I've been tempted to quit without having anything lined up, but I'm concious employers prefer to recruit someone still employed. I did quit a job earlier in my career and found another job three months later, but at my current level of seniority, the competition is more intense, so I prefer to not risk it if possible.
I know that I need to toughen up and continue to search for a new job. It's just at times (like right now), I feel overwhelmed and I'm too ashamed to being opened about my depression.
I wonder if other members here have been in the same situation and what did you do to manage it.

Hi just wanted to get this off my mind
I just turned 21 on Saturday and had been planning my party for ages, spending money etc. which I really don't have as I just wanted a happy night. The night came and I was riddled with anxiety which only grew throughout the night. My friends weren't having fun and I was stressed and having a panic attack. People started leaving by 9pm which is bad and I could barely stay awake and keep myself from crying. By 10pm it was only my closest friends left and we pretty much went straight to bed. In the few days after until now I've been so depressed as my birthday sucked and I feel bad inviting people over for a bad night and I made myself and my parents help and stress so much and spend money we don't have on a party that turned out terrible. I didn't allow time for my family to spend time with me, didn't cut cake, didn't get my family's presents or anything and I just feel so terrible and told my mum i feel bad and could tell she felt like she did a good job and i was telling her that it sucked. It's all a mess and I feel horrible. I wish I had just had a family birthday without friends there instead of spending my time crying for the past 4 days.
 
Anyone else experienced the worst time?

I’m just an absolute mess. Watching my two beautiful kids sleeping. Crying my eyes out because my husband told me for the second time in as many months that he is thinking about separating and is unhappy in our marriage because I am overweight. ive always had weight gain issues - not going to make any excuse for it. After two kids I’ve gained a total of 26kgs (leaving me at 96kgs). i put everyone in our family before myself to ensure their happiness. And when I get a second to myself I just want to rest. I seriously just want to not have to think, just relax and have something to eat. 
Ive been battling with depression (and anxiety) since 2008 and have been medicated since. 
I don’t want to seperate. I love my husband so much. I love our family. I am frightened. And so hurt. So so hurt by what he has said about me, to me. 
How can you say that to your wife? 
and now I have thoughts that maybe I should leave him because of how hurtful his words have been. 
Hes acting like this doesn’t effect him at all. But he’s talking like he’s already preparing for a separation. 
Theres no support. There’s no checking on me to see if I’m ok. No word on how we’re going - if things are looking up or getting worse. Nothing. Just his life continues as normal. And I am absolutely shattered. 
I hate feeling this depressed. Please someone say something that is going to make it better. Please

Some days I have enough in me to think...give yourself a bloody good shake and then there are days like today. 
40+, 2 kids, a partner of 10+ years. But somehow it feels like it has all gone wrong.
I haven't taken to the 40+ club well. Mentally, I've found it depressing. I feel old, over-weight (still claiming baby fat after nearly 11 years) and unloved. 
My eldest has a medical condition that is managed for most part by meds, but he drains my partner and I and there are days, where he pushes us to the limit and it just seems ever more frequent as he heads to his teens.
My partner and I - there doesn't seem anything for us anymore. 3 years ago, there were discussions around a third baby before I got too old etc that has been stopped dead and that affected me too. Now there is just full time abstinence on one side so as to avoid any ""accidents."" It feels like just an existence and nothing more. A financial in-home convenience, because seperately, we would probably struggle as would most couples. I've put out there as recently as this mornig (seems to come to a head now with every argument) - to just bite the bullet and finish it up for the sake of the kids having to live in a argumentative environment, so he stands there and says - well...just go then..leave!..never taking any initiative or positive actions towards making it happen. And so the circle continues.....
I've been to sort out my will, I've got the estate agent coming today re. house sale & I've arranged with my employer to have my salary go into my own account now. I've done a spreadsheet of all our incomings and outgoings and who needs to take what on going forward. It will include the sale of big items, e.g. house.  There is never a discussion, he just says do what you want. 
I'm not sure why I'm on here, other than to say I feel like crap every day and it's a struggle to keep face at work or anywhere really, because I feel desperately sad all the time. I lost my mum last year. I lost my dad a few years back and my only brother and I no longer speak. Knowing that I wouldn't be much of a miss to anyone doesn't particularly help. I stick it out because of my youngest who is nine.
I left a high paid job last year to go back to something similar I did 6 months prior and at half the salary. Knowing my old employer thinks I am only worth half what they used to pay me doesn't help my self-esteem - although I accept I am in a different role I find the dynamics difficult Mostly just on days like today.

Hey 
I’m not sure whether this will get to anyone or whether there is someone out there that can guide me in some way or another, but this is my first step in acknowledging that although I seem okay to every person around me, I am very lost and sad inside. 
I have a full time job, which I love. I know I love it because I spend most of the day smiling. I feel needed there, i am needed, and it is the happiest part of my day. 
I come home (my family home) and I feel terrible, alone, sad, unwanted. For as long as I can remember, my mum has abused me and my dad whenever she can. She picks on things that I am self conscious and have issues with. She often makes fun of my issues with anxiety. More recently it has been making fun of my relationship with my boyfriend - making me feel like my relationship is worthless. For these reasons, every time I hear her voice it causes me a huge amount of anxiety. When I feel down I retreat to my bedroom. I then can hear her voice coming from upstairs and i am very afraid. If my mum abuses me one day, she may come home the next, and she will give me so much love. It confuses me. I force myself to forget what she has said or yelled at me, and show her love back. As long as I can remember it has been this way. 
this has effected my relationship. whenever I have an issue with my boyfriend (of 5 years) we tend to neglect dealing with it and instead prefer to give each other space for a few days. In these days I often force myself to forget what it is that the issue was about, similar to how my mum has forced me to not think about her bad side. 
I Hear her talking about me right now. 
This has ultimately resulted in me feeling very lost. I could leave home but I am too scared of being alone in another house and what I could do to myself I was alone. I’m scared of what I am capable of. 
I could move in with my boyfriend, but am afraid of if something goes wrong or if we fight, where would I go. Or retreat to. 
I feel like I have no safe space where I feel protected and at peace. 
The hardest part of this is, I don’t want to get better. I feel like I deserve pain 
Any help would be appreciated, please

Hi,
I've been going down hill very quickly recently, I feel like my life is out of control in every way possible, I suffer from depression and have for a long time and more recently accepted that I have BPD, as I never wanted to believe it before. 
I did start talking on a different thread so won't go into lots of details but my most recent development is that I only really had my wife as my support, she's my rock. I don't really have any friends and am in the process of trying to find some. But last night my wife told me we should split up, and then that was that, in one foul swoop I lost the very last thing I was holding onto.
This past fortnight in particular has been rough, I've had 3 different people bail on me when I said I needed them. But as someone reminded me 2 days ago I have a supportive wife and now I've lost her too. I'm not sure what to do any more.
I already felt alone and now I'm more alone than ever. Please help. I'm not ok anymore.
 
Keypi :)

Hi All,
I am 54 & started drinking at 48 following gastric sleeve surgery. Prior to this I raised three beautiful amazing children & did two degrees to get to my most loved job. I grew up with my father being a violent alcoholic so this has shocked me that i have succumbed to it. In the last 6 yrs I have drank alot of wine. I think trying to numb my feelings. I am an overthinker. Now, my husband, rightfully so, has had it with me. He's a very stoic, stubborn, older man. Very old fashioned. He's very critical of me. We've been married 29.5 yrs.

hi, my names violet and I am a normal teenage girl that's going through some shit.
okay, my question is, am I feeling numb? and would this feeling go away?
I have some problems which I will not mention. but this problem occurs frequently. it has been occurring ever since I could remember but as I grew older it became worse. usually, I would get mad or angry when the problem happens or sometimes I would get upset and cry but I had come to a realization that the past year I had bearly felt any emotions. whenever this problem occurs I would lash out and become angry but now I go emotionless. no anger, no happiness, no sadness nor frustration. I don't know what's happening but I feel fine. I've never really noticed but I don't remember the last time I had felt emotion when I was truly happy. and whenever I choose to let go and become happy and start laughing with true happiness it feels weird for me. like it's not right for me to be happy because I know something bad is going to happen next.
 
im noticing im becoming faker by the minute. I always have a smile on my face at school and no one seems to notice its fake. my friends always say that im always happy or they've never seen me cry or become upset so I just softly laugh and walk away.
I don't know what to make of myself anymore. when I see someone look at me a smile automatically falls on my face. but when I look away it sets back to the emotionless face. I feel like the most emotion I mainly feel is anger but even that I feel like im losing. I do cry but, for reasons that i will not say is that I never cry in front of people unles I can't get a grip on my emotions and i break down, but never really happens. I feel like im getting emotional easily and I hate myself for it I know everyone cries but I just feel vulnerable when I do so. 
apparently, I was told that I used to have anger problems and that I would lash out if I was angry. and thankfully I've learned to control that but as I steer my anger away I feel like I lost control of the steer and im losing the only part of myself where I felt something....
now whenever the problem occurs I wait till I feel upset or something but I feel fine and yet im dying on the inside.

Hi, 
This is my first time posting here. I've read a few threads on here before and people seemed to be incredibly helpful so I thought I'd reach out with my current situation.
I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for approximately five years or so now and it's recently gotten a lot worse, mainly increasing before or after a shift at work or in the lead up to work. I am only a casual, though I feel incredibly guilty that I have been taking more sick days than normal as a result of depressive episodes and anxiety attacks and I am aware that a lot of people at my work do think I am frequently just 'throwing a sickie'. Yesterday, I went to a doctor who was lovely and helpful, who booked me in for counselling, and recommended that I take a week off work and that, eventually, I try to find employment elsewhere. At the moment, I'm unsure of whether or not to use the medical certificate he gave me as the store (my workplace) has a huge event this weekend and they're probably going to be a little short staffed without me. On the other hand, I do believe that I need some time off to sort myself out. 
What should I do? Has anybody else been in a similar situation before? 
Thank you.

Hi, 
Ive never posted on somewhere like this but im really looking for anything right now. My life has been good and stable, nothing has really ever gone wrong and im extremely grateful for that. But over the past 18 months, Ive had this emptiness feeling almost just overwhelm every aspect of my life. I belived it was my Job, so I quit and found another, I believed it was my lifestyle so I went out of my comfort zone. I actively tried to change all these major apsects of my life in order to combat it but it seemed to just consume me. In the past 6 months its became quite aggressive I wake up with little to no care about the result of anything or anyone for the day, I still go to work and remain apart of society, but the days of not even wanting to do that are becoming more normal. The want in my life is gone, I dont want anything or anyone. Im only 20 years old, i feel i should be wanting to take on the world. In the past couple months its been heartbreaking to see the enjoyment is used to get from being around family and friends completely dissapear. Life has become really grey and bleak, and it never used to be like this. Nothing has changed drastically in life so i dont know why or expect anyone to understand or believe this is happening. I dont want to feel like a victim and I sometimes feel like the best thing would be for it to be all over, not just for me but for everyone as id rather them remember me for the person I was rather the empty person im becoming. I know i need to talk too someone about this, but I just cant see myself ever doing so. Even if it may be the only way to get better, I feel like the only option i can convince myself is that its best to just let life take its course. I never used to be like this, im really exhausted and upset at the situation, but i know life will go on and im hoping it gets better. Has anyone else felt like this, and managed to find a happiness again? if so im really looking for help
Thanks
Sam

um.... hi? okay im not sure if im doing this right but it's my first time being on this website and I read through a lot of peoples thoughts and problems hoping I would get something out for myself. 
growing up as I child I was literally the shyest girl out there. and although my parents said otherwise I knew I was different. I was at the age of 5, 6, 7 or so, I was very young. im not sure why but I was always thinking I was judged. I used to think everybody felt like me, but as I grew older I realized it was not normal for a 6 or seven years old to feel like there being judged all the time. whenever someone would laugh I would have the urge to cry as I thought it was directed at me. weird but my biggest strugle when i was younger was to call my name out on the roll. i remember waking up and being upset that i had to say a simple 'here' or 'present' infront of the class. whenever somone wispered i used to think it was about me. even if i hear some of there conversations being related to random topics, I always had the fear that they were laughing at me. I could never say no to anyone afraid they might hate me, and as a child, I never really felt like myself in front of others, and I would always beat myself up about it. I used to pray every day that I would gain confidence. my biggest wish was to have a best friend that I can ramble non stop without being judged on what I say. I was so insecure and had no confedence, and that was the biggest thing I bet myself up for. everybody knew me as the quiet girl as I bearly spoke, but thankfully as im older now logic settles in a bit and I had come to a realization that nobody was judging me. i never really took notice until i actually looked back at myself and relised that it wasn't normal but then again im not sure. is it normal for a 6-7 year old to feel so sared of everybody judging her every move? 
oh and note i only remember this started when i was in yr one with a somwhat clear memory and it continued all the way into highschool until 2 years ago when i finally managed to make myself more confident and gain more friends. and although i know there still an a small bit in me were i feel judged but i had taught myself not to car anymore and dismiss others opinions unless there good or adviceful ones.

I’m not sure what I want to achieve here, but I guess with anonymity I can write honestly about what’s happening to me. 
After almost 8 years of battling my worsening mental state, I’ve finally found the courage to tell some of my friends but I’m not ready to tell them the full extent of it because I don’t want them to have to carry this darkness in their lives too. 
I used to feel invincible: in my dream degree (medicine), successful athletically, and capable of talking to anybody about anything, and more importantly willing and able to help anyone I cared about with anything. I can honestly say I was living my best life: a life of ego approaching zero where I gave everything to the people I cared about. 
But after the person I considered my only true friend, and the person I wanted to spend my life with - chose a path of actions that made me experience hurt more than I’ve ever experienced in my life, something in my brain snapped and it’s felt like I’ve been cut off from the ability to use it properly ever since. It wasn’t a gradual creep, it was like a switch. 
I dropped out of medicine to do Commerce, since it was less rigorous and I could attempt to balance my shifting moods with my workload. My whole personality changed, my new insecurities would flare up at any little trigger and my ordinarily sharp memory has deteriorated to the point I can’t hold a conversation or recall recent events. Although somewhat ironically, I constantly wake up at 3am on work nights to nightmares of events that have upset me and am unable to get back to sleep. 
I’ve intermittently sought professional help, tried all sorts of self medicating, meditation etc. but nothing’s helped me so far. 
It think the saddest thing is I have no longer have any will to live. I’d never act on this, I don’t have the strength, and I care too much about my family and friends. But it’s getting harder and harder to keep my life together, and people are more aware of the cracks than ever. It’s just exhausting, and immensely painful to keep going without any drive or passion fueling me.

Random question. 
Im at an age and stage in my life where my husband and I are having the baby talk. 
Im really scared about let alone that I've got PCOS and Endo which will make it harder for me to get pregnant or keep my child. I've had a loss a few years ago. But now with my bipolar I'm so scared. Like really scared. 
I'm scared I'm going to lose it while pregs, I'm scared I'm going to freak out and stress out after having the baby im scared I'm not going to be able to the be best I know I can be. I'm scared I'm going to screw up my child. Im scared if I have a loss or can't conceive I'm going to lose it. 
Has anyone on here with bipolar have a family and been through this journey. If you don't mind letting me know what it's like that would be great pleas

Hi Everyone,
This is my very first post not only on Beyond Blue but on any type of mental health forum. I'm going to try keep this as short as possible so please bear with me. I am asking for any suggestions, tips or even reading materials.
I am a straight 20yo male and have dealt with a lot of anxiety my entire life. I have always been very shy and not so much as an outgoing person. I've particularly dealt with a lot of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) throughout my teenage years although I was never diagnosed with it, it was very clear to me that I was suffering from the disorder. I'm glad to say that it is almost non-existent in my life, however in certain situations I do get a bit edgy.  I have never in my life tried to reach out for help until now and I kind of see it like I should tackle this on my own. I know it's heavily encouraged to seek help with this sort of thing but I really want this to be the first step towards creating a more fulfilling life for myself. Not only that, but the entire world could tell me get assistance and I know I would still struggle to do so. I really don't like talking about it with anyone, even my closest friends. Again, I know it's perfectly fine to but I really want to do this my way.
At this current stage of my life, I am incredibly confused and frustrated with myself. I feel almost desensitized to life's pleasures and I find it difficult to look forward to certain things or gain the motivation to do the things I want to do to benefit myself. I am not sure if I'm suffering from depression but I do get very down on myself quite often. I work and study (online) part time. I hate university, I can't stand it and it's definitely not for me. The only reason I started it was because I felt like I had very little self-worth at the time, and I still do. I like to think of myself as independent and I really enjoy business and would be interested in tackling this by myself. 
I am very very very self conscious about the way I look, from every piece of clothing to the hairs on my head, again this is something I have always dealt with. To be honest it's a mixture of all these things and I'm afraid that if I don't start to work on it (like I should have many years ago) that I would forever be on a downhill roller coaster. 
Furthermore, surprisingly enough I'm not too bad with women, it boosts my confidence quite a bit so I guess I'm not completely in the dark.  
Thank you so much for reading this, any tips would help a lot.

Hi, I’m new & this is my first post. 
Ive recently been struggling with what I think is severe depression. I’m a 38yr old executive and in this last year my career has really taken off and I have spent a lot of time in the work space. I’m also a mum trying to juggle 2 beautiful girls in school and an MBA. So many wonderful things have happened to me in this last 12 months that I can’t complain, but I am struggling with the juggle of being all things to all people. My husband works but definitely puts all his faith in me to be the main provider as he has never been motivated and I always have been - in addition to that he is about to lose his job. It’s an insane amount of pressure and I find myself trying to balance a full time career and not disappoint anyone....and try and do everything well at home where I am always disappointing everyone. For the past 6 weeks I have not been functioning very well. I can’t sleep and I’m up till all hours. I have no desire to do anything. I don’t want to go out.... brushing my hair is a serious effort. I don’t want to see anyone. I feel like I am in a coma and I can’t get out of it. This morning I literally sat in a chair for an hour and just stared at nothing - it’s not like me. I’m a bubbly happy person who is normally trying to make others feel good but I’m tired of always being there for others at the expense of myself.  I’m feeling really scared because I feel so lonely and have no one to talk to. My husband doesn’t seem to understand and for the most part just just seems to ignore me when I seem off. Our sex life has disappeared and my husband felt the need to joke about it with our friends recently which told me that he is not happy. Everything is falling apart and I feel worried that soon my job is also going to fall apart because it is so hard to lead and manage a big team when I feel like crying every minute of the day. There is no room for error or for weakness. I run a charity as well and I feel like I am always doing things for others but no one is ever doing anything to help me. I don’t know what to do.

Hi. I have to go for a pre-employment medical next week which includes a drug test. I'd like to keep the fact I take medication private if possible. Would this show up in the drug test? I'm kind of worried that if I disclose it it may mean I won't get the job but if I don't and it is identified in my sample I'll have to tell the truth and it will come out that I lied. Please help?

Hi guys, my name is Leon and am just graduated from university December last year. I felt so proud and happy from this and so is my family. I feel so alive. From that time, I tried to find a job here in Melbourne, but I can't get any luck with that, mostly because none of them accepts non-citizen or permanent residence. I feel depressed due to this, because I felt like my family really wanted me to be able to succeed here. Am I exaggerate anything? I know I could just go back to my home country and find a job there. But I'm so afraid that I disappoint everyone that have put such high hope to me. I feel like a failure all the time these past few weeks, and I thought that this forum could help me communicate with people out there other than my family, because I am afraid that I will worry my family and friends if I told them how depressed I am. 

I thought about suicide multiple times, however I believe that is not an option and will never be. I hope this forum could help me talk about these problems so I could get back on my feet and keep looking for jobs, hopefully finding one.

Hi everyone, 
I am a person struggling with depression. I have had it for almost a year and lost many close relationships because of it. Ironically, I am in a very serious romantic relationship. It seems even though the relationship is very healthy, I still struggle with trust and my own insecurities -that gets in the way. 
I am afraid of being alone, and I don't want to lose this close relationship that I have, especially since I have lost a lot of close friends. I am not sure if I should maintain it, or if it is healthy to leave the relationship and get better before pursuing another one.

I have untreated (mostly undiagnosed) depression for years but it has never impacted my ability at work. Actually I am so skilled at masking it no one in a work place from my past would actually have the slightest idea.
My current workplace has been bad for my mental health. I have felt myself sinking more and more over the past few months. There has been a lot of focus on me compared to co-workers and I get why there would have been at the start and I also realise that some of the focus these days is more to do with I have somewhat (sometimes) impressed people there with my ability so they are looking and talking about future potential. None the less, the focus on me has lead to changes in me that I don’t like. Doubting my knowledge, doubting my ability which is sending me all over the place. I will add I had quite a bit going on in my life in the last 6 months of last year.
recently I realised just how far I had fallen virtually at the hands of work and all the chatter about me by senior staff. I wasn’t prepared to fall lower (I feel so low already i am not sure if lower is even possible, although logically I know it is) so I actually resigned and am currently in my notice period.
It was a super hard decision as I actually really like the work and the potential to grow in the long term but my low no longer just affects how I feel at work it is impacting every element of my life so it seemed like what I needed to do.
now as I wait out my notice period I keep wondering how much of all of this is the black dog speaking and how much was it what I really needed. I felt low before but now I feel like there is a huge gaping hole in me. Is the hole and doubt about what I did being right actually correct or if it the fear of the unknown - no job, no prospects, no idea how to sell myself felling this way. 
how do you know when quitting is the right solution and when it is just the black dog dragging you through the mud? If it is actually just the black dog, should you even attempt to get your job back? If you should, how do you even tell them about it? Telling them may make things worse as it will get me even more attention and probably more chatter, I just really like my job and hate quitting but my mental health is making it seem impossible.
Thanks

I am currently 30 weeks pregnant and am really happy about it, especially after my first being a loss. 
The only thing is that I have been feeling really lonely and borderline depressed. My husband is a wonderful man but sometimes I don’t think he understands how hard and isolating being pregnant is. There are times where I just want to talk about how I feel but he doesn’t seem to get it or tries to give me advice to ‘fix the problem’. 
I am not one to share my feelings with many people so thought I’d post here to see if anyone else is feeling the same and what you have done to ease this loneliness. 
thank you

There are times when all those low feelings of worthlessness, sadness and despair intensify to the extreme. But then in a few hours I'm back to being calm, numb or amused at the ridiculousness of it all. It's strange, I remember that I did feel hurt at the time but I can't relate to it. It feels like another person's memory. Sometimes I will reject 'that person' because I'm in disbelief and disapproval of how my behaviour at that time.
I wonder if deep down I am truly manipulative, using depression as an excuse for being lazy in life. Because these extreme lows are more likely/frequent when I have a 'challenge' in life any other adult should be able to overcome. But I thought I was doing okay over the last few months so why the sudden breakdown? It seems like I'm kicking up an attention-needy ruckus when convenient. 
Background: I've been excluded from a Uni course. Currently being encouraged by my GP to apply for a withdrawal based on medical grounds to avoid the mark on my academic transcript. I'm not so convinced I deserve to try.

I am experiencing really awful lows so often now and I’ve been on medication for a year and it’s not helping. I went to the gp today to ask for anything else to help fix me and she wouldn’t listen and just upped my dosage again. Honestly I feel like I’ve only got 2 years left to live because the dosage maxes out and every year it gets worse. Does anyone have anything that will cure me? Like naturopathy or scans or something? I just want to get better and it feels like I never will and what’s the point if I’m unhappy all the time and burdening others? Please somebody help me.

Hello,
I think I am stuck in a very bad dissociative episode.
I'm currently studying a master's degree and am feeling like I am drowning but don't want to help myself either. I just want to give up 
My social anxiety at uni is crippling, I obsess over how my performance is in comparison to others, and what they might think of my ability .. I find it so hard to connect with anyone there and find myself avoiding all social situations or situations where I will be with them all as a group.i constantly worry that no one likes me and I feel very withdrawn
I feel like my brain doesn't work the same way as my classmates and sometimes wonder how I even got to this point in my education in the first place.
I don't want to be me anymore. It's just an endless cycle of anxiety then feeling a strange sense of elated , floaty happiness followed by the most devastating depresssion. 
i have a beautiful partner .. the greatest family yet I'm so disconnected from them all.
It just feels so difficult for me to exist right now

Hi a bit about me. Im a 29 year old woman who has been married for 3 years. Due to living with some kidney issues i have always been in and out of uni since i was 18 and i am in my final year of studying nursing. My husband is trying to push me to work full time instead of studying or he punishes me by telling me he wont have kids with me if i leave work and go back to studies. He is a veru unsupportive and rude person who does not care about me pursuing my dreams. Because of him i do full time waitressing because which i hate and every day i come home feeling useless and depressed. I work for a boss who is rude and I end up doing so much unpaid overtime. I really want to return to my studies in nursing and be happy again but i have no support at home and my husband gets mad with me every time i bring the subject up. He earns 120k a yeAr as a lawyer and we can easily live off one income for one year so i dont see the issue here. He has never took my health issues seriously even after i have had multiple surgeries and a kidney transplant he thinks i am exaggerating. Please help

Sorry to make another thread (different forum, but still), I feel like explaining my situation better, and I had another concern. 
I’ve never be diagnosed, or seen some one who helps mental health, as keeping a mask, and pretending everything’s fine is my way of going, and telling me parents would be a struggle, as I can’t tell what their opinions on the whole matter is.

Now, my family are great, and have taught me great values, that saying, I wasn’t a great kid, I wanted to impress kids not worth it, which came up with some terrible influence, and had some interesting situations, I was an awful person to a friend, who’d honestly done nothing wrong, and that went on for years, disregarding her for myself, eventually it was brushed over by some stupid excuse (I was 7? At the time, i should’ve apologised, and in general, I just wished that I wasn’t like that). Of course it came back up, when I was 10, we do this whole big thing, on social stuff and all that, while never directly stating it, I was so guilty, I didn’t want to be alive, I didn’t deserve to be alive, I skipped class a lot, and honestly it just sucked, it really proves just to be nice whenever you can, there aren’t enough good people in this world.
Now that was a while ago, and while friends, we have a terrible relationship, which just shouldn’t go on. She’s gone through a lot more than me, yet she seems to be fine, and me who, for the most part, is fine, has always felt unhappy in the world.
I feel terrible, I don’t want to be here, I don’t deserve to be here, I don’t see how some people get away with doing that without remorse, or guilt. Call me heartless, stupid, I don’t mind, I’m sick of trying to make myself feel better.
So naturally, I’ve been screwed for years, and I don’t even know at this point, there’s a battle in my mind, that I can’t control, and it’s annoying to go on some days. I try to not think of it, but this girl, has been in my class, for 6 years, I can’t avoid it, or her. We aren’t “friends” only through mutals that is. My parents don’t even know, cause no one told them. I don’t have the heart. I think because it was never concluded, my mind won’t let it rest.
I feel so hopeless sometimes, I don’t even have the right to feel this way, I just don’t know. I’m writing this, mainly because I need to sleep tonight, and having it bug me is not the way to go.
If you have any way to help this, please let me know,
Sam

Hi everyone, I have been living life with a mask of happiness for the last 22 years. Know one in my family or friends knows of my inner sadness. Recent events in my life have made me realise I have been living a lie and deceiving all the people I love. For years I knew something was wrong with me, but not sure what. I could see happy people everywhere, and just wanted to be one. So I put on a smile and got on with life. I remember feeling truly happy and I know the catalyst that put me on this path, what I don’t know is how to rid my mind of this horrible feeling. I can feel the mask slipping off and it scares the shit out of me. My daughter often asks me if I’m ok, of course I always say yes I am just tired from work. Thanks for listening . Willson

Hey folks,
I guess I just need a fresh point of view on my situation. It's a bit of a life story kind of thing, but I'll try to keep it short. Thanks for taking the time to read.
I'm a 28 year old man and I've been struggling with depression since my early teens. It was likely triggered by bullying which lead to a stunted social life and trust issues. Not that my experience was anything extraordinary, I think most people deal with bullying in high school.
Additionally, I've always struggled with finding work. I've had a few jobs here and there, but they never paid enough or provided enough hours for me to actually survive, so of course I still live at home.
Naturally, I also don't have any kind of love life and never have. I've tried to date on occasion, but always end up being treated like garbage. To make matters worse I've also never really been interested in sex and trying to pursue a romantic relationship without sex seems impossible. I could be asexual, demisexual or repressed. I don't know (no, I was not abused as a child or raised religious). There's more to it than that. This is by far my most complicated issue.
I've tried therapy. In fact, I've seen multiple different therapists over the years and every time we've eventually hit a wall. Ultimately their diagnosis has been something along the lines of: ""Well, you're intelligent, charismatic and very capable. You've just been a bit unlucky."" and they don't know what to suggest further. I also can't afford therapy at the moment as I'm once again between jobs.
All my friends have moved on with partners and we no longer speak. I try to get out of my comfort zone to expand my social life by taking classes and attending meetups and the like, but it's really hard to connect with people. I know I'm a good conversationalist (even if I have to fake interest in certain things to get the ball rolling), but it feels like I speak a completely different language to everyone else.
I really want to improve my situation and be happy for once in my life, but I feel stuck. My depressive states are getting more frequent and more severe. I feel like I only have the energy to fix one aspect of my life at a time and I don't know if I should be focusing on work/career or social life. It all just seem impossible right now.
Thanks again for reading. I don't have anyone to talk to about this. Maybe it'll help just getting it out.

I feel empty, like there is nothing in life anymore. I go to work at a place i hate with a passion and then go home and sleep all the time.
 Yeah i know i have to talk to a profession or anybody but i over that, enough I don't want to do that and if thats what somebody is going tomtell me to do then this is no help.
 I can't breath anymore, medication not working nothing is working.

I've been going through a very rough time lately and I have no one to talk to.
I have a circle or friends but I'm only really close to two of them. I can't talk to either of them because one has just had a baby and she's dealing with that, and although I'm close with the other girl, we don't see each other very often and she has her own problems to deal with.
 I can't talk to my boyfriend either because he's useless. He's unemployed and has been for quite some time and all he does is sit on his back side playing video games all day and chatting to friends via social media. I've known him for about six years now, he's my best friend and I love him very much but he's of no help at all. If I try talking to him about something that bothers me, he has a meltdown and says that I demand too much of his time and attention and this causes him to be stressed out. He has time for video games and his own friends, but no time for me. Yet I can't bring myself to leave him.
I can't talk to my family because I have next to no relationship with any of them. It's the worst with my mum.
I work full time and I've been in the same industry for eight years, six years of those have been working for my current employer. I've lost my passion for my job and I want a career change, but I'm worried that I'm too old (almost 28) to start something new although I've been trying (but having no luck). I regret not changing my career path sooner.
In the morning I can barely get myself out of bed. I have so much trouble falling asleep at night because there's so much on my mind, and in the morning I can barely get myself out of bed. Simple things like keeping my room tidy I can't even do anymore, I can barely manage to brush my teeth in the morning. I haven't been eating properly for about two weeks now. I've lost my appetite and I mostly live off water. I even neglect going to the doctor when I'm sick or in pain for whatever reason.
I feel pathetic and useless, and I've all but lost my will to live. My life wasn't always like this, there was a time when I was actually happy. I don't know how it came to this. I just don't know what to do anymore.
Sorry if this post is all over the place, I just don't know where to begin and what to include or leave out.
Thanks for reading.

I haven’t felt truly happy for a very long time and most nights I end up crying myself to sleep for no particular reason. For a while I have felt that there was something wrong but I have never been able to put my finger on it. I don’t really have any real friends anymore because we have all grown apart and so i don’t really have anyone to talk to about my emotions so i kind of just keep everything to myself which apparently isn’t a good thing. I am really scared that i have depression. Does this sound like depression? Or can anyone relate or have any advice?

Hi everyone, this is the first time I am posting (or speaking about it) and am just wondering if anyone has been through as similar situation and is able to give me some tips or advice. 
Heres some background info, back in February last year I injured myself at work and am currently going through a workers comp claim for the injury, from feb to july I was allowed to work modified duties and still earn a wage to support myself but in July last year my employers insurance company denied the claim and within a couple hours I got  call saying i could no longer worker and would have to repeatedly call in sick or if i wanted to work sign a document saying they had no liability and that I was 100% fit for all duties (which I wasn't and still arnt). Because I wasn't able to work I was forced to move back in with my parents, after the claim was denied I got lawyers involved to dispute the liability but have since been 'bullied' as everything the insurance company has done takes a minimum of a month and everything is being dragged along, this caused my anxiety to worsen and made me fall into and out of depression, which caused my uni studies to suffer and made my issues get worse. 
The main question I have is has anyone else experienced something similar and whether or not I should inform my lawyers and add it to the claim or where to go from here, im just really not sure what to do. 
Thank you in advance to anyone that is able to help.

I don't really know why i'm writing but i can't seem to get over depression its been like this for so long i'm tired of it. I feel horrible i spent my holidays doing nothing and just watching tv. I've been so lazy nothing seems to help. I saw my psychiatrist the other day expecting it would make me feel better but it didn't help. I really want to have kids but i can't with the medication and i want to be healthy i feel like i'm going to get to old before i get over this depression or that i will never get over the depression. I don't know what to try next the dr says exercise but i can't seem to make myself do it. I don't understand how i'm meant to get better. What do I do next?

Hi all, I'm new here.
I was just trying to find some help on non-verbalism for people with depression, but I couldn't find much information on it. This isn't really surprising, because non-verbalism is generally linked to ASD rather than MDD. 
But I've noticed when I have my depressive episodes, I actually stop having the ability to talk. I try to get any words out but I just can't. I become mute for days on end, weeks sometimes, during my depressive periods. This makes it incredibly difficult to express how I'm feeling to my parents and other people that are trying to support me. I can't communicate what I need or how they can help. It's extremely frustrating. 
Has anyone here experienced anything similar? Any tips on how to overcome it?

Hi there,
i broke up with my gf about a month ago, everything was ok but recently she told me she hated me and I am the worst person on the planet because I had female friends. 
She continued to hate me and say how bad I was, I did my best to respond with kindness and love however today I lost control and I said something truly awful and brought up a traumatic moment from her past. I felt so awful after it and I can’t see myself the same. She then sent me a text saying I deserve a lifetime of pain and misery and hopes I rot in hell. 
Do I really deserve that? Was my mistake so bad that I deserve pain for the rest of my life? I wish I could take it back and I hate myself so much. I feel like a monster, I never meant to hurt her but I did. 
I feel like I deserve a lifetime of suffering and even worse.

I am a long time viewer but first time poster. I guess I am feeling lost and am hoping opening up on here might help a bit. 
i am 30 years old, male and living with hiv (undetectable and healthy as can be given the circumstance). 
i find myself very lost and lacking purpose in my life. I recently relocated home after moving interstate a few years ago, I needed a change as I felt trapped and found that I was more lonely interstate than when I left - struggling to make friends or connections and being in a environment that was too stressful to cope with. 
i moved back so that I could save money and reset but often found myself here questioning my mental health. My family has a history of bi polar, depression and anxiety and I have definitely felt traits of these in my life - but they come and go. 
I do know I need to see a professional and get help but I am worried it’s all in my head and I will just find myself on more medication on top of antiviral medication. I am hesitant as it does not seem to help my loved ones and instead I see a decline in their overall health as they struggle with day to day basics. 
is this what it is? Is that what will happen to me? Is it beneficial to keep avoiding professional help because I lack the financial availability to do so comfortably? I always seem to feel trapped and that my life has no purpose. Most people are/have been married with children and I really have very little to show for myself other than a life of trying to be independent since mid teens. 
I do want to travel and see the world, but I see this as another hurdle financially and another ‘sign’ that what I want is always too far out of reach, 
I’ve never considered suicide or anything like that but I sure as hell feel low and very mundane. I hate not having a motivation for many things or a confidence to do the things that most people seem to be able to do. 
Apologies if this is posted in the wrong area - I just thought I’d write it all down and go for it as I feel there’s very few who can relate.- or atleast in my life it feels like everyone else is too busy with their own problems to have the the time for me in return. I hide it quite a lot as I am your classic cheerful person on the outside. 
Anyway, appreciate any advice that can be directed my way,

Hi everyone, I need advice on how to cope recovering from a breakdown, because of my anxiety and depression I didn’t leave the house for 7 months and now I’m recovering but I’ve moved to a new state. While I’m coping better than I was, I can leave the house etc but in the process of the breakdown I lost my car and what feels like my life with my job etc. I feel so incredibly lost that I’m not sure how to even start my life again, has anyone else been in the same position? How am I supposed to go back to work again or do anything? I’m so bored without a job but I feel like that’s such a huge step again. I feel like I’ve lost my purpose and my person and no one in my life understands this hopeful feeling. I just don’t know where to go for advice

Is there anyone else out there experiencing all three of these conditions at once as I am?
So many gifts, so much difficulty to manage...
Specifically tips on waking up the nervous system would be most appreciated right now.
Currently on a morning workout, cold shower, amphetamine, strong coffee, and still struggling to feel a pulse ?
How to pressurise the mind without creating actual risk to create the adrenaline required to stimulate frontal lobes?
Mind wandering into creative imaginary scenarios when trying to read, even if I really need to read the thing. Doesnt occur with talented writers who know how to maintain emotional engagement. EG I read 688 pages of Tony Robbins Money in 2 days. Tips on maintaining engagement ?
Challenges with all symptoms associated with diminished frontal lobe capacity, emotional regulation, forward planning, decision making, social interaction, although these functions are superior to most others when emotionally stimulated. Essentially existing with an addiction to anything causing the release of dopamine like a crack addict, just to function. Not to complain, this is just the reality. Does anyone have any strategies for management ?
Thanks.

I have recently posted about my possible new diagnosis of Bipolar.  But wanted to put the noise sensitivity in the heading.  For as long as I have known listening to people eating or any mouth noises has driven me insane, but in the last 10 years that has blown out to just about any sound.  It gets to a point where I get so angry when a noise frustrates me I will completely ""lose it"" .  Along with that now is movement.  For example my children sitting next to me on the couch and swinging their legs.  Its just becoming unbearable and im hoping in some way it may be connected as with new medications maybe there is a way out of this

Hi.  I'm not looking for advice, as I know most of it.  Just need to share.  36 years of depression.  Treatment resistant a lot of the time.  Lucky to have a handful of good supports.  Really tired of life but not going to suicide.  Committed myself to not doing that years' ago as as I have a responsibility to my Mum, my dogs, my partner.  Just getting through.  Will I have ECT again?  Don't know.   Maybe.  Just getting through.  Is there anyone out there who is in a similar situation?  I'm lucky in many ways, supportive partner, financially secure, live in a country like Australia.  But nothing shakes the depression. A swim might lift it by a notch but the next day it's back to where it was.  Meds are starting to kick in.  Sleep gives some relief.  Thanks for listening.  I just needed to tell someone.

Hello  I think i need some help but im not really sure. Lately I have been having some really overwhelming thoughts especially in regards to eating. Im having some troubles trying to explain whats happening and im feel quite emotional and a little embarrassed so please forgive me if this post doesnt make much sense. 
 
Over the past few months i have been having some troubles with food in general and i dont think its normal. I have noticed that when im feeling low or really stressed i will binge eat alot, sometimes to the point that i feel quite sick from overeating. I feel really guilty when it happens as well. The other part is that anytime i eat or drink now even if its healthy i feel really guilty over it, like i dont really deserve it and that others need it much more than i do but i just cant seem to stop :( . I find myself worrying about everyone else too though not just me, im constantly obsessing if others (more so my close family member)  have eaten and checking in on them  and if they havent  i can feel so much panic and i go into some sort of 'fix it' mode where i start cooking things they might like or going to the shops and buying things and even delivering it to their house and making sure they have eaten either before i do or at the same time as me and that seems to be the only thing that stops the anxiety. 
This feels really complicated and messy  :( but if anyone could help i would really appreciate it.

Hello,
First time posting here, so I'll apologize now for any mistakes I make.
I'm in a really strange place mentally right now and I'm not 100% sure on how to describe it, but I'll give it a shot. My life has been a up hill battle from getting out of a very toxic household to getting sacked for reasons that are always changing. I've managed to get into Uni (after almost failing the entry test), however every fail hits me really hard to the point where I've felt like giving up many times, kept pushing on. Today on the other hand, after learning I failed an assignment... I'm just staring at the screen. Any activities that usually evoke some sort of emotion out of me just don't, there's just... nothing. I keep trying to tell myself that I can't let this get me down, especially after everything else I've been through. While writing this it seems my emotions have decided to pay a visit, in the form of I just want to cry and scream, while another part of me says doing such things are a sign of weakness and I need to suck it up. A result of my childhood I'm guessing. The latter one always wins, I don't cry often and it's probably hurting me more than I'd like to admit. I always had to be the ""strong one"" such as when my parents were fighting, even breaking up some fights while my siblings cried in the background, or when people passed away. I always had to function ""normally"" while everyone else was beside themselves, otherwise things wouldn't get done.
This post is a big mess. I do see a counselor, and that does help, I'm also on medication (which I won't say too much on based on community guidelines) which helps as well, but when something bad hits I get knocked off my feet and it's a horrible feeling. I guess what I'm after more than anything by putting this on here is somewhere to get it all off my chest without being judged (I struggle to keep friends because of my past) and hear about coping strategies people use.
Regards,
Username(insertnumbers)

Hi, I am feeling down and I am looking for some perspective.
I have been trying to complete a PhD thesis for 6 years now and it is still not done. I have taken 1.5 years in medical leave due to anxiety and depression at various points. The breaks help initially, but afterwards, the thesis is still there and so are my mental health problems. I am completely disinterested in my topic and I find the work to be very intellectually challenging, so working on it is exhausting as a result. I spend most of my time distracted or actively procrastinating. However, I am determined to finish it so that I won't have wasted 6 years of my life, and because it is ""nearly done"". People keep asking me how much longer it'll take and I honestly don't know. I keep making up deadlines, then half a year blows by and I am still not done. I am pessimistic about ever managing to complete it. It's like I'm waiting for the uni to kick me out so I can evade the blame for my failure. 
I work from home and don't ""get out much"". I moved away from working at the university because I was too anxious to work around people. However, now I am very isolated and out of touch with reality. Whenever I do talk to people I feel like an energy/happiness suck. I don't have anything good to say. Days and nights are blending together. I feel like my life is passing me by... 
I have no income since my scholarship is up. I am living on my partners salary. This is lucky for me but very emotionally taxing. We are struggling with a large weight of credit card debts, personal loans and student loans. I need to finish my degree so that I can contribute to paying our debts. 
If I could, I'd like to be a competitive athlete. I've been competing in a sport at a high level over the course of my studies. However, I am 31 years old... well past the age of people competing in my sport professionally. I feel like I've missed out and all it will ever be is a hobby...
Overall, I am very fortunate and my ""problems"" seem silly objectively. I feel selfish for posting this here. But I do think I need help. Any suggestions for me? I try to be kind to myself, eat moderately healthy, practice yoga, meditate (Headspace app), exercise, and have previously seen psychologists, psychiatrists and uni counsellors. I have also taken a few antidepressant drugs. None of them improved anything. Anyways, all of these things just seem like procrastination from my thesis. I'm so pessimistic about ever being happy again.

Hey, sorry I'm not sure if anyone will read this but I've been struggling in silence for a few years and now it's suffocating. 
I've been slowly dealing with what life throws at me and trying to get by, however I just hit an all time low this week. It was my birthday Tuesday and I was alone (family lives away, no friends) so to fill that void I spent a significant amount of money and I can't return the most expensive product (I bought a second ps4, I don't even know why? I don't need it and I don't usually spend money so recklessly?) so my 22nd birthday was spent alone and crying the whole day. I've continued crying since then with feeling such immense regret/shame that I feel nauseous.
My sleeping is a disaster, I've been desperately trying to fix it but the only way I can be awake during the day is doing all-nighters so the past few days I've been awake for 20+ hours with 1-7 hours sleep in between, I feel awful mentally and physically. I've bought this up with different doctors and psychologists over the years to which they say to that I need to be more strict with my alarm, but I simply cannot fall asleep during the night (and my body wakes itself up during the night even if I'm exhausted), I've tried the every bit of advice to fall asleep but I just toss and turn for hours. When I let my body sleep when it wants without forcing an all-nighter I naturally fall asleep around 7am, which is not great when looking for a 9-5 job.
That being said, I'm unemployed. Only had one job at 16 then been unemployed ever since, I honestly feel like I don't have a chance because I don't know how to socialize with people and I freeze/burst into tears so frequently. Still don't even have a driver's license and unsure if I ever can since I panic so often.
Overall, I feel like a waste of space with nothing to contribute to society and at this point, it seems I'm too much of a burden that I don't deserve any friends even if I were to find anyone who could tolerate my existence. I've been diagnosed with depression at 14 and anxiety at 17, while I have made big improvements over the years, ever since this year I've relapsed real hard and can't pick myself back up.
Really sorry for the huge wall of text. I've been feeling physically sick from regret for three days straight and it's really taking a toll on my mental health, I don't know what to do. Thank you and sorry again if anyone had the patience to read all that...

Hi all, I have just joined the community today have been feeling drained for quite a few months now. Have had daily thoughts about ending it but these have gone away when I think about my family and girlfriend. Being unemployed for a couple of months now has not helped and my interest in hobbies that I used to enjoy has diminished. I get angry and frustrated more often about my current life situation still living with parents, no career prospects, relationship troubles. I broke down before it's just a very tiring situation and I don't have any interest in doing anything anymore I want it to be over.

You know the game well. You all start at the bottom and up you go as the dice rolls. Then just as you think you are ahead, down you slide, everyone laughs but you, hiding your disappointment behind your smile.
 
The thing with a game like that, the winner is the result of pure luck and nothing more. The luck of the dice. There is no real magic ability lurking within us. The Prime Minister or a mathematician would have no more luck than you. So while it is a game, it, like depression, can strike anyone at any time regardless of who you are, how clever you are or how stable you think you are.
 
Take Mr and Mrs average. This modern world of Dad, mum and two kids for example. More often than not both parents work. Lets look at the cash strapped modern family. They experience the never ending ‘snakes’ that they slide down every week. They live on the brink, it could be because of poor financial management, too many expensive purchases etc. All the while their game is more a gamble, for if one of the parents fall ill outside of work as they cant afford income protection insurance (not many can) they drop to one income. Result stress on top of a stressful situation. Even if a workplace accident income drops to 60%.
 
For the family above, they need to find, somehow, more ladders than snakes. Some find it by way of inheritance, others a third job, and some downsize with their home. Some don’t make it. Bankruptcy in 2014-2015 were over 17,000. Some were companies, companies or individuals this is staggering. Imagine the number of families effected by this financial doom? Imagine the number of people struck down with depression during that process of seeing their life as a failure, losing their homes or cars, the humiliation. Little things to some of us like rolling up at a friend’s BBQ driving an old car – “what happened to your lovely Land Cruiser Bill”? ""umm, just sold it""
 
The important message here that I want to convey is that bankruptcy is temporary, one day it will end and you are able to seek a limited amount of finance to secure essential items for your basic survival until it does terminate. The numbers show, it is very common. It doesn’t mean its your fault. The roll of the dice remember!
 
Basic financial stress is best to be dealt with by a qualified financial advisor. And as soon as you feel depressed, visit your GP for a talk. 
Suspect a friend has money issues? Reach out and chat. Tell them its doesn't last forever. Comfort them.

Hi everyone,
In April 2018 I was diagnosed with Major depression, Social anxiety and an adjustment disorder. No one in my family ever spoke about mental health so I never really thought about it before all this happened and now I just feel broken, pathetic and weak.

I’m having a tough time at the moment, the past 10 months have been the hardest time in my life it’s full of ups and downs and I think I’m just about ready to crack.  Just trying to get out of bed each day and find the enthusiasm to do anything anymore is so difficult.
I've been on line a lot reading about how people have been in the same situation and what they have done to help them and I just don’t understand these people.
Speaking to friends, doing exercise, eating healthy, talking to a psychiatrist.
But I don’t understand how people can just do any of that! I have no energy to exercise, I don’t trust anyone to talk to them and I don’t have the energy to do groceries so when I can be bothered to eat then it’s gonna be junk food.
Im always tired and all I think about at work is getting home and crawling back into bed, I used to put so much passion into my work and really make changes now I couldn’t care less. The only reason I turn up and do the bare minimum is because if I lose this job I also lose my house, and access to health professionals.
I am a burden on those I work with and I hate that it’s come to this but I really just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t think this job is for me but if I leave I lose everything.
I was taken off antidepressants and sleeping tablets in October 2018 because apparently I’m doing well but nothing has changed, even on the medication I didn’t feel any better. I feel like the Dr’s just don’t want to deal with me.
I know things have to change, I just can’t do it and it makes me feel even worse, I wish I could wake up one day being totally happy with everything and not have a care in the world but thats never going to happen.
I don’t even know why I’m typing this, it’s not like I have a question I guess I just wanted to share my story with people that would listen and hopefully not judge me.
I guess any words of wisdom or advice would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.
Regards,
Random name.

Hello All
First off...thanks for reading my post.  I am new to this site and not sure how to go really...therefore I will try to keep it small!
My diagnosis is major depression and 'aspects' of BPD .  I also have issues with alcohol.  I understand how I have come to this point and I won't go into it here.  I am just looking for friends to talk to.  Most people I know would have absolutely no idea about me...I put on a brave face and everyone either thinks I am ok or basically they don't care (which is fine as I don't truly care about others either!  UNLESS they are suffering..then I will do my utmost to help).  That may sound mean...it is not meant to.  Just that I am surrounded by wealthy, successful and happy people who really would not understand me if they only knew.
I am so over it...the meds (that I do not think help)...the struggle daily...I have a 'boyfriend' who I believe is making me worse!  He is unemployed, uneducated, unmotivated....you get the gist.  I guess I am just wondering if there is anyone out there feeling the same and what you do to deal with it.  I absolutely adore dogs so I go to the dog beach/park every day for my 'furapy'!  I am currently unemployed and hating my boring life and sitting around thinking rubbish all day/all night....sorry if this is a bit convoluted.
Thanks for reading.

I have previously commented on another thread but basically ive suffered from anxiety and depression wince i was a teenager and i now 34. i have had to start coming off a lot of my medications as they arent safe to take while pregnant and im trying to have a child with my partner through ivf. coming off these mood stabilisers and others meds are making me very anxious and depressed. sometimes i wander if it just too much but i either need to go through this for the baby we both want or i go back on my meds and theres no baby. im just so upset i cant handle feeling like this. im so fatigued and i just want to sleep the days away and im often neauseas. ive talked to my family doctor and he just said its not an easy journey and i need to weigh up whats more important to me. i just dont know what what to do :'(

I'm 21-years old and literally am the biggest loser. I have almost no friends, outside of people who i work with (So i'm forced to be with them as its work time), i literally never hang out with anyone. I was okay in school, had friends here and there and got a long well with most people, never ever had fights or anything, i got along well. Ever since school finished, my life has gone down hill... I work almost all the time, i do have a good job and study at uni... but i literally have no life. This started from literally the moment i finished school, i hardly had the time to hang out with people and only had so few friends that eventually its all faded away. The People who i thought i was close with, i almost never see. I do have 1 friend i've always been close with... just 1, however tonight really killed me inside with this person. Me and my close friend were at 21st tonight from an old school friend, and I literally left after 2 hours, coz i had no one to talk to. I just sat in a corner, which has been the case for the last couple parties i've been to. My close mate i was with, totally brushed me and spoke to all the old friends i had (people i was very close with in school), and no one really seemed to care and or even add me in conversations. I had to walk out and go home, had never felt like more a loser in my life. I had good relationships with people when i was around 17/18, hence why i was given an invite to their 21sts. However, all i am, is a simple 'hello, how are you going?"" type guys to everyone, and then they walk away, and i realise how little friends i have. 
I'm really hating my life. I work too much, I've always been working nights when people are out. when i had just finished school and was 18/19, i barely got to hang out with friends, because i was working and i feel it's one reason why this has all gone to shit. I get along with people well, the people i work with all like me, and we work well together. But that doesn't matter, because all i do is work and just lay at home bored when i'm not at worki, wishing i had friends to hang out with. Two other really close friends i had, i saw maybe 3 times in the previous year, guys who i considered my best friends. I doubt i will even see them this year, they have girlfriends and are busy with their own life etc. I literally have no one to spend time with, people from school who were my friends, other people who i had friendships for a long time, are now all gone.

I find it increasingly difficult to vocalise my depression; this lack of capacity to vocalise then releases as anger, and often this anger takes the form of yelling at those who only wish to help. 

Any advice on how to vocalise depression/anger concerns/issues? 
More problems are being caused as a result.

I graduated 2 years ago and Im in uni. Last year I took a gap year because I was crying every night and I found it really hard to commit to the study load however I didn't really think much about it because uni is hard! In the past year, I have spent my time with my boyfriend of 2 years, however I cry a lot. This might be TMI and remove if it is, but after we sleep together I normally end up crying, and whenever we're on a phone call it usually ends with me crying (he isn't abusive). Another instance is with my family. I am the youngest and I have ALWAYS been spoken to as a child and ignored despite being an adult. Whenever I try to talk to my mum about something serious e.g. being sad or having problems she just shrugs it off and leaves which in turn makes me feel neglected and unloved. This, again, leaves me crying because I feel a sense of uselessness and like I'm not good enough. I often turn to alcohol to make me forget about it which isn't a good coping mechanism but it works. I also often cancel plans on people because I don't feel up to going out because I feel like if I do I will ruin the mood and be upset the whole time. 
So my question, am I depressed or just sad? I don't know if it is normal to cry this much, and I'm not sure if it's just who I am as a person? My mum has depression and has been for the past 5 years and relies on her medication. I'm scared of seeing someone, being diagnosed and then relying on something to make me happy :/

Hi guys,
I've struggled with my mental health for quite some time and it wasn't until the last hospitalization in (Aug18 for 6weeks) that i was diagnosed with Bipolar. In many ways the diagnoses made sense, however i never asked for this. :( I don't think its quite sunken in just yet.
All i see myself doing is having to take my medication each night going to sleep waking up going to work and repeat. The meds just slow down everything im not as productive as i use to be. the meds null the activity in my head and allow me to get some sleep. with mood stab in the mix. 
I guess i miss the old me me, wanting to run wild and i feel as if i'm losing many people around me as i feel i am not the same person i was.
As much as things are a little more ""balanced"" in the doctors eyes in some odd obscure way, i find that i find myself more and more isolated in my head than ever. Also find that i'm more of an internalize r now as i do not want to say the wrong thing to someone and worry anyone around me as i have lost a couple of ""good friends"" with the last episode back in Aug.
I wanted to see if any others had these feelings, and what did they do to try and find ""legit Balance"" in the head whilst on these BP meds.
Cheers

I am a 29 years old male, single,
turning 30 this year and I still live with my parents. I have a full time job. Been
working at that job for 4+ years (I’m an office clerk), but I don’t make enough
to be able to afford rent. I’ve recently completed a Certificate III in IT from TAFE, and
I’m in the process of trying to find a better job in IT. I’ve been trying to
find a new job in IT for the last 6 months but haven’t had any success, due to
a lack of experience in the IT field. 
Seriously, it’s infuriating and embarrassing for me.
My parents keep telling me that
its OK for me to stay at home with them, and as far as I know they don’t seem
very interested in helping me become more self-sufficient, so I’ve been taking
steps to achieve my goal of being self-sufficient by myself (by learning to cook my own
meals, manage my own finances etc.) but my mother keeps cooking food for me
even though I tell her that I would like to try and learn to cook by myself. Don’t
get me wrong I love my parents and I’m not blaming them for my predicament, but
they seem to have a “helicopter parents” vibe to them.
I almost feel like running away
to a Homeless Shelter or something just to leave my parents’
house. What’s your advice?

Hi there. I'm very confused with my depression. I am 100% sure it's depression and not just sadness I'm dealing with as I've had it on and off for years, but I don't understand why it just comes on so randomly and only for a few days to a week, then it goes away. Like a virus, I get sick then get better, then it might happen again in like a month or 2. I don't get mania so it's not bipolar. I've started on medication again as I was incredibly bad for the last few days, but before I can even give it a chance to kick it, I'm better again. I don't think it has much to do with happy and bad things happening in my life, it seems so random but either way it's very strong when I get it. I don't want to face the day, I don't want to have a day, I keep telling myself to just get through it as I always get better but it's so hard at the time. It feels like I'll never get better and at the time I'm always convinced I'll be like this forever. It's not until I come out of it that I can think clearly again. I nearly quit my job last time it happened, because I didn't think I'd come out of it but I feel like I am getting better now even though I've only been taking my medication for 3 days.
 
I'm not sure if I get anxiety, I feel like saying I worry is more accurate. I get obsessed with thoughts and play them out in my head to the point where I feel like they are real and I'll be at work convinced something bad I've thought of is happening and be trying with everything I have not to cry and concentrate on my work which I normally can't.
 
I also feel constantly frustrated and irritable. I don't feel like this is me. I feel like I'm naturally patient so I don't understand the short fuse. Ive been like this for the past few years.
 
I don't really know what I'm asking, I just don't know how to get better. My work is suffering and I've been through 3 jobs in the last year because of it. My relationship is suffering and I don't know how to explain to my partner what's happening because I get frustrated that he doesn't get it. He does try, but I just expect alot of him because I feel like I need someone to help me get better and he's not a miracle worker.
 
Anyway, can someone relate or suggest any ways to get better?

I’m from the U.K. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I have been feeling so down over the last few months. If I’m down in the most beautiful place on earth, then what hope do I have?! I was travelling with a group of guys I met up the east coast from sydney and we stopped in Brisbane to do work and then carry on after. I soon realised that the group dynamic changed and that cliques began forming in our duration in Brisbane. I started to begin to feel like the group did not like me or have time for me. I was living alone for my duration in Brisbane as my job was very far out the city. Anyway, I started developing panic attacks where my arms felt tingly at night, I was going into a downward spiral. I’ve not voluntarily listened to music in months, and I’ve not been eating right. I opted out doing the rest of the east coast because I no longer felt comfortable, instead I opted to travel alone. I’ve had bad news about family back home, and the bank has told me that my credit card is overdue, everything is just happening at once. I feel like there’s only so much positivity I can have. I literally have no interest in anything and enjoy drinking to compensate. My dream has always been Australia. I have no chance of travelling the east coast as I messed up. I am exhausted from travelling and backpacking life, I feel like I should go home, but I know il hate being back.  I’ve never felt like this before, and wondering what the hell is going on. I appreciate anyone’s advice.
Thanks

Hi all,
Last week i hit rock bottom. It was the lowest i have ever felt in my life. It was due to a mixture of things piling up in my life and i finally crumbled under the pile. After a complete meltdown and the helpful words of many beautiful people on beyond blue i started to see a light in the dark fog that clouded my life. This past week that light has been shining brighter as i am trying so hard to remain positive about myself and others. However tonight people who are family friends decided to throw some drama my way. I have tried to remain positive and to keep my thoughts happy but in this situation it has proven difficult to do so. These people are the type of people who thrive on drama and love playing the victim card. I just wish they would leave me out of it. They have no idea that i have depression because quiet frankly they haven't asked nor do I think they care. I just wish people could just be nice to others. I wish people could just understand that everyone is going through something in their lives and just because a person doesnt tell you what is happening in their lives doesnt mean they aren't going through a hard time. I wish I was a person who is not fazed by anyone's actions or words. It just feels like it's a constant struggle to keep myself in a happy state and it really shouldn't be this way.
Sorry for rambling on but i feel as if this is my only avenue of expressing how i feel without being judged. 
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Hi all 
I posted sometimes last year when I was in a really bad way, although my threads have disappeared, archived maybe. 
It helped and I thank those who supported me. My family especially has stuck by me although I have been very toxic to be around and I need to reconcile with them.
I'm far from well but a lot better than what I was. I came off meds in July.  I found they fogged me up. I'm not in therapy anymore. The shrinks thought I was well enough to carry on. I tend to agree but there is a lot of wreckage.
The problem I'm encountering is massive procrastination and rumination. I've basically been sitting tight for more than a year.
 That was necessary to begin with, when my anxiety levels were off the chart and I was at risk. But those have subsided to a point where I don't have physical symptoms. 
I've got comfortable sitting tight, kind of accept my situation but really need to get back on my feet.
Any advice on how to do this? I mean from people who have been there. I know I can find stuff online about this.
I have a backlog of stuff to do which sometimes seems overwhelming, so I don't do it. I fear a relapse but we're moving house so I have to get moving, literally.
Does this make any sense? What is the next step please?

I've been suffering from depression for i think a year and a half. The peak happened at the beginning of this year but I'm gradually getting better. I even think I'm almost healed up now from depression. However, I started looking through at my old messages with some of my close friends and I can tell how my I have changed. I used to be so carefree and joke about everything, and was very close with my best friends. Now I really struggle with showing affection to my close friends. It's like I'm trying to control my emotions all the time. I just want to get back to that old self. She was secure about her friendship and have no problems saying I love you to her friends. The me now feel anxiety from messaging people I care about holiday greetings or birthday greetings. It's like I don't even deserve to greet them. It's like the only time I'm myself is when I'm drinking alcohol. I don't want to be addicted, but its only when I had alcohol I have the confidence to be honest to everyone. I just really want to be my old self back. The self that I used to love.

I work a very demanding job, and I have spent the last few months counting down the days until my annual leave. I was feeling exhausted and I wanted to have a ""stay-cation"" at home, complete gardening projects and relax. It has been far from relaxing. I work a demanding job, but it is no-where near as demanding as spending time alone with this brain. I am staving off depression, again, for the umpteenth time. A big part of this has been reflecting on the 'celebratory' period, Christmas, etc. Christmas is supposed to be about connection, and I came face to face with how disconnected I feel. The truth is, many of my relationships are points of escape from being alone. Particularly my romantic relationship, which is often times abusive (I am on the recieving end). But the vile things he says about me are nothing compared to the vile things I say about myself. Although, I have spent the last 6 months dedicating one- two days a week to therapy, I never mention it to anyone. I don't talk about the medication I am on and how it is making me sweat waterfalls in the summer. This mental illess is a big chunk of myself, my personal history, my hopes for the future and it is just absent from my relationships for the most part, because nobody likes a Borderline. We are supposed to be evil, crazy, manipulative, selfish, self-destructive, moody, annoying. I try to suppress the Borderline so much in my relationships, and I would never, ever share the diagnosis, ever. I haven't even shared it with one of my primary doctors. Anyway, so there are multiple parts to this:- I am afraid to be alone. But, not being alone is playing along with a farce, and also tolerating abuse. So, I did not feel the ""spirit of Christmas"". I felt more alone than ever, because it's getting harder to tell myself that my friends & partner know me and love me, and that these relationships are meaningful and fulfilling. I tell myself these sweet little stories all the time, but they are not the full picture- just like I am not the full picture to most people around me. But, the truth is, I have this illness, and I have a trauma history of sexual abuse. And every day is a battle. I just wanted another human being to hear the truth for once.

Hello, I am new to this forum and really don't know where to start, but I'll try my best

For my whole life, I have been raised in a very very religious household. I don't want to get into too much detail, as it is a very broad topic in my life, but I have never really made any friends because my family doesn't really like me talking to people outside of the religion. I feel as if this has become a major issue as of recent, because I feel like I have absolutely no one who really cares about me, and a family who will limit contact with me once I come out as gay and leave the religion. All of this has accumulated throughout my early-mid teen years, in which I was very anxious and depressed 24/7, leading me to become extremely underweight to this day, and having no positive image of myself. 
Now, I am still no better than I was back then, nothing much has changed, I still struggle to get out of bed in the morning and talk to anyone, because I've been taught from a young age that all people will do is bring pain to me, so its better not to talk to them. I don't have many friends, and most of them tend to ignore me and get angry when I try to talk to them about anything, telling me to bother someone else because I'm too needy (their words). The one close friend I have, who I don't deserve, is the only one I really talk to anymore, and even then, I struggle with the negative thoughts about how ""he doesn't really wanna talk to you"" and ""he is talking to you because he feels bad"".
I feel like I haven't really felt anything for a long while now, the only productive thing I can do anymore is draw, and am worried that I will continue to get worse as time goes on. My medicine and therapy haven't done much to help me, and I worry if I'm a lost cause.
I have no idea on how to cope with this, but I hope that made sense, Thank you for reading.

Hello. You can call me Blue. Just as the title says, I feel hopeless and stuck in a rut. I have a strong desire to become happy, content, and dignified, but it just doesn't happen to me, almost ever. First and foremost, I apologize in advance if my english/grammar is excruciatingly difficult to understand. I am both Asian and mentally ill, so please bear with me.

My problems started in primary school, where I was badly mistreated by my peers. My mom and dad were very gentle and loving people, hence, I was well taken care of and very sheltered. Because of this, I grew up to become a principled but, very emotionally sensitive child. This made me a target for bullies, who took advantage of my pacifism, meekness, and sensitivity. The experiences I had were like that of a bullying scene in a movie, sometimes worse. Verbal abuse was much more painful than physical ones. I was often called names, pushed into the urinal, physically beaten, shoes and lunch money robbed etc. But what hurt me the most was the public humiliation. While most people consider their high school graduation as one of the happiest moments in their lives, I consider mine the worst. A graduation hymn was sung towards the end of our graduation ceremony. Imagine being around 500 students singing, distorting the lyrics with such disgraceful words that target only you. I was crushed. I was really crushed. I never recovered from that, and it gives me nightmares to this day.

Having little self esteem and confidence, I grew up to become an escapist, trapped in my room playing video games, listening to music and playing the guitar. Later on, I started to became pretentious, delusional and conceited. I joined a band, tried to act cool, look cool, and occasionally bully weaker blokes. My academics suffered and I barely completed high school and uni. Because of that I dumbed down, and always have difficulty succeeding with work or study. Nothing has changed up to this day. Because of my shortcomings, everything in my life is suffering… career, health, relationships etc.
I’ve had professional help for many years, but nothing they tried has ever worked on me. I believe in the efficacy of professional treatment, but I know that what’s best for me is to have a friend or relative to be around me, to mentor and guide me back towards normalcy. I really wish I had that person in my life, but I am just as bad with relationships. I only have 1 friend as a matter of fact.
Thank you for listening.
Blue.

Hi guys,
26 year old male, been battling depression for as long as I can remember, but only recently acknowledged it to myself.
It is starting to get a lot worse so I am ready to reach out for help.
I am leaving for a 3 week work trip + vacation on Saturday, so ideally I'd like to speak to someone before then to help manage this while I am away.
I don't know if I should be reaching out to a psychologist or a GP, but I know I need help.

Who should I be trying to speak to so I can get an action plan before I head away?
 
Thanks

I want to cry I want to cry I want to cry.. This sadness.. just rises. It is like invisible water that is drowning.. drowning... suffocating... It has been a few days... A few days... I will get through... I can get through this... It is just difficult... It is consuming every bit and piece of my patient... It is exhausting.. exhausting... I know it will eventually go away. It is not away yet.. It is like a dark and thick cloud that covers my head all the time. I have used all my patient and effort to cope.. It is difficult...

I was diagnosed with major depression at 14 as a result of traumatic childhood. Diagnosed with anxiety at 16. And adjustment disorder at 17. I had a serious suicide attempt this time last year. I have come a bit far mentally since then but there is one thing pulling me down. My weight and self image. I have moved into my own place recently as I turned 18 this year. I hate waking up because I’m my bedroom there is a huge mirrored wardrobe. I accidentally look at it every morning and that’s when it starts. I literally speak and say “oh my god look at you you piece of shit” and so on as I walk out my room. I don’t even think about how bad I’m being physically saying those things to myself it’s like a routine. If I sit on the couch and am wearing Pajama shorts and see my legs I have to cover them with a pillow so I don’t see them or I get angry (I would never wear proper shorts or dresses or skirts outside of my house I wouldn’t even wear anything that shows below my elbow) I could make plans with a friend to even simply go to a cafe but I can’t because I can’t find anything to wear and I can’t wear my sport leggings and a big baggy shirt to a nice cafe. So I cancel and it spirals from there everyday I tell myself tomorrow you’re eating healthy and exercising . Does it ever happen? Of course it doesn’t instead I sleep all day and cry about how much I hate myself without doing anything about it then I’ll get over it for a few days and the process repeats . But the other night was the last straw. I went to a club for the first time with my two friends I wore a skirt boots and a baggy kinda top I thought I looked acceptable. I am not one who cares so much about boys of course because I know I’m not worth anything no one would even glance at me. But when you see your friends being danced with all night with boys and being looked at by them and when you’re trying to dance with your friends a group forms with them and boys and you’re pushed out you can’t help but go buy a shot and a drink at the bar to get drunker to help get the feeling away of so much worthlessness and self hate that you want to go to the bathroom and scream and cry about how much you wish you were dead. But we went home I didn’t speak as they were talking about the boys who wanted them. And since then (2 days ago) I am back to my very depressed suicidal self from last year how can I lose weight I can’t live in this body anymore but I can’t change please tell me what to do please

Hey guys,
in a rough patch at the moment
I'm trying to actively do something about it but I'm really finding it hard to know where to turn.
Unrelated to what's bothering me, I'm an active serving member in the ADF, and while we have squillions of resources available to us, attempting to use any of those would have me unable to participate in the only part of my life I still find meaningful.
I investigated using an alias and paying cash to see a GP and then get a referral for a psychiatrist. Doesn't seem to be feasible.
I want to hang on to what is really important to me, but am on the verge of not being able to white knuckle it anymore.
This post is just the first step for me, not a lot in it, but I needed to start somewhere to believe that there is a road to feeling better.
Thanks for reading.

Hi,
I've been depressed about the size of my breasts for 6 years now. I've seen psychologists and they do not seem to be able to help or understand. I've seen the GP and told my mum and other close family and friends and they too do not understand. they tell me the same thing ""that it doesn't matter your breast size"" but they all have large breast sizes so they don't see what i see nor will they ever understand because they don't have a flat chest.
surgery; I've done a lot of research in and have seen a professional...it's very expensive and a lot can go wrong, plus I will have to fork out 10k every 10 years or so to get them changed...so it's not ideal or worth the 50-70K that it will cost me over my life time. 
I am at the end of my ropes really, all i do now is cry and lock myself up in my room - to be left alone.
has anyone ever experienced something similar or have advice to help overcome my depression?

Hi. Female in late 30s. I was formally diagnosed with anxiety and depression about 4-5 years ago but it's been going on for a lot longer than that. I've done exactly what I'm supposed to do - gone to the doctor, juggled around with different medications, and seen psychologists. I feel like now even the doctor is giving up (last visit she asked me what I'd like to do now, no options given, just kind of throwing her hands up as if I was the expert). I'm just getting worse and worse. Gradually less able to function. I can't face going out. I have lost all my friends, no support network left now. Surely after a year of regular psych appointments and medication I should at the very least not be getting worse? Anyone else felt like this? I really don't know what to do.

Hi,
It’s not typical of me to express my feeling as I usually find it intimidating to do so.  However, I have been suffering from a lot of depression and old self hatred from my head.  I wish I didn’t exist in this world. I have been seeing a  psychologist, but obviously didn’t help much at all. 

As a mother, I never set up a good model to my children. Apart from feeding them, I don’t do any extras. No school follow up and not much bonding etc.  I fee so shameful. 

As a wife, I look so ugly and I don’t do make up. At time, I wonder why my husband still stays with me. He can easily find somebody else who is more attractive and more capable. He would deserve more than this... I  am just so useless.

At work, apart from having a postgraduate qualification entry ticket, I only work as a clerk, you can see how low my self esteem is. And you can see how much time and money I have wasted to invest in study. I don’t get high pay and don’t earn any respect from others.  Why can’t  I climb up to the ladder a bit higher to use my skills etc? A Simple answer is that I am worthless!!!

I always believe that I have some sorts of mental problems apart from depression since in my teen.  My Psychologist and GP just don’t have the patience to listen to me or diagnose me!  This vicious cycle goes over and over again forever.. now I don’t know what to do to regain my self-confidence.  I just want to write it down here to release my painful self hatred.

Hi all,
I hope you all had an enjoyable Xmas, lots of yummy food and quality time with the family. I’ve just recently joined the forum and wanted to get some advice about something I’ve been experiencing and any response is much appreciated.
I’ve been feeling more and more weird over this past year. I’m 37, single, no kids, no close friends, and nothing is going on in my life. The worst thing is that I can seem to socialise with people, I just lose my concentration, I blank out, I can’t follow what is being said, my responses are dull and don’t even make sense, I get so anxious that I have nothing interesting to say. People don’t even want to talk to me because of the way I am. Its not their fault really, I also avoid people when I feel this way. It’s starting to affect my work, my life, my everything and I feel so sad. Has anyone ever experienced this? What can I do, really just want to get out of this slump

I hoped that seeing a psychologist would slowly but surely steer me out of depression and isolation, and back into the world of social contact and proper employment again. I have been seeing a  psychologist for 18 months now and while it has been an enormous relief to tell someone what has been going on inside me, and feeling the hurt and painful feelings instead of just pushing them aside as I do with other people, i'm not  actually getting out of my isolation or feelings of fear and unconfidence. It's just that im telling someone and they are being kind about it. In some ways I feel further away from meaningful social contact than I did before. Not that the psychologist has made things worse, just that talking about my sadness doesnt change the conditions that make me sad: unemployment, loneliness, parents dying. How can i ever get better? Will i ever be happy in the world again, make new friends, feel valued again? Or will it always be this now ... for the next how long? 40 years? Fearful, withdrawn, worthless. How is everyone else going? Is there anyone who got very socially isolated, who has found a way back to contact with others? Id be so grateful if someone has ... and could share how it happened. 
best wishes, pawsy

I suffered depression, anxiety and psychosis as a kid. It was without a doubt, the hardest time of my life. Now at over 30 years old with 4 kids I thought those times were behind me, until recently.

I was doing all the 'right' things, getting a house and a career. I was doing everything that you're supposed to do. And I thought I was strong enough to do it all, but I think it all just became too much.
I've all but abandoned my work which I can't do with a mortgage. Last time I was going through this I was a kid without any responsibility, now I'm an adult and a father and everyone looks up to you to do the things that you just know you can't do.
And your partner says she's there for you but you can just see that all you're doing is draining her of her own emotional reserves. Where does it end?
I had a vision of who I wanted to be for my family and it turns out I'm not that person. I'm not strong enough to be who I wanted to be and I don't know what to do to get back to where I want to be.

I don't know if anyone will read this or respond. This is my first post on here. If anyone here is reading I just want to say thank you.
I've been struggling a lot with depression, anxiety and feeling worthless for a while now. Especially around this time of year. I'm 22-Years-Old and for nearly three years I've been working part-time in retail and hospitality. Prior to that I was unemployed for a long time and it hit me really bad with my self-worth. I'm grateful to be working the last couple years now but I still struggle a great deal. 
At age 22 I expected to have my life stable and to be a fully independent individual. I see all over social media people I graduated high school with four years ago now getting engaged, moving out, travelling and finishing college. Meanwhile, I'm working part-time, still living at home, still on my L's, though I've done over 70 hours driving now and I'm.going to be sitting my drivers test this year. I'm only just managing to get by and to save for a car, I dropped out of university when I was 19 due to not knowing what I wanted and being unable to cope. I did a Certificate III in Aged Care in 2018 and completed it but I feel I even struggled with that and I'm scared to go in to a new field of work. I love to help others and make people happy but I feel like I'll mess up as I had a hard time with everything.
I am also lonely, try as I might to seem upbeat and happy I have no close friends. I blame myself for my past in being not the most positive person to be around. I understand my flaws and people's reasoning to maybe why they don't speak to me. That bring sad I've also been deserted many times by friends, can't open up to family and my psychologist I can't see until the end of the month. 
I want to go to college again someday but my mind isn't ready and I'm struggling mentally. I suffer from BPD, anxiety and depression. I feel like a failure and like I live a vicious cycle with mental health, always coming back to feeling like this no matter how much I try. I take antideppressants, recently started going to the gym and I still feel horrible. I'm ashamed for not going to uni or having my life together either. Am I alone in this? Will it always be like this? Am I a failure and stupid like I tell myself? I just needed to vent.
Thank you for reading this far.

It's really been effecting me lately.. to the point I'm depressed for days. I just get better then someone tells me something.. I look into it and what do you know it's a lie and I look like an idiot. I'm a single mum of 2 under 4, everyone knows I'm not coping very well. My ex who I left 5 months ago has a 21 year old girlfriend living with him, I was obsessing over it really badly.. but are getting better until this happens all over again. My dad did it for his own pleasure and a family friend has been coming out with really out there stuff. I dont know why theyre doing this! I find it hard to just ignore it because once ive heard it i cant stop thinking about it. I have no social media, I'm just sick of it!

Hi, I wrote this poem about how I was feeling being a man suffering depression. It's not meant to be a male only thing, but of course I don't know what it is like facing depression as a woman!  
There are some of us who live our lives according to convention,
Knowing there's a part of us we don’t feel free to mention
To others we don't wish to hurt, or who wouldn't understand,
The daily inner struggle that in our lives was never planned

It happens to so many, different backgrounds, different ages
And unfolds just like a story, as we slowly turn life’s pages
As we battle with the sadness deep inside that’s always there
And at times it seems to reach the point we simply cannot bear

Loving husbands, caring fathers, in a never ending fight
As we struggle with our demons, ever present dark as night
And we hold it in, aware that it can tear our lives apart
Too frightened to reveal the truth, and share what’s in our heart

We think no-one can understand the pain and isolation
The complexity, the sadness with no easy explanation
And we ask ourselves, what have I done to end up with this life-
That delivers me such hopelessness and never ending strife?

We wonder how can we go on, get through another night? 
And every day before us is the constant, endless fight
Why me ? what will I become?, how will this anguish end?
But we tell ourselves for now at least, “just continue to pretend”
Our depression seems so constant, causing conflict and divisions
And we worry that ahead of us are difficult decisions
For we are caught, just like a trap, we are not really free
And for some of us we think that is the way it has to be

But we need not walk this road alone, there are many who do care
And if we open up our feelings, and be prepared to share
We will find that there’s assistance, a friendly helping hand
From people who have empathy, who really understand


There is help and great resources, and we all should make that choice
But it does take strength and courage to release our inner voice
Remember we are decent men just living life the best we can
And our inner secret doesn't mean, we're any less a man.

Is it just me or do others tend to find that there depression heightens when the weather is cold, dark and gloomy and then when the weather is beautiful, blue skies, nice warm breeze, suddenly you feel a whole lot better as if the depression almost left with the ugly weather? 
I asked my Psychologist the other month and she said that some people are actually emotionally affected by the weather a lot more than others and it can make our depression worse during the colder months!
If so, does this mean if i travelled around the world, always surrounding myself with blue skies, warmer days and sunny atmospheres that i would concur my depression?
And, just my luck to live in Melbourne where in 1 day,  we can experience all 4 seasons, Wet, Sunny, Windy, Dark, Sunny, Windy!!
 No wonder I'm struggling haha

Hi everyone
I am extremely embarrasssd about what I am going to share, but here goes. 
On the face of it, I am a 33 year old  with a modest job, live in the city in a small apartment that I own. Some may think I’m successful. In reality I have had severe depression for many years and have zero self-worth. A lot of it stems from childhood trauma. I am currently going through the following:
1. I live in squalor. My home is extremely filthy with rubbish everywhere on the floor, clothes everywhere, dusty, cobwebs etc.  Things need to be repaired. My home stinks but I’m so used to it I don’t notice the smell anymore. I am so deeply ashamed and embarrassed about my living circumstances I make excuses to friends/family to not invite them over. This is not a lifestyle choice, I hate it.  But I am so overwhelmed by the squalor I don’t know what to do or where to start. I fee paralysed by my lack of motivation. 
2. Self neglect. For example, although I shower everyday, I don’t wash my hair frequently. I only wash my hair once a month or two. It’s itchy and I get scabs on my head.  I have long curly hair down to my waist that most people would say is beautiful. I hide it by tying it back in a bun. I love the feeling of clean freshly washed hair, but I just can’t bring myself to do it. I struggle doing basic tasks at home like pay the bills on time (not because I can’t afford it). I can’t explain it, it’s like a strong brick wall in my head stopping me from doing tasks. I also compulsively pick my skin. I have scabs/sores on my chest, legs and worst of all my face. I have had this one scab on my face for 3 years because of the urge to pick. My mum once made a comment that the scab on my face makes me look like a meth user (I don’t do drugs and I rarely drink, though I am a heavy smoker).  There are other things but I won’t go into detail.
i literally feel like trash.
Has anyone else experienced  forms of self neglect and squalor? How did you tackle it?  Does anyone know of any online support groups for squalor?

Hi all,
so lately my emotions are out of control 
not only do I feel like everyone is on a different page then me I know they are
never in my life would I put someone down to feel good about my self, I’ve resentently decovered that no one else seems to think the same way .
I started a new job and found that working with people is way harder then I remember, I am finding it hard and at the moment I’m just not able to cope with the smallest this without bursting into tears 😭 
ive always been such a strong person and I don’t understand why this is happening 
the last few years has been mentally and physically straining, I’ve been really sick and I don’t mean cancer, but it was bigger then the flu, I went from being able to run to not even being able to stand with out being in constant pain. I’m now at the point I can stand for 15 mins before pain sets in still really can’t walk for to long I get around 20mins before needing a rest but I still can’t shift the weight that was stacked on with all the hormones that were unbalanced .
at that point I was feeling low and angry so I went to see my doc and got some meds they seamed to have worked and I was not as angry or upset all the time, deciding I wanted to make the choice to go of them 
I was so wrong I’ve started a new job and the bull that comes with that has sent me on a mental downwards spiral , I spent all last night crying my eyes are so sore today I can barely see what I am typing, i had a script of a mild does of my meds so last night I started on them again 😔 and I’m booked into see a doc on Friday.
im just wanting to talk to someone I just can’t control anything now and I thought if I can have a chat it may help 
any one up for a chat ?

Hi.. first post that hopefully passes the rules!! Need some staying on track over ‘festive’ season where judt feel like a loser (who can’t type!!!).
bipolar 2, recently been hospital for overdose and had ect, precious/ continue eating disorders: issues .
been trying to stay off the piss bit keep drinking when happy or sad. Feel like loser and keep doing it -  2 kids 9 and 11 and struggle to read to them when on the piss. Bring such bad example but otherwise good to them.
failing self, kids and hubby what s fool I am 
dont know how to stop would think being hospitalised would fix but have realised have so few real friends, hard to feel that any one I see gives a damn. Of all people I know only 3 people made contact her I was in the nut house. No one from my full time work - been there 7 years, they send flowers to everyone else who is crook,! Find it hard to work out what is wrong with me.

But not sad things in my life, my life is actually great. I think about completely random things. The level of sadness completely varies. E.g. sometimes it would just be a father and son having an argument, but sometimes it would be a man being dying violently in front of his wife. Yep, that escalated quickly. There are others, those are just two examples.

You're probably thinking it represents something that's happened in my life, but it really didn't. I have a great relationship with my parents, and I've never witnessed real death or violence.

I don't think it's depression, because I'm not exactly sad for no reason. I start off completely happy, but then I get these thoughts, and I feel really sad for the next few hours. What could it be?

This is the first time i have really done anything like this. I have never spoken to anyone about how i truly feel or whats going on inside my mind because for some reason i don't know how to explain what i feel. I haven't been able to sleep and i have never felt so lonely. I have lost all of my mates for no reason. All i do is help everyone because i know how it feels to hurt, i know how it feels to be bullied so bad you believe the fake rumours about you. I work so hard all the time and try to do peoples jobs or help so they have a good day at work and all i get is more work or staff members tell me i don't work hard enough and that because I'm a female i should make them a coffee because I'm not doing anything. Everything i used to love doing i can't get into anymore, i don't feel inspired and i am to tired to do anything. I have anxiety and depression. These past 2 years i have been so sick, first with tonsillitis so bad i was in bed for 2 weeks straight, then a bad case of glandular fever and then minor surgery. I have been so isolated that i can't connect with people anymore. I was so bubbly and happy but now I'm shy and scared to open up to people because I'm afraid they will leave me like most people have. I can't stop crying when I'm alone and i can't help but wonder if i should just leave. The only 2 people who are keeping me here are my parents. But they don't know what I'm going through because i don't want to worry them. I just don't know what to do anymore. Im so tired of feeling like i don't belong anywhere and being lonely. Ive lost who i used to be and i don't know how to become someone who loves life and enjoys the things i used to love. Someone please help me, i don't know how much longer i can do this for anymore.

Hi All,

My Name is Colin, I've been reading a lot about people's experiences about depression. Trying to figure out what is wrong with me.

My Story.

Around 5 weeks ago something happened to me that utterly destroyed my confidence (I won't bore you but talked to my GP and friends about it). I felt absolutely worthless, like I didn't exist and like a piece of crap. 

After a week or so later I thought I was ok but the tiniest little thing annoyed me, I started taking things far to seriously (Still do but I am trying my best on positive thoughts). Slowly things got worse, some days were ok but most of them were not. I would get extremely lonely, cry and question myself a lot.

About two weeks ago I broke down, not acting myself and my family reached out to me but being a man I said I was ok. Few days later I googled for signs/syptoms of what I was going through, thought I can handle this, I'm a man we are tough!

No, when I got home from work last Monday I was ok but during the evening I broke down again and said some stupid things to the nicest people on this planet. I had so many negative thoughts running through my mind, again questioning myself, am I good enough, am I even appreciated you name it I questioned it. This time it was bad, worse then before but I eventually realised that I need proper help.

On top of that I have been barely eating, hardly sleeping barely 4 to 5 hours a day if that. Even on my so called good days I was still self doubting myelf.

I took that first step and reached out to here via email, explained everything and suggested I go to a GP asap. I also took the K10 quiz and rated 32.

Today I went to see a GP, I was extremely nervous and at the point of being sick before I went, even thought of skipping it I was that bad.

But glad I didn't, she made me feel so comfortable, went through the K10 test (was very high) sent me off for a blood test for my thyroid and I booked myself into see a psychologist. She was absolutely amazing and extremely helpful.

Before this I was a very happy, energetic and positive person. I even had my gallbladder taken out and had so much pain prior to that the surgery was a breeze even recovery, but this.. this scares me, scares me a lot.

The hardest thing I had to do was take that first step, it was hard! But I am glad I did so I can get help, I'm by no means 100% but I am determined to fight this and get better!.

Thank you for listening ❤❤❤

I recently had a revelation ..maybe it’s been an overdone thing ...I’m not sure but I feel the need to highlight it to people who have depression and also to serve as a gentle reminder to myself .
 I have cut out a few friends and choosing to have no friends ...rather than having friends that are ..not quite there for me . 
So now ..I am my own best friend ,,,really ...sometimes it doesn’t always turn out that way though ..hahah because I am sometimes unkind to myself . I say stuff like that ..omg u so useless etc  but u all know that negative voice in our head ,
why cant we just be consistently kind to ourselves ? Why do we fall back into the enemy’s hands time and again ?

I hope this is allowed.. I'm just wondering if anyone on medication for bipola finds that it suppresses intrusive thoughts? I used to struggle with being in the dark, or if I read an article in a magazine or seen a scene on a show or a movie that was a bit dark or gruesome.. my mind would go utter haywire and conjure up some pretty horrid thoughts. I'm totally grateful that the meds help with this but the psychologist told me my intrusive thoughts were more to do with anxiety. Guess my question is are intrusive thoughts a part of bipola?

Im not depressed. At least I haven't been diagnosed. And I don't think I am, I'm happy. So many things in my life are great I'm happy overall but there a days where that happiness isn't really..there. 
Like tonight. 
I miss my bsf who I made the horrible decision to leave after convincing myself she was toxic. And I guess she was, but it wasn't her fault. The way I left her was really bad too and I am so riddled with guilt for it bc I loved her. I really did and I can't hate her like everyone else did and I always wonder what would have happened if I had stayed. 
I also feel really alone. I have this amazing group of friends and an amazing boyfriend but I've realized now I've never been able to tell anyone anything when I'm struggling. And it's been getting worse as the years go by but I just don't have anyone. No one knows me, I would carry the weight of all my friends but it always feels like no one knows me enough ti help with mine so if no one knows me whats the point? Whats the point of saying anything when people won't know how to respond or won't understand.
No one says the right things I guess. And I know its selfish of me bc they try to understand but it'd be nice to have one person who would know what to do. I've told my friends before when I'm anxious I'll separate myself bc thats what helps me. I don't like being surrounded when I'm anxious but whenever I try to separate myself all my friends cling by my side or sit next to me and touch me and makes me feel worse and I know I should tell them but they're just trying to help. They're genuinely the most woke people I know and they're so open and everything.
But I just feel so disconnected from them at times. When they all enjoy themselves and eachothers company and I'll have good laughs with them and we'll talk about all thats wrong with the world and all thats right and we compliment and love eachother but there are times like tonight where I feel that even though I love them so much I just don't... its not that I don't fit in. Im sure I do, I just feel like I'm that person thats going walk away because I just have to move on? It sounds bad, I can't really describe why I feel like I have to leave but its there
These feelings started a few months ago and they reappear every so often and everytime they do I have no one. Whenever I try to talk to a friend I picture them and how they'd react or how happy they've been lately and decide that I can't.
Someone tell me whats wrong? Or snd me advice? ty❤️

Yesterday i had the most horrid meltdown. I dont know why? I think it is stress but i dont know. I usually try to be positive as i work in aged care but lately its getting harder and harder to put that happy face on. Partner is not working so all pressure is on me to get bills paid. And im struggling. And its causing me to feel animosity towards him especially when hes not even looking for a job. Normally christmas is awesome but with our current situation financially i cant get the presents etc this year and its making me feel like a failure. I tried to tell my partner yesterday when i finally broke down after feeling like this for months that i feel like im sinking further and further into a bottomless dark abyss with no way out. His response was unsupportive. I dont think he understands how severe the feelings of hopelessness are and i dont like to be a drama queen but i dont know what to do. Ugh!

 I just had an awful experience with a business that charged me for a service they'd cancelled, which is music lessons for my daughter.  The teacher quit and the business continued to charge me whilst my daughter didn't have any lessons.  They told me to take my business elsewhere when I asked for a refund.   Then told me they have great feedback so there must be something wrong with me, when I said I wasn't happy with their service .   This has set me into feeling really low and right now I don't have the energy to pursue my refund or deal with this business.  I know this doesn't sound like much but I have a lot on my plate and this was the straw that broke my back.   Which is what happens to me.   I'll be travelling along OK but really things are building up till it all overflows and then I struggle.   Wondering if others have suggestions on managing this cycle and managing things when everything overflows.

Hi, this is my first time posting. I’ve always had fairly low self-esteem and low confidence, but lately it feels like every time I build myslef up, someone is there to knock me back down. 
 
I’m half greek and half kiwi so growing up, nobody really looked like me. I was always comparing myself to others and haven’t felt completely happy with my appearance in a while. 
 
Tonight I was feeling ok about myself. I got dressed up to go for drinks with some work friends to celebrate the end of the year, and was feeling pretty good.  They are all pretty good looking people. There was this guy in the club who basically said to my face that I wasn’t pretty like my friends. 
 
I don’t know why it even got to me because he’s just some stranger, but that isn’t the first time someone has said something like that. It’s like they don’t get that it hurts to hear you’re not pretty.  I don’t understand why it keeps happening but it hurts and I don’t know how to change it. 
 
I can’t really talk to family and friends anout this because it’s embarrassing to admit and they don’t really get it. Does anyone else ever feel like this? I just feel kind of lonely and like I’ll never find someone to love me, for me. And yes I know i’m not likely to find that person at a club.

hello I am really lonely and my job is not forfilling anymore because we have nothing to do I sit for 7 hours a day infront of a computer just pretending to do work, while other people walk passed as they do not have a lot to do either. I need somewhere to share rent and live with very soon and this is stressing me out as well. I have tried Salvation Army, and other charities and they do not have any support groups either. It would give me hope to get out of bed each day knowing I am helping someone else thru the same feelings and encourage them just like your posts on fb and they would encourage me. please help warm regards from sam.

I regularly see posts saying to use different techniques to help their depression. Things like:
Relaxing music, breathing, exercise, exercise, sleep, diet etc.
How on earth do you do any of this when you are depressed? I certainly can't. I can't sleep properly, can't exercise, I listen to loud music and eat junk. The last thing I feel I can do it the above recommendations.
How do you do it?
Thanks

I will be turning 30 next year and my life is turning to shit and I am falling into depression. I am stuck in a relationship that I don't want to be in any more. I want to leave but we still have six months left of our lease so I haven't ended it yet. I don't have a full time job so I am stressing because it will be expensive to live by myself but I don't have any other option. I won't be able to look for work for a few months either as I am recovering from surgery. I don't even know what work I will be able to or want to do. I always thought by 30 I would have a career path but after other jobs not working out I am back to square one. I just want to get away from everything at the moment. I want to travel with some of my savings but I know that if I am away too long it will affect my job seeking and I will feel bad for leaving my dog. I had been saving for a house deposit but realised it is an impossible dream. I hate not being able to be independent. I feel like a failure.

It sure is nice to come across a person with empathy. We dont ask for much but such is our mental challenges and feelings of isolation, we respond well to a few caring and encouraging words.
One of the reasons some cannot reach out is, logically, they cannot see the injury. A broken leg will fing others swarming to assist, asking about how it occured and moves to make you comfortable. Not so with mental illness unless you are one of 20% that understand either from having one, being a carer or that empathetic quality.
Then there could be the jealousy factor. A high rate of envy can be present if you arent working. If you have some good days and immerse yourself in your hobby, that wont reflect well to your friend working their 37 hour week. ""Its alright for you, we dont have down time like you"" a friend recently said to me"". I wanted to scream out ""I'll swap you""!
Then there are the people without any capacity to comprehend MI. These people might well care for you...they just dont ""get it"". Be aware, such friends might seriously love you.  They just cannot ""walk in your shoes"".
Finally there are the non believers. These people will harbour thoughts you are dodging work or seeking sympathy. I often reply ""so psychiatrists study for 15 years but you can diagnose without any study at all""? 
Sadly many of these people above have to be avoided/discarded from our lives if we are to seek harmony, stability and self esteem. Google-

Nearly 2 months ago I found out I was pregnant. My partner and I have been on and off for 1.5 years after a 2 year relationship. Together we made the decision that I wasn’t going to have it. Not a decision made lightly. A few days later he abandoned me, wouldn’t return my calls or messages and blocked my number. I went through this stressful time on my own without his support. I can’t understand what I have done to be treated like this. I pretend to be okay but deep down in falling into a deep
Depression where I don’t think I’ll ever get over it and feel better.
Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can overcome this.

I’M French and 33 years old. Icame to
Australia (backpacking) and then met my boyfriend. We love each other very much. (been together
for 10 years) however he is a very popular person and has a lot of friends. Me
on the other side I have no friends at all. Well I have his friends but we
don't have a lot in common. they like to socialise by drinking. which is fine
but I don't drink and realised that if you don't drink then you don't socialise
a lot here in Perth. I prefer to be outdoor. I have recently been
separated from my one and only best friend she went back to France after
breaking up with her partner. This has been heartbreaking for me. I was crying every
day for 2 months. I have never felt so sad in my entire life. I miss her very
much. She was my buddy, the one eating dessert and drinking tea with. I know
sounds boring but that was our ""French Time"". I have been seeing a psychologist
for 3 months and then stopped as I felt better. 
My partner just started
the cricket season so he plays every Saturday. I know it's no big deal but for
me when comes the weekend instead of looking forward to spend time with the
loved ones I get anxious about spending another day alone. I don't have any
family here so my partner is everything to me. I think this is a lot of
pressure on him. I don't blame him but at the same time I have left everything
behind and stayed here. I have been trying all sorts of meeting group but found
myself not fitting in any group. It's whether 50+ walking groups, or young mums
or youngsters wanting to party. I'm in my thirties with no kids... at that age
you are married with kids or single. I'm in the middle.
I have also a lot of Malaysian
people around me. they are lovely however always wanting to do something the Asian
way. I love it too but being French it's a bit of a culture difference.
I feel stuck and don't know how to meet new people.
I have become grumpy and I look depressed all the time. vicious circle. I spent
the last weekend locked in the spare room crying because I had another argument
with my boyfriend about me not having any friend. there is nothing he can do I

Hi there,
I’m feeling incredibly down right now and can’t even bring myself to eat. I have no appetite at all. Does anyone have any tips on what to do?
I’ve barely been able to focus at work and have spent all of my free time lying in bed. Everything feels like way too much right now and I just don’t know what to do. I usually see a psychologist but right now I can’t see her again until next month. I’m feeling very stuck and trapped inside my own mind and would appreciate any advice. 
Thanks

Ive recently achieved most of the goals i set for myself.
I got the job i wanted, even though its casual i have secured a full time position with them already to start in january.
I got the car i wanted.
And ive finally moved out of my mums place, my son and i couldnt be happier.
 
 
But now the only things left on that list of goals is to get married, have more kids and go on a cruise.
Since making my goals come true ive never been happier, and knowing ill have that fulltime work after the 3 month probationary period is a huge delight, i dont need to worry about that anymore.
But i cant help but feeling incredibly lonley, realising how lonley i am now actually bought me to tears earlier. Being in my own place, it feels so empty with just me amd my son. I think constantly how amazingit woukd be to come home to my partner, or have that someone to talk to after work. I often feel terrible because my son will never have any close siblings.
 
Its a nice feeling ticking off those goals but i kinda wish i hadnt just so my mind would be on somethi g other than having someone special. Its just becoming so hard to make some new goals because settling down and going on a cruise are the inly things i have left to want.
 
How do you deal with lonliness? And setting goals.

I used to believe I had polar, but after 10 years experience I found I was a we, we have DID and no clue what to do or where to turn for help.  So far my professionals have helped me with comments like 'thats rare', and the like.  We, Jack who I've lived with for thirty years, and I are constantly fighting for control of our human's head.  J. the good guy who's mostly in charge, spends his life trying to sort out Jack's disasters.  So far he's driven away my wife, my daughters and my brother who happens to be a social worker, that's why I maintain nobody knows.  On the off chance somebody does know, please help me.

Not sure why I'm even writing this here but, I guess I'm looking for help, something positive, anything really.
I am seriously at the end of my tether. 2018 started out so fantastic and I was super grateful for everything coming my way in my business and in general. Then something happened. I started drinking again, was completely off it in January/Feb which was great, it does me no favours. Then the months rolled on up till now. My business is dying with a lack of clients, good clients and I feel like I have made all the mistakes a person can. It has cost me dearly. I can't even pay myself a wage and contribute to the home right now. My Wife is working and she covers it all. I know she's not happy about it at all and fair enough. 
The last 2-3 months have almost killed me. We tried to get finance to buy a new place and move, it took that long because they stuffed up! At the last minute despite being told it was all ok, they declined it. It all fell back on me and my inability to have good money coming in. We lose out because of me not having all this and miss out on doing good things. I know my Wife is pissed off about it all, let down because of me.
I feel so worthless, unwanted and unloved (with the exception of my little girl). Feel like my Wife regrets getting involved with me, she's not interested in me right now because of all this. I have nothing, no assets, zip. I'm not lazy and I do work hard to do well but, obviously, I don't have what it takes, should have stayed an employee. It is my fault that it all happened. She wants me to get a job which is fair enough. It depresses me so much that it's come to this, I've failed, ruined a lot of things, it's very embarrassing. I have no one to talk to about it, get help from, advice, ideas, nothing. Feel like my Wife doesn't want to hear it, we can't even have a friendly conversation about it.
I am trying to do things, get a job and manage things in the background. It's a bad time of year for it though. I am stuck in concrete and can't move, think clearly. If I didn't wake up tomorrow, I'd be ok with that, except my little girl would be devastated. I have nothing and no one right now and it really sucks. Feel like we should get divorced so she can get on with it and not have me around dragging her down. Sorry if I'm ranting here, just really stuck. Thanks.

Hi all, just looking for some support or to hear from people who have felt the same.
After working in a job that went against my values (to put it briefly), I developed mild depression. I quit that job after a year, and was unemployed for a number of months before finding my current job. I did find another job during my period of unemployment, however didn't last long before my depression got the better of me.
I have worked in my current job for over a year and feel very comfortable. I love my coworkers and the work that I do. I think part of why I've done so well is because I started taking anti-depressants a month before I began in my role. 
I recently applied for a promotion for a role that will be in a different area. It's been strongly hinted that I have the job. I'm both proud, and terrified.
I've come so far in the past year. My mental health has improved, and I don't wake up wishing I could quit my job.
I'm terrified that moving to another role will take me back to who I used to be. I'm worried that maybe my happiness comes from having such good coworkers, and my new coworkers wont be as good. And what if the work isn't as stimulating or enjoyable? In a way, I'm scared of myself.
I'm probably overthinking, but these thoughts are upsetting me. How can I help myself?

I really don't know what to do anymore, over the last few years I've watched myself fall into this dark black hole with no light at the end of the tunnel. I once cared for so much, wanted to achieve my goals and better myself and now i feel my depression stripping me of everything that made me who i was. All i feel everyday is pain, anger and despair, I lost enjoyment from the things i once loved and find no sense of accomplishment from what i do achieve. I lost my job due to stress physically affecting me and causing me to become ill, i told them the truth and what i was going through but after two weeks off trying to recover i was fired. I'm stuck with myself everyday now, all the thoughts and feelings i cannot make sense of which causes me to question my sanity at times. I have no family or friends to turn too for help, the loneliness over the last few months has become overwhelming and add everything else on top and all i want to do is sleep to escape the pain. Im becoming tired of fighting to only end up going backwards and letting my emotions control me. I am currently getting professional help though it hasn't been helpful as of yet. I wish i could pull myself out of this hole but i simply don't have the strength and determination to do so.

Dear everyone 
I’m at home alone not only feeling sorry for myself, butnot knowing what to do with myself, with my AIAI (Anxiety, Irritability, and Agitation Index) steadily creeping up. The reason: my family have quite rightly gone to one of my good friend’s 50th birthday party. I just couldn’t get ready to get myself there.
There are/were multiple reasons for this, including social anxiety, fear regarding being able to NOT drink alcohol (this is a bunch of friends who drink a LOT, most of my friends do),and mental and physical exhaustion having just returned from a 4 night walking trek in Tassie. I did have a couple glasses every night in Tassie and this resulted in me feeling terrible both yesterday and today and hence felt even less like going to a “party” and even more desperate to avoid alcohol.
Im very interested to hear about other people’s experiences and coping mechanisms in these situations. I have managed several work Xmas parties (really have to go to those coz I’m the boss) but really have no interest in large group parties. Is it reasonable not to attend some of them? I love catching up in small groups but dislike extremely the large parties where you might barely get to speak to the guest of honour anyway.
Kind regards
JD

Hi, I just joined today.  
I've been battling with depression for the last 10 years. Thought I had it under control for the last few, but lost my job about 6 months ago and I seem to have fallen into the hole again. 
 Went to first appointment with a psychologist today.  Got a good vibe from him and think he can help.  Only it's stirred up a lot of memories that I haven't visited for a while. 
 Any advice on how to calm down your mind when you start over thinking and over analysing?
Anyway hello all and thanks for listening/reading.

I'm 32 years old and have barely ever talked about my depression. Whenever I talk about it I don't know how. when I do open up I feel like I'm lying about it and that other people have their own problems so why would I talk about my life, coz my life is text book easy really. Also I don't want people's sympathy or apathy. But sometimes I feel so overwhelmed like I need to get something out, it makes me feel so lonely and empty coz I don't know where to go. Sometimes I try to talk to my husband, but he doesn't understand or he feels my feelings of worthlessness makes him feel bad that his not good enough or I'm not happy with him. 
I just don't know if I just keep pushing myself through life, I've managed to do well so far, or do I try to talk about with someone? Is it worth it? What do I even talk about? - hi I've struggled with depression on off for years but manage it pretty well these days but still feel like I'm drowning deep down.and???? What happens after that how does it make it better?

Hello everyone,

26, Male, Adelaide, Husband, Father (of 1)

The history of my relationship with depression over the past few years is up and down to say the least so I’ll try and explain it as briefly. During my early twenties I was experiencing a lot of muscle pain and migraines, after seeing all sorts of practitioners the symptoms basically went undiagnosed. They were preventing me from doing what I loved most which was sport and physical exercise. When I left Uni and traveled interstate to commence full time work for the first time, I now had the money to spend to investigate these issues further. So I spent 1000’s of dollars visiting physios, osteopaths, doctors, chiros, exercise physiologists, doing training programs etc. None of these people could find a problem and the pain was becoming worse and worse and ended up being the only thing I could think of. It got to the point where I just broke down. I couldn’t think anymore, I was depressed, in pain etc. It was affecting my work, my relationship, everything. At this point I came to the conclusion that it had to be me, so in tears I sort the help of a psychologist. It was then when I realised that I was under constant stress (relationship, uni, sport, work) and was on edge all the time. From an early age, I just wanted everything to be perfect and didn't have an off switch. I was convinced that due to my personality, I just put way too much pressure on myself all the time which caused the muscle pain and now the mental problems.

For the past 6 months I have been on anti-depressants, practised mindfulness meditation, adopted adaptogen herbs, exercised, maintained sleep and focussed on reducing stress. This has helped somewhat to the point I can function again, however I still go through the fight, flight and freeze response (to varying degrees) throughout a weekly period. Some days, I just can’t think and this will last for almost a week, where my productivity plummets. This used to stress me out further, however I have learned to roll with the punches more and wait for the episode to be over. As it seems the more
I do this, the fewer and farther in between these episodes occur. Right now, I am going through heavy a brain freeze/fog period, so just writing this post is difficult.

I could go on forever talking about this but I am coming close to the word limit, so I will stop it here for now and look forward to any responses of people going through anything similar.

I am currently attending day therapy programs two days a week. It helps. I have had some success this year - I had $27,800 HECS debt removed and now a legal firm has agreed to help me, pro bono to take the last two Universities to the AAT for another $16,000 HECS debt.I am just feeling so trapped, I have put on so much weight because of the meds. It really makes it hard for me to leave the house and make friends, I feel like a whale. I just stopped taking the medication two days ago and my appetite is gone, I'm not hungry at all.I am in a heap of debt, on one hand it is reducing rapidly, I am fortunate to have a DSP, then I get so frustrated because I can't move out because 85% of my income goes off the debt. With 2 days of therapy, 3 full days of TAFE is so overwhelming. I feel like by the time my finances are fixed I'll be too old to have children. Uuugggghhhhhham sick of feeling so anxious and depressed and frustrated. I'd welcome any tips or suggestions. I know there are positives and I try to focus on the positives, it's just so overwhelmingly frustrating.thanks for listening

I feel trapped by my anxiety and depression on the inside I feel numb, lifeless and empty. I'm an almost 26 year old female who now lives back at home with her mum.I feel this sense of hopelessness and guilt living back at my mum's again.I feel as though I'm a burden on her especially since I have my dog and cat moving in with me too.I have recently broken up with my partner of almost 9 years.The last 6 years living with him I feel as tho I have been constantly lied to about my future by my ex partner. I dropped everything and moved an hour away from my family and friends to be with him and start a future together. Now I feel like I've just lost 6 years of my life I'll never get back.I suffer from anxiety and depression have done now for almost 10 years. I'm on DSP due to my anxiety being so bad I can't work. My last and only job I ever had worked was 6 years ago in childcare I loved my job but my anxiety really affected my ability to work. It got to much so I ended up leaving also because at the time I ended up moving with my now ex partner to another town.I feel in my position now I have a very difficult future ahead of me. I'm not improving much with my mental health and feel as though I'm losing my independence.I live in an area with not a great deal of support for my mental health also. I've been waiting 3 months to see a psychologist and I still can't get an appointment made yet.I would love to start a new life again where I could meet someone who I could actually trust.As well as gaining more independence and a place of my own to live. I've always wanted children as well one day but this all seems impossible now. Without a job or the ability to go out and socialize and meet new people my life is going nowhere. I don't want to be stuck in this situation for ever.

Hi
 I am new to posting but have been through a tough time in the last three months
I have lost all confidence, and feel completely incapable of holding down a job as a result of unrealistic deadlines, lack of support from my supervisor and having my work openly criticised in an open plan office.  My emails were edited constantly and I was not allowed to send anything without the manager editing it.  I was told my listening skills needed to improve and that I should never be late for meetings.  If I was in back to back meetings, my young manager or supervisor would come into the meeting to tell me I was late.
I am over 50 and this is the first time I have been so sick and the first time with depression and anxiety.  It has resulted in nearly three months off work, unpaid and numerous trips to specialists and doctors. When i briefly returned the head of the department didn't even ask how I was.
I requested another position as I said that work had made me sick and was offered another one with a supportive manager however my confidence is non existent and I am struggling to believe I am able to do any job.
This has resulted in sleepless nights, panic attacks, desperation and feelings of hopelessness.
I really want to work but am scared I wont be able to do the job.  How do I get confidence back.  I have just been signed off again, as i am so fragile every time I think about work I get into a panic. 
Can anyone give me any advice.

I don't know if this helps or makes things worse but I write poetry about how I am feeling. This is one:
Hurt:
And so it goes
 The story of to and fros
The ups and downs
Will sadden the happiest of clowns

Scared of the pain 
You are the one left to drain

Each week has a new low
You have become life’s little hoe

Nothing inside is left to hurt
Your heart torn out and stomped in the dirt

The pain turns physical
A razor is now seen as clinical

The loss of a friend
Another step closer to the end

You push and mislead
They want to help and do a good deed

Your mind is now your worst enemy
Will you ever find some form of clarity?

Your hurt and scared
Are you too damaged to be repaired? 

Allow people in please!
The pain will begin to ease

Dont be scared of this monster 
Be the hero of the story 
Tame the beast and learn to conquer

Hi All, 
this might sound really heartless but I am no longer sure what to do. I have been with my husband for 9 years and he has suffered from periodic depression ever since I have known him and likely before. Every year, a crisis triggered by him would spiral us down a dark hole, ending with him saying hurtful things to me, doubting the relationship and me as the right partner and, in the end, he would bring up separation or divorce. For nine years, I have accepted this behaviour and felt for him because whenever he came out of the hole, he said that this was actually not how he felt and that he could not imagine a life without me. However, it has caused me lasting pains and doubts that our relationship dynamics will ever change. Also, he is often so indifferent about everything and I am coming to a point where I wonder whether my basic needs, such as being able to share joy with a special someone, are actually met. I know this sounds quite selfish because he does nice little things for me and when we have a good time, it is great. But I feel that every year, I am happy for 50% and then, after the crisis, I start rebuilding my emotional strength again for the other 50%. And even then I have moments when I sometimes wonder whether we are just too different - or he maybe always affected by some mild depression that keeps him low, indifferent and not very passionate. He is seeing a psychologist and I have been lately, too, because we had another crisis that was very hard for me to deal with. He knows he needs the therapist's help, which is great and I am sure he is slowly making progress. But since this year, I no longer know whether I can wait that long because I assume improvement will take a long time. I am so tired and exhausted by all this and I am so sad when I look back at nine years of nice and terrible times alike. A relationship should not be THAT hard, or should it? I no longer know what to do. I love him but I feel there has been a lot of damage done and most of all, I am just not sure I can continue living my life with a person that seems never happy or satisfied for long. It is like constantly driving on a bumpy road and occasionally you get some patches of smooth ride. I feel I have given my best but I am worried that I will give my needs up for something that will never get better. Especially as he now feels a need for kids and it gets him down because I never wanted them and will not have them. So there's another reason for him to be down.

I'm happy to claim my depression has taken a holiday. Well I forced it to, it had no choice. Sometimes things in life need a heavy hand or out witting them. Coming up with strategies might need your own ideas as our depression is very individual. There can be some similarities however- let's explore some.
If you over think issues, possibilities then you might have too much free time on your hands. When I have a project (like building our caravan) that takes calculations and focus...I'm rarely dwelling on family issues or the local narcissist person in town.
Distraction does work, seriously work! I used to have a large jigsaw in a spare room. Each time I dwelled on a toxic family member I'd retreat and do a dozen pieces. It worked.
The saying ""get a life"" can be interpreted in a nasty way but as with all things in life I focus on the facts and benefits...get a life is sort of true...a sport, a hobby, a second job..its the best way to minimalise the effects some people have on us, so we can move forward from mayhem.
Another saying - ""dont sweat the small stuff"". CEO's or owners of large companies leave the small stuff to people down the line. Federal politicians dont involve themselves with planning permits for houses, that's done by local Govt.  Hence work towards filtering issues in your life to find peace away from small issues.
Eg inlaws. My first marriage resulted in a few toxic inlaws that, for no clear motive, caused havic in the family. I decided, after several attempts to offer peace that ""I married my wife, not her family"". This new attitude resulted in my peace of mind. Those few inlaws no longer have the ""feed"" they needed to continue with undue criticism. As time went by they had no issues to satisfy their jealousy (which was the real issue).
There is a significant percentage of narcissistic people in our world. I'd guess around 10-20%. That's a lot. You have little choice but to withdraw and minimalise your head space of them.
These actions and distractions away from negative influences might result in some level of isolation. It will feel that you are building a wall of safety...well that's exactly what it is.
And only allow the qualified to enter. That's your right. There is no obligation to entertain the nasty,  just love the caring...

I've been on medication for quite a number of years and I recently fulfilled a new script but the chemist gave me a different brand and since then I've been feeling jittery in my body, have waves of feeling like I just can't be bothered, have trouble sleeping and I just don't feel like myself. I haven't changed anything else except added a fish oil tablet to my diet. Should I speak with my chemist or my doctor? The medication looks the same!

Im not even sure if this is the right place to be asking for this kind of advice, but im at the end of my tether i literally don't know where else i can turn. i figure on here there might be someone who will at the very least have a listen. Basically up until June, i was employed as a refrigeration apprentice in my second year. Then the company i was working for went into bankruptcy leaving me unemployed, i no shit applied for probably 50 apprenticeships just trying to find a company to take me on and let me finish my apprenticeship. being a mature apprentice at the ripe age of 24 that was alot easier said then done. So that was in June, i managed to find some part time work which has tied me over until a month ago but apparently i wasnt what they were looking for and got sacked. so essentially im absolutely ruined right now, my rent runs out this week, i have no food, i cant even put fuel in my car to go to interviews and who knows how much longer my phone is going to stay connected, and the little savings i did have are all but dried up now. I have been applying like a crazy man to try and find any work, but this close to Christmas theres just nothing where i live. Im at the point where i just want to give up, im beyond tired, the joys been gone for a while now and its just struggle after struggle. im the only one whose got my back and realize im the only one who can help myself but i wouldnt even know where to begin and am not even sure i care anymore. its like pull myself out of this hole just to work in another shitty job barely earning enough to survive anyway, whats the point. i guess the very fact im on here, tells me im not done just yet but come Thursday when i get kicked out of my house, I don't see me coming back from that and just before Christmas too. It actually makes me laugh in a way like how the heck did i get here.

Thirty years ago a work accident crippled me. On escape from rehab my ex insisted on me taking up beer again.  After I got compensation I began a business with her she did the books I worked on computers.  Business wasn't good due to depression issues and being put in psychiatric hospital; so I got my mum to send me $24000 to cover a mortgage. My ex was doing the books and when I got out of hospital my ex refused to let me in the house because I was two dangerous.  My land was sold by the bank due to the money disappearing, oddly my ex was able to buy a car and renovate the house she had taken as settlement for separation. Since asking my kids for help finding the money they have all blocked me from any contact after showering me with abuse for carrying on so about the money. I made accusations and got no denials.  How do I cope with losing my family and all my possessions, given in good faith for their support.  The ultimate ingratitude.

I just saw this article on social media and my jaw dropped as I can tick most of the symptoms for BPD.

Don't know what to do?
Should I see a psychologist?
Or are these symptoms also seen with other disorders?

I've experienced a number of episodes of depression, which have in the past come good with changes in medication, but I feel at a loss about what to do this time.  It's inescapable that my current relapse was the result of talking with my doctor about some difficult issues growing up and I really struggle with the fact that talking about something that happened so many years ago (I'm now in my late 30's) could have such a profound effect on my mood.  
I'm not sure how to get through this current episode.  A medication change doesn't seem right because after trialling about 4-5, my current medication has been working well up until now.  I find it really difficult to talk to my doctor when I'm in the throes of depression anyway (I've never really quite worked out why) and the fact that my current relapse was caused by talking has reinforced that.  My next doctor's appointment is just under two weeks away and I'm considering cancelling it, even though in the past my doctor has helped me through some very bleak times, because I only feel worse when I can't fully articulate how I'm feeling.  At my last visit, my doctor suggested I go into hospital but I don't see that as an option.  Work is the only place where I feel like I'm coping at the moment and I don't want to lose that.  Also, I have been in hospital once before and I didn't find it too useful.
I feel really defeated by suffering another relapse, especially when I was trying so hard to do everything right.  A big part of me just wants to give up because it feels impossible to defeat.  I wonder if there would be relief from not trying so hard to fight against something that maybe is just an inherent part of me.  I'm venting a little, but any thoughts or suggestions on what to do would be appreciated.

Bit of a random title but I guess it describes what I’m feeling pretty well. I feel like I’m in a never ending cycle of doctor’s appointments and blood tests and medication and therapy appointments where I don’t achieve anything. I always get the same terrible advice- exercise and socialise. I just wish people would realise the problem isn’t that I dont think exercise and socialising is important (I know it is), the problem is that I’m physically trapped in my bed and unable to get out. 
I shouldn’t have to fight this hard for healthcare. All I want is a GP I can trust, who listens to me and takes me seriously, a medication regimen that actually works and a clinical psych who can do their job. I really don’t think that’s a lot to ask!  I’m happy to put in the hard yards but I’m sick and tired of the healthcare system not meeting me halfway. I keep telling people nothing I’m doing is working and they just say to do it again! 
sorry for the rant. Anyone relate?

So a bit about me first;
I'm a 25y/o guy who is for the most part a recluse with few friends. I rarely drink, I smoke pot often and I've been dealing with varying levels of depression and anxiety for the past few years. I also have a gaming/porn addiction.
It's been almost 3 years now since my life got flip-turned upside down, but in truth I've been stagnant for closer to 5 and it's caused my life to come crashing down around me... I had it all at one point; a steady job, a proper family, normal routines, good finances and the most important to me, love. I look back on the choices I made with deep sorrow and regret. At the time I was an entitled, arrogant fool who thought the world and everyone in it owed me something, and everything would always be as I wanted it. Part of me knows I got what was coming to me, but knowing the error of my ways hasn't made it any easier dealing with and accepting the consequences (subsequent years of mental strife) that have followed.
tl;dr It started when I fell in love with a girl and we broke each others hearts, how cliche... We met online through gaming and pretty quickly fell for each other (LDR). I dropped out of uni and uprooted my life at 19 to move overseas until 2 years later when we moved home to Australia where we lived for a further 18 months until she lied, cheated and ran off with an acquaintance of ours (who she's still with today). During a lot of this time I was controlling, manipulative and mentally abusive, to an extent that I'll never forgive myself for some of the things I said and did to her. I kept my own insecurities about how others would perceive me and also my gaming/porn addictions under the rug while shifting the blame for all our problems almost entirely onto her throughout. She broke my heart, but only after I had hers.
 I feel useless. Since I've come home it's enabled me to basically go back to being a teenager and runaway from life and growing up. I live with my dad, I don't work or drive and I've got no ambition. I sit around playing video games all day, locked up in my bedroom like a cavetroll while life is just passing me by. The whole thing with my ex still dwells heavily on me and I just feel so alone all the time which feeds the addictions. I lost a lot more than a girlfriend 3 years ago and I'm still not coping. I haven't been intimate with anyone since either. I want to move on but feel trapped. What should I do? How do you motivate yourself when you've felt like this for so long?

I go to school everyday and come back to my parents saying I had an amazing day, when all I do is just sit there staring out the window. at the start of the year I was pretty happy I had a good group of friend in my class but there were a couple girls that bullied me the tiniest bit, but know they have nearly everyone against me but the people I still have are with their groups and their groups hate me so I have no one to hang out with. I feel like dying nearly every second and if I don't I just think would the world be any different without me there and my answers always no. I try to fit in and I try to be happy but I don't think I can do it anymore I need a friend, a true friend but I don't know who or how to find one. someone, anyone please help me any advice will help. but right now I'm drowning in my own tears and I can't get back up..

Hi all,
I was diagnosed with ASD nearly 2 years ago now, but the earliest I can remember coping with my depression using maladaptive daydreaming disorder is October 2013 when I was 12, and nothing's changed since. When I realised I wasn't supposed to feel empty for months at a time, I looked it up and told mum what keeps happening and 'this might be why' but she said I don't. Not any reasoning or anything, I just don't. She always denied it before I was diagnosed, but now has the excuse of using my ASD diagnosis as the reason of my 'not-depression'. Depression is tied in with ASD and anxiety disorders, and she accepts the extreme social anxiety, but she refuses to acknowledge the fact that I can't function like I'm supposed to, even with ASD. As far as I can tell the depression ruts are getting worse and I don't have any active support readily available.
I feel she might be using her experience with depression as a sort of comparison; I've never self-harmed or actively run away from home so surely I'm not depressed, right? I know that everyone experiences depression differently, it just makes me feel like I make it up whenever I get stuck in a rut for weeks or months at a time. It's certainly not helping that I never manage to catch a therapist appointment while I feel particularly bad, and so I can't accurately describe what's going on at the time.
Would it be a good idea to start a sort-of diary entry every time I can manage to write more than a few words so my therapist can more accurately see what's going on? I know mum won't accept a self-diagnosis, but I can't think of anything else that could help at the moment. I want to make sure I'm not making it up or exaggerating something else before I start my final year of high school.

Hi all,
I am a married man in my late 40's. For as long as I remember,  I've had low self esteem and self confidence. 
About 7 years ago I decided to change myself for the better. I read countless books and websites with the aim of achieving this and ,to be fair, my self confidence has improved.
However, I have had little joy in raising my self esteem. I joined a gym and have had good results in getting a good physique,  although the problem is despite being happy neck down,  it's neck up I don’t like. 
I have had comments at various stages in my life about how I look,  and it continues to affect me,  even at my age. I find myself comparing how I look to other men, and believe I am unattractive, and not good enough to women. 
This is reinforced by the fact that,  despite being married 20+ years, we have very little sex. I am convinced that although I believe my wife loves me, I don’t think she's ever been sexually attracted to me. 
I guess I'm wondering if anyone can relate to how I feel and has had any success in dealing with it.
Thanks in advance.

Hi, i'm new here and I wanted to seek help from others. when I was younger I was diagnosed with anxiety and I still have it now but no one really cares about that. since this year I noticed I might have depression, but it comes and goes. one week I will feel on top of the world, like I can achieve anything and have heaps of energy. the next week I will be super depressed and hate my life, I would cry a lot and not care about anything. Why do I have these mood swings? and does it mean I have depression or not? Thanks for reading. that's all.

Hi guys Im 25 /M 
i have been struggling the last 6-7 months, I constantly feel like I’m being judged by everyone,  constantly that no one needs me in this world I really need help and not sure what to do, I have talked to my partner about it but I think she’s in denial, I will randomly cry when certain things happen, like when there is love shown on a tv, song, movie I constantly feel like I have never been loved which is a strange feeling cause I know there’s someone that loves me but it still feels as if there is none in my life, and now im feeling like I’m getting thrown around in my own brain, I try to shake it and fight it but it stays in my head. It gets so frustrating you just want it to end, you want to find peace but it’s out of control. And it’s so hard to talk to people about it, cause no matter how much you explain it, all I end up getting is things will get better. Well 7 months on still nothings getting better, I’m falling into a slump, and I just need it to stop, I just want it to stop 😔

Hello everyone,
I have been struggling with depression for years and in recent months it has been at its worst and its best within a few minutes of each other sometimes. 
 
Everyday feels like an effort, nothing feels worth it, the world feels empty, I feel like I work for money that isn't even mine. I help all my friends and family and when they don't say thank you, it hurts so much. I feel like I am a part of people's lives but have no overall effect on anything. Life feels like it is going to fast and I keep stopping to catch my breath but everything keeps going without me, I feel so insignificant and small.
 
I love my girlfriend with all my heart, but sometimes she doesn't help me. She tells me in her way of information taking which is completely different to mine. She always wants help but then doesn't work with me. I don't want to get angry at her, because without her I wouldn't be alive.
 
I just need some tips as to what to do. I feel so out of place
 
I also take criticism so, so, so poorly and am one to cry over the smallest inconvenience. I also struggle with major self hatred and I do not see myself in a positive aspect at all.
 
Thank you for any reply

I'm baffled by the way people who know I have depression.  I was having a good day, the first for months.  I sent my daughter a message letting her know how happy I was.  Her response, ""Shut up, I'm busy!""  I sent a message to my son during a friendly chat about smoking hookah's.  I said to him, ""I'm going to see my psychologist, hope he doesn't mind me taking mine"".  His response, ""I dont want to know"".  Seems to me even loved ones could care less about depression and I wonder if anyone out there  has strategies for getting around this sort of thing.  Should I just cut myself away from them and break my heart, say something to them about depression which obviously they hate or simply carry on as if nothing has happened????

Hey team,

Bit of a different post to some of the once I've been seeing lately on the forum, but I'm here to inject some positivism in. For those who are unfamiliar with the world of professional boxing a man by the name of Tyson Fury fought the disputed heavy weigh champion of the world Deontay Wilder. Both men came into the fight undefeated, had an amazing fight and in a controversial decision they had a split decision draw (Fury definitely should have won.) What was special about this fight is Tyson Fury hasn't fought for two an a half years because of severe mental health issues, substance abuse and alcoholism. Despite being the former heavy weight champion on the world he fell into a pit of despair and attempted suicide. For a man to come back from such a dark time in his life and fight a 40-0 world champion, to arguably defeat his is an incredible feat. The most amazing part about it all is Fury is so very open about his battles and recovery. He's making such a profound effort to change the stigma around mental health and help people. His story resonates with me on such a personal level as a former professional athlete that went through a similar situation when I was on the top of my sport and I wanted to share it with you all.

I hope his story helps someone the same way it helped me.

Hi everyone,
I joined BB a few years ago, but haven’t been on here much at all! I struggle with anxiety/depression.  Most of the time I am unmedicated, Ive always felt worse medicated so tend to avoid it unless I get really low. I have a husband and two children 19 &17. Here are my current struggles.
JOB: I currently work full time in a job I HATE.  I started back at this job 2.5 years ago, I worked there previously, so knew I was going going to hate it, but my  job at the time was finishing and we couldn’t afford for me to be unemployed so I took it. I decided a few mths ago to start looking for something else. I have applied for so many jobs that I’m qualified for, but just can’t seem to land one.  As you can imagine this constant rejection is not good. It’s so hard to keep getting back up and then rejected.
FAMILY: My husband doesn’t know how much I struggle with my depression/anxiety. Previous times I have involved him he does the let’s get this fixed which we go off to the doctor etc and then he never brings it up again. His mother suffered badly with mental health problems so I think his way of coping is to ignore it, until he has no choice but to get involved. So my way of dealing with his non involvement is to suffer on my own. But safe to say I feel so alone in our marriage/family life.
FRIENDS: We have a close group of friends, but I constantly feel like the one left out (typing this feels like I should still be 16 & back in school)!! I feel like the only reason I am with them is because everyone likes my husband. He is such an extrovert and fun to be around. None of our friends know about my depression/anxiety, because I don’t feel close enough to talk about it with any of them.
I have hit a major cross road, I feel like I would have a better chance of being happier & managing the anxiety/depression if i was on my own, that way I can avoid a lot of the situations that make my anxiety worse (ie:social events where I feel unwanted, family who I can’t talk to etc). I find the hardest part is feeling alone surrounded by so many people. But then I’m concerned that totally isolating myself cannot be good for anyone? At this point there is not one area of my life that feels good/right. I cry every Sunday night starting a new week and the worst day of the year for me is coming around “New Years” that feeling of how am I going to get through another year!!

I think I have depression. It hasn't been diagnosed yet though. And I was just wondering if there are any places where a fourteen-year-old can go get it diagnosed without their parent's knowledge. I will, of course, tell my mom that I have depression if it is diagnosed but I don't want to cause my mom any stress and then not end up having depression. So if anyone knows what I can do, please reply. Thanks xx

I am struggling with an overwhelming feeling of guilt. I feel sad for my husband for having a wife with mental struggles, and I feel sorry for my baby girl that she has me as her mum. Today I also got dates mixed up for a new friend’s birthday celebrations so I missed the party and feel so awful. I am always in a state of feeling like a pain/nuisance/burden/inadequate. 
Are there any other people out there who feel this same way regularly? What steps to you take to feel differently? I’m currently seeing a psych every two weeks but when I experience bad periods in between, it’s hard to cope.

Hi Everyone,
I was interested to see if anyone else could relate to this.
I've been a smoker since I was 16 and I have tried everything to quit over the years with no success.
I have come to the conclusion that in part I am using this to self medicate for my depression/anxiety.  My entire adult life I have had only one coping strategy for stress - smoke a cigarette.
You could almost say that cigarettes are similar to a security blanket for me.  I feel like if I was to face stress without them I would crumble to dust and be blown away.
I was wondering if anyone felt this way or perhaps did in the past and was able to change.
I look forward to hearing you feedback.
Jen

hey.. sorry but uhm im not in a great state of mind right now. sorry if i posted this in the wrong thread or whatever..
i graduated high school. it's been like two months ever since then.

i feel like im wasting my life away. i want to do something that genuinely makes me happy.. but nothing makes me happy really besides talking to my online best friend who is ages away. my online best friend is the only one who listens. im just tired.. of everything. im tired of the way i am. i hate myself for being an introvert. i hate myself for not being able to draw correctly. i hate myself for not getting into university. i hate myself because no one wants to hire a depressed, sad, pathetic 18 year old girl in a country town.

im tired of not being good enough. im tired of never being the first priority. i bother everyone and i hate myself so much. im just tired. i feel numb all the time. why cant people get excited when they see me? why am i always the one who is excluded, left out, behind.. i just want to give up.

i've given up on trying to get happier. ive tried therapy it doesnt work. medication doesnt work, my doctor wont let me go on a higher dose. im also 18, and female if that helps. i just.. dont see the purpose of me being alive. im just a waste of space. im tired of everything, yknow? my mum doesnt bother to understand me, even though ive explained thousands of times. she just doesn't get it.

ive had depression ever since i was a child. i never ever thought i was going to live to the age i am now. so now i feel like im wasting my life away. i dont expect to grow up older. i dont see myself living. i never did. and this.. girls.. voice in my head wont go. this girl's voice is the voice of my ex best friend. she bullied me, made me insecure, and she knew i would cling to her because she was the only one i knew. i keep hearing voices in my head from my depression and anxiety.. yelling i need to stop being so goddamn lazy but i just cant be bothered. i just..

im giving up. someone please help me before i lose myself.

In May this year I had bariatric surgery as I was morbidly obese (sleeve gastrectomy), and since this time my depression has worsened and I'm currently in the midst of a major depressive episode. I'm wondering if there are any other BB forum participants who have similarly had bariatric surgery and also find themselves in a similar situation? 
I’ve been doing a lot of reading about
depression following sleeve gastrectomy surgery, in the hopes that I will
discern why it has happened to me.  

Most scientific/academic articles say that
depression and other psychological conditions are more prevalent in bariatric
surgery patients than they are in the general population. This is ascribed to
the physical and psychological impact that obesity has on patients’ lives. The
articles claim that bariatric surgery has a positive affect on patients’ lives
given the health benefits of surgery and the boost to self-esteem that comes
with being thinner. However, some studies have shown that a small number of
bariatric patients have a psychological downturn following surgery, and one
study has found that the likelihood of attempted suicide is 4-5 times higher in
bariatric patients than it is in the general population. These articles make
the case that this psychological downturn is the result of patients not being
able to eat as much as they are used to, and/or patients turning to alcohol and
substance abuse to manage their emotions following surgery, and/or patients
having unrealistic expectations of the benefits of bariatric surgery. What
seems to be absent though, to my mind, is analysis of the physical impact of bariatric
surgery on brain chemistry. 

Now, I am not a chemist, am not a
scientist, so I cannot wait until further research is conducted into this
issue. My pressing need is to dig myself out of the hole that I’m in. Or grab a
ladder and start climbing. 
Is there anyone else here in a similar situation?

I don't know if anyone can help me or give me advice, I just needed to get this off my chest.
This is
where im at. Long story
short, my depression is back, which would explain why I have been so distant,
quiet, grumpy all of the time lately. It’s been building these last few months
and it’s reached a tipping point. I have been
crying at random points throughout the days and most nights. Im not happy in
just about everything in my life, I eat more than I used to, I get hardly any
sleep which isn’t helping as im up all night thinking about this. I know what’s
causing it but im too afraid to speak about it as it means my family will be
ruined for good.

Ive been
married for 7 years now, I love my wife, but not in the way she loves me. She is
a wonderful person and a great mother but I just don’t feel anything for her
anymore, not the way I should anyway. That 2
years we spent apart ruined it for us, me working in the city while she lived
in the country with her family. The travel alone was a killer but the distance
put a wedge there that’s just grown each week ever since. Sad isn’t it, took me
two years to really miss her and my two kids to make them move back with me. My wife and
I have nothing in common, the only thing I feel we have in
common is we are married, have two kids and share a bed. I love her but I don’t love her. I love her like a friend and
that’s not how a couple should be. 

Im at that
point with this depression that I have zero patience for
my two kids. I know it’s
cruel to think and feel like this, but that’s where im at. I want my wife to
take our kids and go back to her parents in the country. I want them to stay
there and enjoy there life in the country once again. 
I never wanted to be a father, it hurts to say that but
that’s just how ive always felt.  I
don’t regret it one bit as I love them so much. What father falls out of love with his kids.  I never wanted
to get married, I don’t want to be a husband anymore as I feel nothing for her anymore.
How the hell do I tell her this as it will crush her the instant I
start talking. Whenever im
with them I just want them to go away and leave me alone. I need to be alone or else im going to go crazy or
snap or both. Im always yelling at them
for nothing as my
guilt and shame for feeling this way is making me push them away even further. 

Some nights I don’t want to come home from work. I just wanna stay in the
car and shout and scream at myself. How do I
tell them. How do I
tell my wife.

Hello, I've read quite a few posts on this forum and finally decided to make my own. 
I'm not really sure how to start this so why not here? I've struggled with depression and social anxiety for over 3 years now. I've seen therapists for about a year and a half which have helped make things more bearable but, I still feel terrible mentally every day and it's been getting worse over the past months. I'm onto my fourth antidepressant now with little hope for the current one. Over the past few weeks, I've added onto this with nearly constant gender dysphoria. 
I've tried to do new things like writing, photography, competitive games and hanging out with friends- nothing really interests me anymore though. I barely leave the house anymore and do very little with my time which I can't imagine helps. I'm enrolled for uni next year to do an interesting course but I can't seem to care at all. 

I don't see the point in going on like this or how to get past this, I've beaten self-harm and suicidal urges in the past which I barely think about now. The only reason that I haven't killed myself in the past is that I still have hope for the future and don't want to waste a chance or devastate my family. I have lovely people around me but I still feel incredibly alone.  
I'm not sure what I think will happen by posting here but it can't hurt to try.

Hello there, 
This is a first for me posting in one of these forums, but I guess I've been feeling like this for a while now. I had 2 sessions with a psychologist a few years ago and they sort of helped but i just feel like why would someone want to listen to all my drama and i stopped going, i changed around my life and my job but still am feeling unhappy and I don't know what to do. Is happiness something that is found or will I ever feel it because right now it doesnt feel like it. ive been with my partner for 7 years and i dont think i love him anymore, but what if i walk away and never find someone who wants to be with me. 
How does one figure out who they are and where they want to be in life with no understanding how to get there?

Hi everyone,
I’m 22 and currently going through a dark time, the worst part is my life is lovely. I have a great boyfriend and family and friends who love me, but the problem is I feel being at work makes me so anxious, unmotivated and depressed. 
It’s past the point of just feeling shit at work, it’s really impacting me day to day and has for a while. I feel overwhelmed all the time and feel like I don’t have time to take care of myself. It’s been this way since I started working at 14 and gotten progressively worse. 
Has anyone had experience with Centrelink or know what process I would have to go through to be at least recognised as someone who may need support? I don’t expect to not work and get a disability pension, but if there is something like being able to work part time and given a small allowance additionally?
Would really appreciate any help

Love My Life By Robbie Williams
Tether your soul to me
I will never let go completely
One day your hands will be
Strong enough to hold me
I might not be there for all your battles
But you'll win them eventually
I'll pray that I'm giving you all that matters
So one day you'll say to me
I love my life
I am powerful
I am beautiful
I am free
I love my life
I am wonderful
I am magical
I am me
I love my life
I am not my mistakes
And God knows I've made a few
I started to question the angels
And the answer they gave was you
I cannot promise there won't be sadness
I wish I could take it from you
But you'll find the courage to face the madness
And sing it because it's true
I love my life
I am powerful
I am beautiful
I am free
I love my life
I am wonderful
I am magical
I am me
I love…
Find the others
With hearts
Like yours
Run far, run free
I'm with you
I love my life
I am powerful
I am beautiful
I am free
I love my life
I am wonderful
I am magical
I am me
I love my life
I am powerful
I am beautiful
I am free
I love my life
I am wonderful
I am magical
I am me
I love my life
And finally
I'm where I wanna be

Hi,
I hope that within these pages there may be people like me; others who understand the tumultuous confusion of life or the haphazard attempts at living.
Do you know who you are? I don't.
Do you jump when a stranger stares at you from a mirror? I do.
Are you everything and anything and at the same time nothing?
Is life a pure charge of emotion, followed by emotion then yet more emotion? A train wreck. A mangled mess of anxiety, depression, identity distortion, hyper vigilance, paranoia, ideations, plans and isolation?
Do you hide from the world afraid of your illness unsure where the boundary of person and mental health issue is? Do you fear yourself? Have you learned to trust nothing and no-one including you? 
Can you see yourself always being alone because you believe you stuff everything up and are incapable of a relationship? Do you push everyone away so as not to be hurt any more or to hurt others?
I am BPD and C-PTSD and live in isolation in a rural community.  Re-reading this I have done it again - described myself as my disorders as though they are all that I am.
I am unsure if there is a road to happiness and a fulfilling life but I am trying to find one.

Hi guys, this is really hard to explain but I’m going to be trying my best. When i think about myself, i sort of struggle to view myself as a person if that makes sense? It’s like I’ve gone through so much that my brain just shut off the self awareness aspect. I don’t know if I’ve explained that right. It also has an affect on relationships that i try to have. I cannot fathom why anyone would have feelings for me, not just because i have low self worth but because it just doesn’t compute in my head. I struggle to show my family affection although i am getting better at that

Hi all,
About 6 weeks ago, I came off an antidepressant which I was on for anxiety. Now I am 6-weeks into being on no medication, I feel like my anxiety is okay (except for my excessive worrying!) and I feel more depressed I think? Is this normal? 
Should I maybe wait a few weeks to see if my mood lifts before starting a new anti-depressant? I didnt like my other one because of side effects and I have actually even brought the new one but I am reluctant to start it. 
I fee like my mood is very low, I am avoiding work, I feel feeling guilty about not going to work, I am worrying about anything, and I feel like I am avoiding all positive ways of coping (never consistent with professional help, always cancel appointments at the last minute, I like yoga but never go for some reason). I am also feeling anti social and the only person I want to see is my boyfriend and no one else. I also hate my job.
Sorry I am now rambling but I hope someone can comment on this :)

Please help me.  I suffer from major depressive disorder.  I've been on the maximum dose of my anti depressant for many years now and it's at the point of no longer coming close to helping me.  I have a referral to see a psychiatrist but they don't make urgent appointments and he is away sick and they can't event give me an ETA on an appointment.  I feel this is URGENT.  I am NOT coping with my life at all.  I don't want to kill myself, but I simply can't go on like this any longer.  Is there a way to get the help I need?

Hello Beyond Blue world!
I have come here to talk to others that may be experiencing postnatal depression. I am currently pregnant with my 2nd child and my first is 2.5 years old. I know that I had some depression with my 1st child but never sought any help. There is a lot of information and resources for 1st time parents about this topic however, this time round, the depression is different and not so focused on my pregnancy or being a parent. It's a bunch of things like not working and being worried about getting back into the workforce eventually, a decision of moving back to Australia from the US as I wasn't coping well with being a Mum, the worry of certain emotions returning once I have this second baby...writing it out doesn't seem like much of a problem...so maybe I'm overreacting and it's just the pregnancy causing doubt? 
Anyway, love to hear from anyone else who may be dealing with PND or is just struggling with life as a stay-at-home-Mum. 
Thanks!

Hi everyone,
im new and I don’t mean to get too comfy straight away but I’m dying to get some things off of my chest.
i am hanging by a thread. I don’t feel like I’m cut out for life. I have so many wonderful things, I’m just not one of them. People like me aren’t allowed to be happy. Every single thing is a struggle. I’m always the odd one out. Always. I give and I give and I love and I love but I’m no ones favourite. No one’s go to. Hell, even my best friend since childhood barely speaks to me since I got married. I have the most wonderful husband, but I’m a crap wife. I’m a crap person. No matter how hard I try. There’s always something new and terrible waiting around the corner. Sometimes I could just scream and scream until there is no breath left. I feel alone and cold. I have seen so many different therapists, shirnks, you name it.  O one can change what I am. My lot on life will never change. Why fight it? I’m always forgotten. Always overlooked. Nothing I say or do is ever right. I hate it. I hate myself so so much people have no clue.

Hi
new here
I’m wanting to start a family or at least I think I am. 
I have anxiety/depression diagnosed 9 years ago and have had treatment and medication since then. 
My concern is my medication and pregnancy. Just saw a psychiatrist who said it’s best to stay in medication as it’s better for me to be stable than stressed while pregnant.  I feel I will still be stressed about being on medication.
My thoughts are running wild with it all  
Would love others experience on all this.

It’s been 4 years since my last post. I gess why I am righting again is because last time I found some relief in getting my thoughts down and out. It’s a strange old life that I live I really feel at eezs talking to a complete strangers yet I am unable to approach a family member or friend. I am a 38 year old man been living with anxiety and depression as long as I can remember While my anxiety now seems some what under control my depression comes and goes like the wind. 
It’s be a particularly hard year for me more so much than any other. At the start of the year I lost a friend and family member to suicide and am still to this day trying to deal with this his loss. Anyone that I would have consider as a close friend has all but disappeared form my life it’s been more than 2 year since I last visited a friend more than a year since I have spoken to one of my friends on the phone. If someone was to ask me today if I had any friends I would reply as “no I don’t” and on top of all this my job that I do actually in joy and take grate satisfaction form has been a roller coaster ride with many changes this year both good and bad. 
For the last few months I could probably say I have been Doing ok considering.
so last week end I decided to go out for the first time in a long time a night out and have a few drinks at a local clubs (nothing of considering level just a few drinks)and there as it just so happened I met a beautiful young girl and had what I would describe as “one of the best nights of my life” the first time I can say that I really had a good time and enjoy myself all year. But it was not to last. I have been on a high all week long smiling and even at times giggling to myself. 
Now same day one week later I have crashed hard into a equal all time low, it’s hard for me now just to see what I am typing as tears stream down my face...  
i know with experience in depression I will slowly climb back up but it’sa long long climb that seems to get harder every time.
so I gess what I mean to say or thoughts form this is that I am always worry about the next time I might have a good time or simply feel good because I know the drop is just around the corner time and time again just when I feel I am getting over my depression I seem to just simply tip over the top I can’t deal with my emotions and thoughts my past always haunts my future.

I'm in hospital at the moment,  after surgery and infection on both feet, I've been here for nearly 2 weeks now and don't know how much longer it will take. I know that I'm where i need to be, but as each day passes my depression and anxiety increases. I feel powerless to know what to do, i don't think there is anything else they can do either! Any ideas would be welcome,  thanks,xx

I have had a lot of stressful events at work, home and broader family this year which has meant lots of work to do.  I am at a stage where I am completely exhausted and dont want to deal with another thing. I find it very hard to muster any enthusiasm for anything.  I wondering how related and/or different burn-out and depression are. Are the strategies the same for dealing with them? For some reason I would feel better if I was burnt-out rather than depressed.

I have had depression for 8 years on and off and I am 21 years old, only last year I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and I have been off medication since Christmas. I dropped out of my degree, moved back home and now I work full time. I have come to think I will never be really happy again. The strangest thing is that I am okay with that, I wake up angry, frustrated and down right miserable buts its been so long that its just another day for me, I don't expect anyone to understand it. But its who I am now. In public and at work, I put on the mask, I smile, socialise and I am a very polite person to most people. Some afternoons  I go to gym for an hour (5 times a week) I get home, make dinner, eat, go to my room I try to go to sleep its hard for me to sleep but eventually I do. Its just another day tomorrow I tell myself. I eat healthy I exercise often, but at the end of every day I struggle to keep myself from screaming and crying. Is it just who I am? I have no idea but its my life now. I will always be a sad man.

Hi everyone 
I never thought I’d be here posting but here I am. I’m a 26 year old female who has generally always been a happy person. I’ve started feeling the struggles of life over the past 12 months. Started when I hit 25, instantly negative thoughts of 25 and have no partner which makes me think no kids then no future. I’m sick of hearing “you’re still so young” from people who are married starring their own families. I’m last of my friends to get married and I feel like I’ve lost a lot of friends ships due to this coming of age. 
I currently work in childcare which I dread I absolutely loathe getting up every morning, it’s so stressful for the income I receive, I still live with my parents because I cannot afford to move out. I recently started this job at a new centre hoping to get a new insight of the industry and this isn’t the case. I feel so stuck in my life and I am not happy, I’m always snappy, I don’t get enjoyment out of anything anymore I feel like my friends all have what I want and it kills me seeing them being so happy while I’m here feeling alone and isolated thinking I’ll never have a family of my own.
I want a new career but I have no experience in anything else and at this time of the year it’s hard to find a full time job, I’m really just looking for someone who has been in this situation and can give me some insight of why I’m feeling this way, I have no enjoyment for life anymore and no fear of consequences.
please help me

Hi,
Haven't had the best of weeks and it lately feels this is all my life is. Had a cold recently and after visiting my GP i don't feel any better, was prescribed antibiotics and i don't feel that better a week later. the other reason i went was to speak about talking to a counselor or someone to talk to. Been feeling depressed and more than anything just sad. i'm not in a place in life i want to be - unemployed at 31 and just not feeling happy in life. I understand it's a natural feeling to be depressed about not working but this feels different. making it worse is knowing Christmas is weeks away and the likely reality is that i won't be working before the year is out. I'm tired of the endless cycle of applying for work i'll never get, feeling depressed about not working and just feeling sad. 
I'm trying to help myself by starting to do exercise, eating better and having a positive attitude - it's easier said than done though. I'm still waiting to hear back from the counselor i called so hopefully once i have a chat that may help me. I'm just over feeling sad and depressed

I was at work when the foreman drove in too fast after forgetting he'd had me get the apprentices to wash the painted garage floor with degreaser. He used his 4wd and my legs to break the tyre of car I was working on from the rim of wheel. My wife was at home cleaning up the house for sale as we'd purchased a new one up bush. A good way to escape the '89 interest rate of 23%.
Wife had to drive 50km to visit me after busting gut working while pregnant and looking after two toddlers. This made me particularly popular and began to appear to her like I was away on holidays while she did all the work.
A couple of my mates and me in plaster up to the groin took our worldly possessions to the new place, wife and kids moved up while I went back on holiday in rehab hospital. The day I was to be released the surgeons took a look, said bone graft. Sent me to another hospital, it was loose ligaments; sent me off to catch up with wife and kids in absolute agony. 'sign of weakness???'
Most of the hillbillies in the town thought so and I suffered, took loads of crap to try to deal with pain and got depressed. When I got out of psychiatric hospital where I had been diagnosed with hep C, no doubt in my mind a result of the operations on my legs. The townsfolk with open friendly arms banned me from all eating, food and drink places. Kindly offering to let me drink stubbies only; in the bar which cleared when I tried.
Ran home to mum, forgot she'd paid out a mortgage I had cos I was so screwed up and lost my 5 acres of land in that horrid town. The lands now worth close to $500,000 but banks only have to keep records for 7 years, I'm screwed. Now friction with Mum over the land, wife divorced me cos scared of hep C. She didn't notice she hadn't picked it up off me in 22yrs marriage. And that is how I got depressed.
Is it an illness?? It is when all the stuff ups go around and around like a CD jumping from one track to another with no solutions. We know we aren't weak. Some think we want to have some quack fry our brains with electricity, we know its cos we're desperate to get rid of the CD, most people think we're forced to do it as punishment for being messed up. I won't let them do it to me, though I'm tempted at times. Best method to shut up the CD was by letting it all out in the mainstream, not bottling it up; HAPPY FOR FIRST TIME IN MONTHS, Thanks so much to the wise psychologist I didn't even notice him tell me. WOW!!!

Hi
I would like to ask if anyone has experienced feeling as if in a daze a lot? I am on medication and have been for the past 2 years. I tend to forget things such as one time I left a saucepan on the stove top, left pumpkin boiling far too long; or having a conversation with a friend then sometime later I don't remember specific things we talked about; feel like as if I am in a daze a lot. I tried to explain to my GP but she wants to upped the dosage which I think it'll make things worse. I don't process well nor grasp things as normal people do. Is it the medication or me?

Hi My name is Emily. I had my depression episode in 2015. It is now 2018 and it's been almost 3 years since my last episode. My fear of relapsing is eating away at me :

Everyday is rooted in control. If I'm in control I won't relapse. 
 
 
I watched over my tv limit today, it is racking me with paranoia. It makes me physically sick to think I could relapse into depression . I shouldn't have watched more than my limit but always being in control it's exhausting #Phobia
I am just so terrified, if I relax, even for just a few hours, I'll relapse. 
 
I am over being afraid, I just want to live life without being controlled by this fear

The last 5+ years I’ve been stripped of everything material and maternal that keep my alive an functioning. Now I’m a skeleton of emotion, bent twisted and very untrusting of all, I’ve worked so hard to hold on to what’s left of my life, I’m sure there is more for me to enjoy, My specialist has prescribed medication, not a direction I’m keen to follow, I have no support and my only friends are those I work with (don’t really want to share to much with them) so so many questions and I know I’m not alone but I sure feel like the only person alive. ????

So after having been depressed for ages, questioning my diagnosis as I’ve been eluded of high episodes for so long; here she finally is! The long awaited upside!
I don’t generally get euphoric highs, usually more the irritable ones with a pang of euphoria throw in. This one is different, I’m high as a kite with a pang of irritability thrown in. This mostly when my husband doesn’t understand that I’m on a mission and stands in my way.
I’ve been up since 1:30 and it’s been a ball. Dancing around the living room to my favourite songs. The house is sparkling. I cleaned everything from my spice bottles to my mop, not cleaning *with* the mop but actually giving the mop a scrub down with gumption. Beautiful outcome I might add. All those task that I didn’t do for 6 months; consider them done!
Fair enough my husband’s breathing is annoying me, he’s been under clear instructions not to touch me, and the outside world seems a bother but I feel like a million bucks.
I feel sexually invigorated (but not with my husband as he does everything wrong), I feel light and free and not unimportant anxiety-less.
My husband came out at 4:00 being a Debby Downer saying I need to see my psych.
I do like my psych but I know he’ll also be a buzz kill. Here, have some pills to make you feel less good. “Sure I’ll have them” - said no one ever.
I do know I need to see him but also feel entitled to have this brief respite. I’m still functioning, perhaps bit hyperactive but nothing more than that.
There is an emerging school of thought amongst progressive psychiatrists not to medicate hypomania. Their oath is not to do any harm after all. A little hypomania has never hurt anyone, if anything it bettered them.
I’m still taking my meds as described so you can’t fault me for that, however, my main med is an anticonvulsant (which name I can’t mention due to community rules) that is known for curbing the lows but not so much the highs, you in the know will know.
I’ve quit my job and fear that will send my psych into medical analysis overdrive about my state. I personally think it was a long time coming with me having to take stress leave twice in only a few months.
Would it be possible at all to ride out the high and rely on my meds to offer protection against the low? It’s been brilliant in doing that thus far so I don’t see why not now?
I would really just like to enjoy the brief respite from months of stress, dance around my living room like no one is watching and, you know, enjoy life.

I used to have the broken record going around and around in my head jumping tracks from one stuff up to the next.  It was ENDLESS!!  I found that if I wrote everything down so I only had to remember WHERE the mistakes and broken dreams were, as opposed to WHAT the pointless self destructive stuff was.  I could sleep peacefully and no longer needed the record playing.  Its been working for me for a while, I do hope this method works for you.

suffocating avolition is giving me severe anxiety bc of things I'm not doing/starting/finishing/the effort of studying seemed so great I dropped out of uni/I barely exist most days. seemingly, though, I don't feel enough anxiety to shake off my apathetic existence.

I can't enjoy hobbies or fun things bc of the anxiety that comes from knowing I'm not doing the things I need to do. I can't commit to long time-consuming hobbies (reading a book, playing a long story driven videogame, watching a multi-season tv show) bc I'm afraid of tunnel vision, of becoming so lost in it, I forget about anything else. it's moronic to fear this when even without committing to these time-consuming hobbies, I still can't find the energy to do anything I'm supposed to do. eventually, I feel that I lose interest in my hobbies, bc even contemplating one while struggling with the resulting anxiety feels like more effort than I have within me to give.
I'm in an endless loop of: having things I need to do > not being able to do things I need to do > not being able to do things I want to do instead > feeling anxious and helpless over this personal failing > resorting to aimless low effort activities if not just sleeping.

this seemingly endless struggle is sucking any joy from my life. I've felt shades of this on and off for several years (I'm 25 now) but it's been exponentially worse in the last 6 months. and this loop is accompanied, of course, by my ever faithful inability to feel content for any measure of time that isn't fleeting. a shortcoming I've felt since I was 15.

the only thing I actively manage to force myself to do, is to go to work. I can't even begin to fathom the repercussions of losing my job so it's the only fear strong enough to get me to do something I need to do. but even then, I'm making good use of my ""sick leave"" and liberty to ""work from home"". I'm lucky to be on time 2 out of the 5 days of the week, if I even manage a 5 day attendance record.

growing up, I was told that mental health isn't real, that any issues you have are consequences of your actions, that everyone feels ""sad"" or ""anxious"", you just get over it. I'm struggling to come to terms with the fact that maybe I need professional help, maybe medication. I feel anxious even thinking of how I would have to hide this from my family out of shame. I don't even know whether to see a counselor or a psychologist or a psychiatrist. what even is the difference? who will help me, please...

Hi all, I'm new to BeyondBlue and the whole concept of forums and threads, but need some help to make positive change.
My depression, and unwillingness to act on, or face consequences of my actions/inactions has broken down my relationship with the most amazing and supportive woman whom I love so much.
I'm not the person she met and fell in love with 10 years ago. I've changed, I'm not sure if this is my environment, depression sneaking in or what. I have mild to moderate depression, and am also identifying other behaviours I'd like to kick.
I have made so many plans and promises to her that I just don't come through with, sometimes it's just too hard, or I had the idea now it's her turn to make it happen. She is a most caring and supportive person, this is really not about her, it's about me acknowledging I have depression, and working out how to live with it. I am seeing a psychologist whose helping me to work out where I'm at, and where I want to be, so that's a start.
Approval seeking, is a behaviour I noticed recently when I started working in a new place, doing the same job i've done for years. I had to tell myself it didn't matter what the other guys thought of me, just do your job to the best of your ability. This need to ""fit in"" drove me to tears on more than one occasion. I think I've been doing this in our relationship also, not saying or suggesting anything in case they where wrong, or silly ideas or what I don't know. This behaviour naturaly led to my partner making all the decisions which has been exhausting for her, and addmitantly no good for me either kind of subconsiesly contributing to my deppression. I think I've got over the work thing, and am trying to be more decisive with my partner as this is so much more important.
This seems a really disjointed, however that's been my thinking of late, can't really settle on one thing.
Essentially I need help, & advice how to accept that I have deppression, deal with it, make changes, and build a relationship where i am the partner she really deserves, not one she has to look after.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated

At the moment I am a complete mess. I have an endless cycle of depression and it feels like it’ll never end.  It started in 2015 when I had been really sick and every time I think of that year I’m scared it’ll one day all repeat itself.  My friend group in school isn’t doing so well and I’m not coping at all.  My mum wouldn’t support me in getting help and I really have no way out eccept seeing a school councillor which I haven’ done.  I’m only at the age of 14 and I’m really feeling like giving up especially since I have no support and I’m losing interest in activities I enjoy.

You're all warriors in my eyes and excuse me if this rant seems cynical. I have no solutions, i just want to share. 
There are a few mantra's in the status quo you might all be familiar with such as ""Fake it till you make it"" or ""Human's are gregarious by nature"" the first one is easy to refute as complete horse dung but the second isn't quiet so simple. 
Lets start with Fake it till you make it shall we, so you want that new job, you dress well, you boost your resume, you say the right things during the interview in order to give away the right impression, it could be the complete opposite of who you are as a person but in order to land that job you must play the game. You're encouraged to be someone you're not right from the start. It all makes sense really after all we do have an entire industry based on deception, emotional manipulation called acting and these people are payed very well to lure you into a place of living vicariously through the eyes of another person, movies. Blindly following celebrity culture and actually emulating what these people do on the screen in our own real lives, kind of morbidly twisted. This Keynesian model only has one thing on it's mind. Increase GDP, pay no mind to anything else. 
 
Then we have the notion that humans are by nature gregarious, oh really? It's statistically an improbability for this to be true. I can honestly say that I'm more calm and more myself when as far away from people as humanly possible. It may seem a little misanthropic but it's true, I'm an introverted lone wolf who does not seem to enjoy the company of others, yet here i am posting and trying to ""reach out"", but it's more in protest rather than looking for some form of companionship. 
I look at what we are today, we wake up, fake up, we lie, we cheat, we're opportunistic, some play the game rather well actually, i call them covert chameleons and others just sit back and say ""hang on something is not right here"" is this the best we could do? Nations, Religious fables, Keynesian economics focused on consumption and spending rather than efficiency and value! Sure It has made us a more advanced people, but on aggregate worse people. I'm not some anti-capitalism thumper since it has done amazing things for our quality of life, but it does seem that today more than ever the things you own, end up owning you. 
I'm a depressed wreck, I'm cynical but I'm not mad, not yet anyway. I don't like people, yet i still love you all. Go figure that one out.

Hi all
im reaching out to see if anyone has experienced anything similar to me.
 
ive struggled with what can only be described as bipolar depression since I was 15. I'm now 35 so 20 years. I've never sought help of any kind.
 
I had 3 great years in the top end a few years back when I was completely depression free and thought I'd finally beaten it.
 
the last few years since I moved south however have been the worst of my life. I've had frequent breakdowns and suicidal thoughts. It's been really really bad. It's crippled my life.
 
Ive realised in the past few months (and have suspected the same in the past but forgot about it when I was depression free) that my down episodes are related to blood sugar crashes. 
 
I have a very clean diet and do a lot of sport. I'm an ex competitive swimmer. I could never do the same amount of training the other kids could seemingly do with no problems when I was younger. My mood swings were horrific. My theory is I have a very fast metabolism. i don't think I have anything physically wrong as the 3 depression free years I had were as a result of living in a hot climate. Lower energy demands, no blood sugar crashes, stable mood. 
 
recently my mental health has been horrendously bad so after realising this I've taken steps to do less exercise and eat more sugar. This is having great results stabilising my mood but is a challenge to pretty much constantly eat + eat stuff I don't like (eg soft drinks etc)
I don't know if this sounds all a bit strange especially to those who have other forms of clinical depression but 100% this has been a lifelong struggle for me as I dont realise I'm crashing till it happens then get lost in the depression and can't see a way out. It's very scary,
 
so is anyone out there who has experienced anything similar??please reply and let me know how you coped and if in fact you got diagnosed with something. For my part I'm planning on moving back up north it's the best solution for me.

Hi there.
I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. Even as a child I can recall that something just didn’t seem quite right about me. 
Lately though, due to stress at work, at home and with family, I’m feeling the urge to run away or do something more serious. It’s not that I don’t want to be here, but I can’t handle the pressure anymore. It’s an unbearable weight on my shoulders and I constantly feel like I’m drowning.
I take antidepressants but they haven’t made much of a difference, and when I try and talk to people they either dismiss me or don’t quite grasp how serious my situation is. 
Has anybody else felt this way? If so, did it get any better for you? I’m really stuck and I have no idea what to do.

Hello all, 
After symptoms of depression for close to a year, I made the decision to go on anti-depressants. Because i was sick my University transcript is a mess and I'm staying at uni an extra year to finish my degree. Everytime i feel like im making progress i feel as though i just get smashed down again and im back at the start. I'm trying to improve on uni from semester to semester and i feel as though i am, but that doesnt really reflect well on the transcipt. I guess i feel like me being sick now is going to hugely effect my getting a job when i finish uni. 
I used to be so committed and focused on the future, i feel like a different person.  I just want to get better.

Is it normal to want to disappear? I don't want to die, I just want to restart my life and disappear. I have such a great life compared to some people I know, but we always want what we don't have. I have messed up everything in the past, and I want to reset my life. I know a lot of people just go 'oh the past is the past you'll get over it.', but I care about every action I do, what people might think of me, what my friends might think of me, what my family might think of me. I'm very self conscience about what everyone thinks of me. I've tried getting help, but every ""compliment"", I believe is a lie. They say "" you're such a great artist!"", but compared to everyone else's, my art is bad. They say, ""you look nice today"", but I think the school told everyone to be nice to me because I was seeing the school counsellor about my depression and anxiety. I believe the school I go to wants me to have a label, so I can be explained for my weird behaviour and me sitting by myself all the time. I don't want a label, but I want the school to leave me alone.

I am a 17 old, and 3/4 of the way through my year 12 exams.
I have been on a specific medication for around 4 months (but I’ve been on medication for 2 years in total trying to see what works and what doesn’t). On medication, my mood is stable and I feel happy most of the time, but I’m quiet and can’t act like myself in social situations.
Recently, the doctor doesn’t know, but I stopped taking my medication (it’s been about 3 days since I’ve taken it), and I can express myself more and am more engaged in social activities than when I was on the medication, but I’m starting to get down again.
Im just wondering, would it be more beneficial to stay off my medication do I can be more myself (but feel down), OR should I go back on my medication and be happier most of the time (but not able to engage in social activity or interact with people efficiently).
im lost and I’m not sure what to do.

I am overwhelmed with it all. My job, emotions and my life.
A bit of background on me and where I am at. I have been dealing with with anxiety my whole life and depression for 6ish years. I was struggling to get to school most of the time in my early teens so I finished early and am currently 17 and working casually. 
I dont know if I can keep doing what I am doing. I work 3 full days a week, out of the house another 2 and it is overwhelming me. Over the past 6 years I have sat at home most of the time and done nothing so I am finding this sudden 'life' too much. I am getting really depressed, having panic attacks and melting down when I am not at work. I feel like everything is moving too fast and I can't handle it. I can't catch my breath and relax because tomorrow I have work and its just a continuous stress that brings me down. 
My job isn't reliable either. It can be any 3 days at anytime of the week which means I can't get used to a routine or settle into a pattern. I am usually in bed by 9pm but I get shifts which are till 9:15 meaning I dont get into bed until 11 so I bet you can imagine how disruptive that is.
I can't talk to anyone in my life about it all because I don't have any friends and my family are all biased. My family have seen me sit at home for years and want me out of the house all the time. I am constantly getting told to get out more and do more things but what they dont understand is that I can't cope with what I am doing now.
My actual job is exhausting and stressful too. I work in fashion retail so I feel like everyone walks into the store and judges me. If I dont look 'fashionable' or 'pretty' enough than I am not worth their time. One day I went to work with less makeup on and got told by a bunch of people I looked tired, the only thing different I did that day is that I wore less concealer.
This is a bit of a rant but I would also like to hear your opinions and insight on this because I can't think straight and there is no-one to talk to. Thankyou.

Hypothetical question: if after of decades of trying to fit in, and to understand other people, you found out with proof and certainty you were not actually human (in that your body, mind, and spirit in too many ways work completely differently to everyone else's, and you completely lacked certain common and vitally/socially essential human traits), what would you do? And say you didn't have a family. How would you find purpose in living? What could you do in/for human society? What would you do with your life, how would you find your people, your place, your connection to the living? 

Any clues? (Any ideas, not matter how childish or wild are appreciated. Feel free to brainstorm. Thanks...)

Just now I scored a 48% depression and 15% anxiety. Moderate and mild. This morning I dropped my partner off at work and on the way home I cried. Straight faced and silent, tears methodically welling up and one by one rolling down my face. I felt aware of my thoughts at the time as I was trying to figure out why but I could not pin-point any string of thoughts that may have caused it. Is this normal for others that have scored similar on their tests? Before my dog died I never cried for anything. Honestly, I even fought so hard to be strong for my wife when our lifeless dog was on the vet table; I didn't even cry then. I think the next 1000 times I was alone after that though I cried like I hadn't since I was a child. And after that day, I guess I just cry now. I went from never crying - to crying for no reason. I wasn't even thinking about him this morning. He died late last year. Am I still feeling the effects of this? I'm changed for ever now. It might sound silly to some but my partner and I were closer to that dog than we were to anyone else.

I spent a year of my life majorly depressed, sleeping all day, overeating and hating myself. I was unemployed, not studying and isolating myself from everyone I knew. Then I started getting better and was living a pretty normal life for the next 2 years. But the past few months on the days I don’t have uni or work I’ve been so unbelievably lethargic, just like when I was depressed. I stay in my room all day with no energy to do anything, beating myself up for not being productive whilst not actually doing anything about it. I don’t know how to get out of this rut. I just want the energy and motivation to get out of bed in the mornings but all I can do is sleep - and when I oversleep I become more tired... it’s a vicious cycle. It’s like the physical motions of daily life are so overwhelming but that seems so melodramatic. I’m just scared that this will snowball and affect the other domains of my life (like work/uni/friends) like last time. I can’t be the only one, surely. Please share if this is something you struggle with and let me know what you did to fight against it, even with no energy. I’m exhausted

Hi there, 
I'm not exactly too good at conveying my thoughts in a succinct manner, so I'm sorry if this get's confusing. 
As the title says I don't really feel anything anymore. I sort of walk around like some sort of robot, going through the motions, feigning happiness when I'm in my classes at uni and I don't know if this is normal? It's almost like my base mood is really quite low and flat, and that I feel empty as if there's nothing left in me. I don't genuinely feel happiness (only fleeting moments), I don't even feel sad a lot of the time, I just don't really feel anything.
I'll admit, I've put myself through a lot of sleep deprivation due to studying which started maybe around year 12 (so I've done it on and off for about 3 years), and my diet hasn't been the best so that could be why I feel low on energy at times, but I have been working on sleeping more instead of staying up late to finish work. 
Despite this, my low / empty feelings persist, it feels more than just tiredness. I don't care for things anymore. Things don't give me any satisfaction, I don't get really upset over things anymore (aside from when I'm super stressed from uni and break down haha), I don't get really happy over anything either. Music, the one thing which I swore I could never live without, which used to make me feel good, is now starting to sound like noise in my ears to block out the world. I don't really know why I am this way. 
I used to put this ""deadness"" down to my personality, I've been this dry/kind of emotionless person for as long as I can remember, but I think lately it's gotten a little worse. I was always told as a child to ""smile more"" or to stop being pessimistic etc. but now I've kind of begun to wonder whether this is just my personality or if it is something more? 
At times, on top of my low mood I get hit with really dark periods where I lose all motivation, I don't talk to anyone (not that I have anyone aside from my family to talk to anyway), I don't do anything. I just sit in bed and watch crap on netflix or youtube to distract myself from the thoughts. I feel that I cry more easily nowadays (and I don't really know why because I don't feel extremely sad) and these periods have started happening more frequently as of late. 
I don't know if this is depression. I don't have any real reason to be depressed. Is it all in my head? I really have no idea anymore. Has anyone felt the same way before?

Hi all,
I am just writing because I woke up this morning at 3am Perth time and my first thought was “I cannot do this anymore” and have cried for about an hour. Long story short, I have just returned from a trip to the US & New Zealand and just had my 30th birthday yesterday.I have been over my job for a while and have applied for numerous other positions to no avail. 
I feel so down and out when I shouldn’t because I have everything. I am single with no kids which is what I want.
I travel a lot and have never felt this way after any of my trips..EVER!
Does anyone else feel like this or felt like this?

Is there some way to identify whether a job is worsening depression or whether I’m finding work difficult because I don’t have the coping strategies. My job situation is good. Excellent income, flexibility, I can work from home and be with my children. The work isn’t hard but it isn’t what I ever planned to do. Multiple promotions brought me to a middle management role that’s very processed based. It’s a competitive environment but I feel that if I was well, I could just do the work and not worry too much about the politics. It would let me be happy that I could spend a lot of time with family as I can work from home. I’m scared of leaving and discovering Thi Gs weren’t too bad once I’m well again and I’ve given up a good job and the flexibility my family needs. At work I am hyper conscious of every email I send, everything I say and how it might come back. I double check everything I do in case there are any mistakes and meetings with my very lovely boss are a central cause of stress in case I’ve done something wrong. I took a large break of leave which my company was really good about and felt good when I returned but all slid downhill again  
I don’t know how to know where the line is between being sick and things being hard and something making me worse

I don't know if this is the right forum for this thread but I was wondering if anyone had any helpful advice or anything.
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 14 and am now almost 30, it has not gotten better, if anything it has gotten worse. I was diagnosed with PTSD after a sexual assault a few years ago, and I am struggling.
My partner is super supportive of me, my family is understanding and only ever wants to help. I am medicated and not currently in counselling though have not found it hugely helpful.
I am tired all the time, I could not be bothered doing anything, my performance at work is slipping and my anxiety is rising. I become so frustrated and overwhelmed that today I stood in my hallway and screamed as I was feeling overwhelmed with the dogs. I often feel like I am screaming in my head anyway but I don't usually physically scream. I don't want to go to work, I want to die, not necessarily kill myself I just don't want to do this anymore, fighting is hard and I am not sure it is worth it, I tried self-harming as that used to relieve the stress a bit but it doesn't help anymore, I have constant headaches and body pain and I just couldn't be bothered.
I used to love cooking and art and all kinds of things, but I just can't be bothered. I feel as though my continued existence is always going to be this crappy I don't want to keep fighting to work 60 hours a week for no benefit, my mood stays the same whether I am poor or have enough to get by, I don't know what to do anymore, I am tired of spending $100 per hour for therapy to be old to keep a diary.
What do you do to help when you feel overwhelmed?

Hey all
Recently (about 5 weeks ago) I went to a party and tried some drugs and ended using a large amount throughout the night. The following couple of days were the worst days of my life I couldn’t sleep for 4-5 days, I was anxious, sad, confused etc. I thought it would pass as i was most likely withdrawing from the drugs. Now 5 weeks on I’m feeling very emotional, low and sad. I don’t enjoy anything in life even though I have a great family, plenty of friends. I sit around and crying for no reason, my sleep pattern is bad and I have all these weird dreams. I’m scared because I don’t know what’s going on given a day before I made this stupid mistake I was a happy man with no complaints in life. I have seen a GP and have started medication recently.

On Thursday I sat in my doctors office and sobbed about a certain situation and all I could really explain as to why was that ""it's just really what I didn't want"".  The only response she could give was that it is outside my control, it is what it is.
Yesterday I had a conversation with my husband about an unrelated matter expressing my anger that it's just not ""fair"" how another situation has played out.  These people could have had compassion, but instead have chosen to remain uninvolved and in some regards isolate me.
My disappointment in both these situations is palpable, one leading to an overwhelming sense of sadness and threatening to cripple me, the other triggering a simmering anger toward certain people where I want to tell them exactly what I think and cut them out of my life once and for all.
How do I deal with that?  How do I come to terms with disappointment?  I've come to understand that disappointment is often caused by expectations not being met, but at some point you've got to have a win right?  You can't go through life with no expectations, hopes or dreams, always believing you deserve nothing more than the least desirable outcome!  What's the point?
It's so tiring always accepting what feels like second best.

Hello,
A lot of us (me included). take to our bed for days on end when we are depressed.
This is unhealthy for us...We need to look after us as best we can, I feel we should try as hard as we possibly can to make up a routine to keep us healthy and get us out of bed.
  I believe we need structure in our lives more so when we are depressed, 
A sense of structure is important to provide goal to your day, it gives a pattern to your day which supports your body's natural health structure.

I think it's important to try to go to bed each night around the same time. Put away your phones,I pads etc, put on some soft music and drift away to sleep.
Set the alarm to get up the same time each day, but don't just wake up, get up out of bed, open blinds, curtains the doors,  let some sunlight into your home. 
Try having a healthy breakfast, lunch and dinner, keeping  roughly the same times to eat and enjoy the meals, we need to eat healthy meals daily to fuel our bodies for healing.
Try having a morning and afternoon cup of tea or coffee, maybe a couple of bickies as well, or my favourite cake.


Try some light excersises  throughout the day, or go for a short walk daily. even walking around your yard, just doing something will give our mind a rest.

A daily bath or shower either morning, night or both, a bath or shower late at night might releases some stress and many relaxe us  a little for sleeping. 

House work, not fun but necessary to keep our environment clean and healthy, set a day for washing, another day for ironing, try washing the dishes daily.

Even if we just set a few of these goals to start with, it will still give us a purpose for the day, a purpose to get out of bed. 
Once we get into a routine we can then slowly add to our days activities to maybe add some social events, hobbies, things we like to do, things we enjoy doing.  
Recovery has to come from us, we can't give up on us. We have to try to help ourselves to mend our broken minds. 
All these activities will be doing mindfulness, getting our mind away from our dark thoughts while we are carrying out these simple but necessary tasks. 
All thoughts are welcome.
Kindness only ,
Karen..(GG).

Hi
My partner told me to leave 7 days ago because he was struggling. 
He seemed to raise minor negatives aimed at me as the reason for his decision of needing time alone. I wrongly pushed for answers and he blocked my number and will not communicate. 
I visited him on day 6 to let him know I was worried about him where his reply was “I’m ok”. Then he left. 
I am unsure how to go about this. I deeply care for him which he knows but the abruptness of him shutting me out has left me not knowing what to do or where I stand. 
We were planning our future together and I’m just not sure whether his state of mind has ended the relationship without me actually knowing. I don’t want to even ask. 
I don’t know how to help him or whether I should make contact by email or maybe even visit again in a week. 
I need advice as I love him and don’t want to lose him and without being in contact I have no idea how he is.

I have had depression and anxiety for a while now.
I also have social anxiety and that means I can find it hard to sometimes pick up some social cues in the workplace. I am trying hard but I have a long road ahead of me and I know it does annoy my coworkers a bit. But I do try.  However, lately I have become the subject of workplace bullying.  I feel like it's because of my personality in the workplace. The person in question has worked with me for a long time and is now acting as my manager, which they have done in the past.   I know I have made a few minor errors but this person makes it out or be a massive deal and goes out of their way to publicly humiliate me. If I take the initiative to do something then they'll ask me how come I'm doing it. If there's something that my normal manager wouldn't even say is a mistake but is just not the way this particular person likes things done then they'll still pick up on it and yell at me in front of everyone. She doesn't treat the other staff like that and I know they make mistakes too. She just straight out yells, then sends a rude e-mail instead of calmly explaining things I don't even know are wrong and are minor procedural issues. Sometimes there's not even a mistake but she doesn't say sorry. She just finds something else or makes another one up. 
I may not be the most talented employee or be the best reader of social cues but I work hard and stay late and try to be proactive. 
This person has been there for  sometime, if good at their job and is liked by all the managers and the staff. I know there are formal procedures in place but I also know that they are very hard when it comes to getting outcomes and are usually just discarded because you can't prove anything and in an office full of nepotism and favorites where I was one of the few people hired through a normal interview process,  I have no one to back me up. Even my normal manager is best friends with this lady so won't back me up when she comes back- but I don't think this will stop as this lady is also unofficially quite high up.
So now I don't want to go to work. I spend my weekends in bed crying and not going out, even to buy food. I am trying to look for another job but can't think of nice things to say about myself in an application. I also have no appointments left with my therapist. 
Has anyone dealt with this before or know what to do? I can't stop going to work for financial reasons but I feel I can't go anymore.

I'm not really sure if this is an acceptable thing to be posting publically but I need advice.. the 2 manic episodes I've had in the past involved me taking speed not long beforehand.. say 2 weeks or a week then getting involved with a guy that was really good in bed and would have a really full on background (criminal, drug dealer). Had a little crazy in them that was attractive to me I guess.. well the last one was 6 years ago. Since then I met someone, had 2 kids, recently broke up 3 months ago.. I've also recently been diagnosed with bipola and put on medication for it.  Any way I'd slept with a couple of people I used to hook up since the break up which was fine I was lonely and what not, no issue at all.. well I recently come across someone I knew but in the past but never had been with. Didnt do any drugs with them, I'm not even drinking alcohol clean of everything since I had kids. The same deal.. really great sex. I'm not going through full on mania but I feel like its unleashed something within me I mean its tolerable I just dont get it.. I've searched about this online, alot of info says that hypersexuality is common with bipola disorder and during mania but I cant find anything on it causing mania. It's like (without going into too much detail) that I get such a euphoric feeling that I get all at once, that only a few have been able to give me it unleashes emotions that rambles the chemicals in my brain. I mean it made sense before beause of the drugs and the alcohol but now I'm on meds and I dont do anything intoxicating at all. I even get alot of sleep at night because of the meds. The meds stop any intrusive thoughts. I feel really good alot of the time. But my spending online is out of control and i get distracted a fair bit when i am shopping online. That's been happening since the break up. I'm even a bit hesitant on mentioning this to my doctor because I dont want to be medicated where I cant function properly when theres not a very big issue.. there is a bit of one with my online shopping and being distracted but that's all. Im really sorry if this isnt appropriate and I dont mean to bring any attention on myself. But I'd love some advice if I can, TIA.

Hey everyone , recently it took me a while to finally realise I am depressed . . 
I've had a really intense breakup with my girlfriend who was seeing someone else towards the end of the relationship . It hit me like a train I was dating her for 3.5 years and was planning on getting married to her . 
What also bothers me is the fact that I confided with this girl , I told her everything about me , even my darkest secrets . And I genuinely loved her and her family which I have never felt in any other relationship. 
So relationship is done . Denial . What if she ... No it's over ! How do I move on from this ? How am I supposed to to go solo when I have been planning my life with this person ? To much pressure . My life is spiralling out of control . I'm agitated , angry . At my self , it's my fault I couldn't see it for what it was . My work life is starting to get effected 
I was trying really hard to move on , trying to hang out with mates . And get my mind off things . Something wasn't right though . I'm participating in usual fun activities but they aren't doing a thing . Motorbike riding , gym , bushwalking, social gathos. All these things I don't even want to get out of bed for . Because I get no enjoyment out of anything anymore , just numbness . 
To make matters worse she is now hanging out with my mates . By herself . These are my friends that she only knew through me . So I feel betrayed by my own mates . Anger . Depression , Numbness . I was sick of feeling nothing . 
I started to use alcohol ,getting drunk every weekend . That wasn't enough . Marijuana came into my life , which I am very guilty about.  It has actually temporary made me feel awesome.  It's great , however it effects my work performance being in a cloudy haze . 
So now I'm in a hole because I think I am getting over her and my ""friends "" but now I have an addiction problem, because whenever I feel too overwhelmed I find it to easy to just smoke up, and forget about real life .
 I know something needs to change , I want to feel happy again , I want to be able to enjoy activities again without the need for marijuana or alchohol . I just hope some people can relate 
Hope that wasn't too long to read I just needed to vent somewhere

So i dont really know where to put this, I guess being bipola type II I thought this might be a good place. I've recently given up drinking but today I realised I'm buying alot of things online for my son who's about to turn 3. I've always got some kind of addiction to keep me happy and at the moment I'm dealing with a recent separation I guess I need to figure something to keep me happy without the negativity..  I mean shoppings not too bad but it is costly I just want to be content without needing something all the time. I guess I really want to get active and be happy with that but its not quite warm enough to get out with the pram yet (I've also got a 1 yo)

Hi,
its been raining for the last few days in Brisbane here.  I feel that my mood also swings which  acts like the weather - extremely restless and depressing.  On those sunny days my mood seems to be better! 
Does anyone feel the same or just me ??

lately the stress and anxiety has got so bad and so constant,that it feels like I'm just going around in circles with trying,failing and then hating myself for the failures I've made. I have tried to let it out to others and it seems they are sick of hearing it. I don't want to be a burden to anyone anymore...so why bother even telling anyone if it's a let down. Sometimes my mind get's so bombarded by unwanted thoughts that I just want to scream. I feel like I'm just constantly drowning and slowly get deeper and deep in the 'ocean'. It has consumed me so much I think I have unfortunately reached that breaking point.It is so exhuasting having to pretend I'm 'okay' and all calm infront of others,but in reality I'm dying inside,hating myself and just mentally broken and drained.This may sound strange but,It's like I'm soo used to being anxious,depressed and on going (pressure mentally) that it feels out of the blue and kind of 'empty' when it's not happening. I don't want to feel this way anymore,but at the same time I don't want to get better or fight it anymore. It's like I'm just stuck inbetween wanting to get better and actually be 'happy' and then just drowning and staying in my fears and sorrows to not be a burden and fear I will just relapse and be a failure again. I feel like such a failure,but so mentally exhuasted it's hard for me to keep going some day without wanting to just snap and break down. Although, the worst thing is letting down others. That is what I fear the most and have always been the reason why I feel so much pressure to keep being me and trying to be strong,happy and push through it. It frustrates me that these such negatives things have to exist in our lives. But life unfortunately has it's negative and scarring battles to get through to be a better person.I guess.

We have just lost our dog of 10 years. My husband is 82 and not well. He was the thread which kept us going. A help to my husband when he wasn't well. My help when I needed it. We have lost our best friend. It hurts just as much as when I lost my son. I have been to the dr. And a psychologist..but I don't really want to do this anymore. I am not suicidal.,,,but it is now too hard. No....I don't want another dog..Eddie was one of a kind...almost human. Our day and night was devoted to Eddie. Just don't know what to do. Everywhere we went Eddie was there too. Am so so lost.

Hey guys,

In January I left my $70K Navy job after 8 years full time service. I'm 36 years old. Prior to joining the military I worked as a Travel Consultant, a Retail Salesman and Freelance Web Developer. I have been actively looking for part time/full time work since Dec last year and haven't been able to find the right company. This has forced me to freelance full time but I can't bring in more than $350 a week.

In Dec I started applying for multiple Gov/Admin/Customer Service/Web Design roles via Seek/Linkedin and Jobs WA. Two months went by and I had collected about 20 job rejections. I approached two recruiters in Perth in April and was offered a top gun interview at Robert Half Recruiting. In the group interview I failed to sell myself and didn't get offered a second interview. At about the same time I received a phone call from a web design agency for a front end web developer role. I aced the interview but lacked the skills they needed to replace their senior developer. That job only lasted 2 weeks and was unpaid. This had a really negative effect on me. It made me realise I had no skills in the real world anymore that would get me a decent paying job. 
Before I knew it 5 Months went past and I still had no job. Then in June at a networking event I met Macmahon who were offering truck driving jobs in the mines. They called me up for a video interview but I couldn't stop thinking about going away for 2 weeks, coming home for 1 week and working 12 days stuck in a truck. My brain was talking me out of it. 

By this stage it was July and I was starting to feel the financial pressure. To pay my bills I started throwing a lot more attention at my online freelance web design business which was bringing in an average of $300 p/wk. Given that my expenses were more than that winter would see me spiral into a hole of anxiety and depression. Until finally I went and saw the doctor who said I was low on Vitamin D. Once my blood levels were normal I started feeling ok again but I still had no job and my freelance business was getting hard. Chasing clients for money, working for free. Spending 14 hour days in front of the computer. I was beginning to go insane. When I decided I needed to redesign my website and start taking money up front. This would work for a few weeks but the past month I have only managed to bring in $250. I realise this career is never going to be easy but it seems like all I have with having to go FIFO.

By this stage it was late September and I had racked up at least 50 job rejections. Then out of the blue I had three opportunities all at once. My friend up in Tom Price said his company would take me on as a trade assistant for $45 p/hr (12 hour days) on a 2/1 roster. I had a website enquiry for a $3k in house web contract and an interview with a leading IT company in Perth for a 4 week unpaid internship. So out of all those opportunities which one do I pick. The unpaid no guarantees unpaid internship. Not only did I screw my mate around but I turned down two paid jobs for a IT internship that is designed for uni graduates in the hope that I might get a new career out of it. Am I clutching straws? I know Im worth more than working for free for a month.

I don't know who I am anymore. Why the hell would I take a unpaid internship over guaranteed work? Well it's a big gamble as I can't live on my current freelance income and things don't look like they're going to get better on the job application front.

To summarise, I have spent 20 years working ""not ideal"" jobs and my main skill web design is useless because it doesn't pay enough to live comfortably. I would get more money on welfare. It' really sad. I appreciate the clients I do have but my business has failed. The sooner I realise this the sooner my life will get better. I just don't know where to go from here.

Hi Everyone.
This is my first time posting. I have been on a Disability Support Pension (DSP) for the past 7 years due to suffering from anxiety and depression which was preventing me from keeping a job and doing many hours. The DSP was an absolute blessing as I was in a really bad mental state, but ofcourse it was very hard to obtain. Last year I got reviewed which was very stressful and damaging to my mental state, but my application was accepted to stay on DSP. Recently I have been offered work (up to 10hrs a week) my psych thinks it will help my self esteem, but I am worried if I start working again even though it is only a small amount of hours, that I will be reviewed and taken off DSP which I don't feel ready to do. Any advice or personal experience would be appreciated.

Hello,
Struggling with depression and social anxiety for 20+ years to varying degrees.  Seeing a psych and trying my best for the most part.
On holiday vefore starting a new job and staying with family.
Had a quick hello with some new people and one gave everyone a hug as she was leaving as ""shes a hugger"" and I felt a mental dam burst, I felt/feel so ashamed, normally that wouldnt bother/effect me but it was a short and it takes me awhile (weeks) to warm up to people, I'm not particularly shy but I can be quiet when I have nothing to say.  Just woefully sad that all I could manage was a hello, that a hug was wasted.
On the train back I had to cover my face from my early teens niece and nephew as I was crying and trying to jeep it together.  I think my oldest niece picked up on it and switched seats to rest her head on me and all I could do was hold it in like supressing a grenade.
Just one of those days where its easier to be alone rather than hurt people.  Most days talking to people feels like we're a million miles apart, disconnected or forced conversations, unnatural to fill time but can never grow.
 Venting to release some pressure.  Would go for a walk but in a bad neighborhood.
Regards.

Hi there,
im not sure if I’m stressed, depressed or something else but i am having a tough time coping at present and had a complete meltdown yesterday. Doc says medication wont help, and referred me to a psychologist. Honestly i think i would be better talking to the staff at the supermarket checkout for all the help she was - 2 sessions, had a chat, showed me an app for ‘minfulness’ - i really don’t think that she was of any use at all. The mindfulness is a good start, but now i have the app what do i need a psych for?
my partner is at a loss to help me either, and wants to send me away to a ‘wellness’ retreat next week. I appreciate that these things cost a lot of money and not everyone is able to afford that so i feel lucky that i can have such an opportunity, but i am questioning whether i will get any benefit. Maybe I’m better off taking a week off work and booking as many massage and yoga classes as i can locally instead.
does anyone have any experience with these type of retreats? Can they help when you are at the point of full meltdown, or are they just for busy people who need an excuse for a few days off? What if i have another meltdown while i’m Away, then i wont have my partner there to hug me, and I don’t think they offer that level of care at these wellness retreats. 
any opinions or personal feedback is much appreciated :)

I have decided to write this post as a guide for anyone applying for disability under the terms of mental illness. A number of years ago now 11 to be precise, I was offered the opportunity to apply for disability. I had left a full time job to be with my family who were moving state, I couldn't change this.I had always suffered from episodes of depression and anxiety, but had coped enough to pursue qualifications and a few jobs. Because I needed the support of my family to cope, I left my job, and intended to find another, but that sadly did not eventuate. This put me on a collision course with government policy. Within months of leaving work and trying to find another job, I found myself in one Work for the Dole program after another, I suffer from fatigue due to depression and severe sleep apnea. Because the WFD programs didn't cater to my illnesses, I  was picking up trash by the roadside, travelling kilometres on foot to be degraded and treated like bludging garbage and made to feel as if I was being exploited, which even though possibly not the intention was the end result, throwing me into deep depression, and even thoughts of suicide. I have no doubt other people feel the same with the current way of treating the unemployed. I wanted work, I couldn't get it, and within three WFD programs I was suffering severe anxiety to go along with my chronic depression, and extreme fatigue, from all that goes along with WFD, threats of non-compliance, treatment as if you are worthless and looked down upon, being put into programs that don't give skills or training to improve chances of getting back into the workforce, or worse aggravate illnesses such as high levels of fatigue that I personally would avoid when going after jobs, given my severe sleep apnea.  I so desperately wanted work, and my mental health was crashing, eventually, I was assessed as being ""Unfit to work""... and at this stage, I truly was, the system had done more to take away my confidence and aggravate mental health issues than working ever could, I had gone from holding it together to maintain work and be part of the world to being unable to be part of anything. The tunnel with that glimmer of hope at the end, the one that said, you'll find work again, there is a way out of this hell, seemed longer and longer. I was in the deepest depression I have ever been in, and the lifeline that was the DSP, turned out to be the rope that would bind me, and drag me to the deepest depths of despair.

Hello There! I have tried a lot of things without success so I thought I would call out for help on this site. Have been with same partner for many years and we have lived in hope of having a family however we are unable due to medical problems (my side). We are both in our 40's now and my partner has tried to comfort me by saying that she doesn't feel she could cope with having a family now anyway. This 'hope' kept me going for over 20 years and now I am trying to accept that it is not to be. Also I am struggling financially - I had a small business that we had to close last year - a business that I had put a lot of 'hope' in for the future. I have reached a point in my life where I cannot think of anything to get up for in the morning. I have a steady job which is just a 'job' and it just pays the bills but every day is a worry. I seemed to have lost all sense of purpose and direction in my life. I have started drinking heavily and am also on depression medication. I often wish there was a quick way out of this life without hurting anyone else. Sorry to ramble on but I just don't know where to turn anymore. Has anyone ever felt like this and got past it? I've tried all sorts of motivational recordings and videos. I've tried goal-setting. I can't think off anything I would like to be, do or have anymore..............

Hi, 
New here. How do you know if you suffer from depression? I've done the Beyond Blue questionnaires etc which say 'yes, you are' but I'm scared about going down a path I maybe can't back out of (eg medication, counselling etc)
I have felt for a while that I may suffer from depression and/or anxiety. It seems to come and go, especially the depression (very 'event based' if something goes wrong) - this usually manifests as feeling physically ill in the stomach, castrophising things, becoming very tired and irritable etc. But sometimes I feel perfectly fine.   
All in all, I have been not sleeping well recently, have been irritable at my partner, eating poorly, and have zero sex drive - so I feel like something is wrong. I just don't know if a doctor will be able to help, or if I'm wasting their time. 
 Anxiety-wise as well, I'm panicking about talking to a doctor because I don't know what to say, or if it will help, or if I'll end up being medicated forever and feel like I'm not 'me'. 
 Does anyone else go through this? And/or have any tips?

I don’t feel like eating one day or I eat a lot the other day. I’m just a little confused on what I should do next because I don’t know when this will end or whatever. I really feel like I’m not the original me. I love my family but recently I feel disconnected with them. I don’t feel like talking to them anymore and become more harder to concentrate on normal days. Please give some help :) thanks.

I have depression and for a while I managed, but over the last three months everything has come crashing down, I have three daughters, two of which have children and I have no relationship with any of them, I am made to feel guilty because of my depression and what I put them through when they were younger, they tolerate me, I have no bond with any of them and this hurts so much, I have a husband who loves me and my family is there for support, but lately even that doesn't help, I used enjoying crocheting, but even that is now too much of an effort to do, I have no joy or happiness, and life is like one hurdle I struggle to get over.  I often thinks whats the point, I am so over everything and everyone, I don't sleep all that often because my brain won't stop, I don't enjoy life.  I go through the motions and that's about it, I pretend everything is okay, yet deep down inside I ache and hurt, there are times when I just to give up and hide in the corner and have no-one around me, there are time when I want to be left alone.  I have been through this before, but this time it hurts more.

I've been diagnosed with depression for the second time in 5 years, I've been feeling like this a long time before I was prescribed antidepressants again. I was afraid to go through this all again because it brings back memories of how bad I was 5 years ago. Every day I think of how bad of a place I was in back then. I didn't want to say anything because I wanted to be strong in my relationship with my girlfriend as she had her own battles to deal with. My memory has been so bad that I forget things,  which then eventually lead to her not trusting me. I would misread text messages from her and would reply incorrectly ( I have the auditory processing disorder, which I think she forgot I had), my responses and use of incorrect words would always work against me. 
My depression has been really bad in the past 3 weeks and only 2 weeks ago she broke up with me, I've never cried so much in my life. Every night for 2 weeks, I wrote her letters to try and get her back.  I would stay up all night thinking of what to write. What hurt the most is that she would say "" I'm scared, you're mentally not well"" please leave me to alone, you're scaring me. Her hurtful words have scared me. 
She thinks I'm, not the person she fall in love with, I haven't slept more than 4 hours in over 3 weeks .
I've put on a brave face for months during our relationship,  but I've really been hurting so much.
When I told her how bad of a place I was in after she broke up with me, she said you looked fine the other day. yeah, because I'm putting on a brave face and smiling. I wasn't sighing because I wanted to take a deep breath, I was sighing because I was struggling so much.
Breaking up through a text has hurt me so much, every time I look at my phone I remember reading the text. 
Knowing she has already moved on and I'm here lonely battling with myself, I feel worthless.
To have someone leave you while you're in a dark place mentally doesn't help, and to lose the love of your life makes it so much harder.

Hi there. I’ve just found out I have Bipolar Disorder.
I received my diagnosis 2 weeks ago - a birthday present for my 50-something birthday. Yay. I’ve been on (often self-prescribed) anti-depressants intermittently for many years. However since the death of my mother 3 years ago I have struggled with grief, depression, and increasing irritability and mood swings particularly over the last 6-12 months.
As a self employed medical practitioner and surgeon (and main income earner for my family) I’ve had to keep going despite physical or mental illness ever since my internship. I had to go back to work the day after my mum’s funeral. There is no one there to see or operate on our patients if we have to go home sick.
So we push through. And self-treat in order to keep secret our mental health issues.
Why have I finally been properly diagnosed? Because a close friend and colleague of mine picked up the warning signs of hypomania/bipolar and staged an intervention with the help of my sister, who is a very experienced mental health nurse. I had to promise to see a psychiatrist and stop prescribing for myself.
So here I am. Bipolar. Stunned. Disappointed. Even a bit devastated at the diagnosis. My psychiatrist is lovely, but the immediate reduction of my antidepressant dose was torture. I refused a second medication at the start as I can’t afford to have a tremor (as a surgeon!!!). So I was commenced on an anticonvulsant and an antipsychotic medication. After 2 weeks of awful depression I was then happy to take anything to ease my anguish so agreed to add the second medication I'd previously refused to the mix.
Yesterday I gave in to the multiple meds and filled a dosette. Yay. Have gone from taking one tablet a day to about 9 a day. Suspect I have gained a couple kgs already despite significant amounts of exercise and a healthy diet - double yay.
But there is no choice, keep on going I must. Hide my diagnosis I must - now more than ever. It was just becoming acceptable in the medical profession to have reactive depression but Bipolar - no way!! Who wants to be seen by a crazy doctor? Who wants to be in business with or work alongside a Bipolar doctor? Who won’t scrutinise the Bipolar doctor constantly - watching out for signs of mania or depression?
Hopefully I will improve rapidly on my meds so I can cope with the extra demands of emergency call-backs, writing and giving talks and completing difficult medical reports.
Thanks for letting me whinge on line.

I’m just wondering if anyone else has the same experiences that I do.
 
Some days I’ll be feeling really really low and anxious. I’ll wake up before my alarm and lie awake for half an hour feeling anxious and worrying about work. When I’m feeling anxious I have tingling in my hands and feet and I feel like I have butterflies in my chest. I’ll keep feeling anxious until I actually get to work and then I feel a little better. 
On some days I’ll feel so sad that I find myself tearing up on my way to work. More than once I’ve just broken down on the train and couldn’t stop crying.
On these days I know I should be going to my GP to get some help but because I work so far away from home I can never seem to get there.
Then on some days I feel perfectly fine and happy and I wonder whether I actually need to go see the GP. On these days I seem to forget how bad the other days were or I feel like I can fix it by myself.
Is it normal to feel this way?

My parents have been harassing me all this year to get a job, even though they know I have depression and anxiety issues ( they thing that its bullcrap). So last week I was forced to go job hunting and I applied for about 20 jobs, the majority replied that they will not be processing my application any further. I haven't even gotten an Interview yet, and all these jobs were simple retail and customer service jobs. I wanted to go to centerlink to see if they could help me but my mother said that because my family owes a lot of debt to centerlink I wasn't a lowed to go. My parents are always fighting over finances, my mother puts be down the majority of the time. My father says he wishes he never had children especially girls. I think it would be better if I just disappeared that way everyone would be happy. Then again its like I never existed in the first place. I dont even know what love is. I feel so under valued and I just wished I wasn't born.

I am looking for advice to find the road back to being a functional human. The last ten years have seen be become an unemotional blob that uses alcohol to balance myself. This has worked awesomely (not). I have lost my job and isolated myself from those tht were previously close to me. I want to be a normal person again but do not know where to start. I know deep down what I need to do but the negative voices are too loud. As far as the drinking goes, it's hard to get away from as the few people I socialise with are also heavy drinkers. I feel like I'm drowning and that most have given up on me. I don't know what to do as, being unemployed makes it quite difficult to get councelling.

Hello,
i have been going so well with everything until something happened at work.
we had an incid not I was involved in and ever since then things have changed so, so much.  I feel as though they blame me for what happened still.
And there has been been some other things that have set me backwards too.

There are so many people that say they care about people with depression and anxiety and do nothing. For example, Beyond Blue has a contact form via email. You sit there for an hour telling them what is happening and all you get is a email response saying how they feel for you and look for answers on their website. News Flash, I went to your website, did not find the answers, so I sent you an email. 
Been on antidepressants for 15 years. My GP has tried all the types. Nothing worked. Read about TMS and thought that might work. But TMS can only be referred by a psychiatrist. So get referred to one. Of course he knows some wonder drug that I have most likely already tried over the last 15 years and insists on trying those first. Both had bad side effects. But I course he knew better and accused me of lying about the side effects as he was not aware of them. Maybe he should learn to use the internet.
So got him to approve TMS. Unfortunately it did not work. But I wanted a different psychiatrist and I was not connecting with that one. He accused me of being a racist. He was of Indian background and argued that was the reason for wanting to changing. He also accused me of lying to him. So this is how a mental health professional treats a person with mental health issues.
As I have said, pills have not worked over 15 years. I had TMS on the right side of the brain, so wanted to try it on the left side. Of course new psychiatrist thinks he has some magic pill that all the others before him have been too stupid to think of.
None, of them will listen to you. None of them care what you are going through. They are only interested in putting people into boxes and charging $170 per 15 minutes. Of course this means that they only work 2 days per week and have every second month off on holidays.
I NEVER have a positive experience. I cannot think of anything that would make me feel good. I have bad days and worse days, nothing else. I sit in a chair most nights shaking and heart pounding. I feel like I need to run away, but can't figure out where to run to. Even driving a car means that I have this urge to pull over and curl up in a ball and I don't know why. I just feel like I need to hit something to take out my frustration in not knowing what to do.
You can't live a life like this.
How do you find someone that will actually care about you. The ones that people recommend are all booked up. It even takes you a month to get into a bad one. It all just seems hopeless

I love my kids and I love my husband but just lately I  feel like is this it? Like everyday is the same, I just wanted more out of life and I’m scared this is it. I know is sounds awful and I’ve been felt this before and I try to shrug it off but it always comes back. I’ve never really been single or just been me. I pretty much went from one relationship to another. I’ve always been someone’s somebody and now I feel so much responsibility for everyone else. I can’t make a move or do anything without the thought of my husband or kids. I wish I had more time to be selfish before when I was not responsible for anyone. Now I feel stuck, as if all my role is to be a good house wife work and be a good mother. I honestly don’t think I even know who I am anymore. How am I supposed to teach my kids to be happy in their own skin when I’m miserable in mine?

Sick of my life. I'm sick of existing in pain all the time both mentally and physically. My depression is winning. I don't think anything can help. 
My medication doesn't seem to work. I've been seeing a psychologist but feel even that isn't enough to help me.
While I wouldn't harm myself I just pray everynight when I go to sleep that I just won't wake up the next day. Going through another day is unbearable 
I just needed to vent as I have no friends or support

Hi, 
I'm new here, well not that new I was on before but my account went AWOL, the posts are still there so I know it's nothing I said. But... besides that. Does anyone here have an issue with meeting someone or talking to women. (I'm a guy). The deal is, that I was put on disability for anxiety and severe depression many years ago, and even though, I tried, and tried, and ...... tried, to get a job, both by myself and through the almost pointless government job network, I never struck gold. Only employers paying below minimum wage, or hiring me to take over the job of two employees with that workload, taking the jobs only to be shown the door, one when I wanted to be paid legally, the other when the workload got too much, which happened rather quickly as the employer knew he was cutting corners and too cheap to get two people, like he had before me.
All this has resulted in, well 8 years of being on disability, and unlike others I've been assessed as being unable to work, not because I can't but because well, I don't gel with the way the system works, especially the job network because I wanted them to help me get into a paid starting position like an apprenticeship or training to get my life back. 
Now at the grand old age of almost 36 I am ineligible for any programs to get help, I don't even get reviewed or offered assistance because I'm over 35, and I'm exhausted. I could work a few days a week but no one, will give me a chance, ever, I actually bought a house in a town with no jobs, (west coast tas) and very little hope of employment. I was shocked that there was a job going cleaning toilets here....so I took my half uni degree (left because my mum has terminal cancer and it was impacting greatly), my 4 year old Cert IV - Networking qualification and applied, because I'll do anything just to have the chance of a job....why? when not even centrelink wants to get me back into the workforce? even though I cope better now days and could manage my anxiety working a few days a week.  
Well simply put, I feel worthless, not to my self but to anyone I might even consider talking to with a romantic interest, I've convinced my self that any women who is still single at my age won't be looking for a man with a lower income, I sometimes wonder if the need to be with someone and feel less alone in this world isn't enough? I never even attempt to talk to anyone I like because, I'm ashamed of my life, my worth, and my value to anyone else.

Hi guys, new poster here!
I was recently diagnosed with bipolar 1 (after some close calls and incidences) and feel almost lost about it. It's nice to have the confirmation and the possibility of accurate specific treatment but I'm terrified. The stigma and the social isolation of people with bipolar is such a hard trope to suddenly dispose of, now that I've joined their ranks. I knew my anxiety and depression were bad, and difficult to manage, but I always managed to barrel on and keep fighting, but now it feels like this is something I can't fight anymore. 
Weirdly, I'm sad that the new medication might take the mania away. Those ephemeral moments of complete and utter joy are so addictive, regardless of what risks they come with, especially when compared to the bleak gloom that blankets me the rest of the time. 
I'm not really sure what I'm looking for anymore. I don't need help socially or academically, I have no issues with romantic relationships or familial connections. Maybe just some assistance on how to make this diagnosis palatable, and to come to terms and be comfortable with it.
Sorry for the long read! I eagerly await to hear from the kind people of beyondblue!

Hi I’m new here and quite nervous about posting. I experience anxiety and depression symptoms quite frequently. I suffer from episodes of depression, anxiety and panic attacks.
 My moods shift quite rapidly I can be netrual one minute than anxious or angry the next. 
I feel as though I don’t know who I am.I subconsciously pick up traits of others, I always change my career choice and feel myself trying to be like other people. 
I feel as though I don’t really enjoy anything I don’t have any hobbies or any friends I hang out with. I find myself very attached and clingy in my relationships though. 
 I’m having a hard time knowing if I’m living or in a dream. I often feel as though I’m looking at myself from outside my body. 
When faced with stressful situations or conflict I am at my worst. I do not know how to cope with the difficulties of life.
 I am very sensitive and often over analysis everyone around me trying to see if they like me, if I’m doing something wrong. I feel as though I am wearing a mask in the surface I am happy bubbly (sometimes) and on the inside I am breaking down.
When I was 19 I was diagnosed with BPD. I recently went to a professional and from what they seen I  did not meet the diagnosis. I’m really confused with what I’m experiencing, I feel like I don’t have the answers I need. Does anyone else have similar experiences?

Hi there, I don't know how to put this into good words but I feel like I just lost interest in most of the things and I've been feeling empty, hard to make myself do things for the past two years. Before that I wasn't that super active but I had routines and kept myself fairly busy most of the time.
It started from when I was studying at uni in Europe two years ago. Few months into the course I noticed that I was in constant stress (course work, not making any close friends, long distance relationship and homesickness etc) and I couldn't sleep at night at all. I'll wake up at 3am and I felt like someone was choking me. I struggle to do my course work and was constantly crying before/after lectures. I wasn't eating a lot and lost some weight. It got to the point that I couldn't handle things anymore and decided to live with my bf who is my husband now.
Things have become better after I left uni and started living with my husband. I can sleep, I'm not in a constant panicky mood or constantly crying but the emptiness and my motivation hasn't  came back since then. 
On my days off from work, I usually drop off my husband at the station and go back to bed. I just stay in there, nap or just mess around in general and I just can't get any motivation to get out from bed. I don't feel tired but I just don't want to do anything. I do ""feel"" like doing stuff but I can't be asked.
Just before my husband comes back from work, well of course I have to do things so that's when I finally get motivation to cook and clean. He does try to keep me company and come up with things that we can do together. That helps a lot to distract me from those empty feelings.
The funny thing is I am absolutely okay when I am working. I can wake up, get out from bed, go to work and work all day without having any negative feelings. Not that I love working but it definitely helps me get through the day.
I don't know if I'm just lazy, tired or if I'm depressed or something. I'm most likely fine when I'm doing things with my husband and working. It's just when I'm alone is when the emptiness hits me. I guess I should just call out some friends but even that I just can't be asked anymore.

Hello I am new here and this is my first post. I was diagnosed with depression 15yrs ago after a bad breakup and recently I was also diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder (I thought I was just an introvert). I have been seeing a really great female psychologist and she has been helping me a lot but last week the clinic called and told me she has unexpectedly left the practice. Now I have to start all over again with a new psychologist. 
I am now 35, single and very lonely. I don't have any friends and I cannot seem to find a boyfriend. I am highly stressed about my ages and situation as all I ever wanted was to be a wife and a mother. I am a biology teacher and I know all about reproduction. People keep telling me that any man would be lucky to have me but all I feel is that I must be such a loser because no man wants me. I do not want to ge to a sperm bank (as suggested by several people, including family) because then I will be a single loser with a child. Having no man want me is the worst feeling in the world. 
I am also struggling in my job. My management are making things very difficult in a bid to push me out. It is making me question everything. Should I be doing this? Should I return to my previous career in hospitality where I feel my strengths are stronger? Should I move overseas? Several people have told me if they didn't have kids, they would move overseas in a heartbeat and said I should go since I have nothing to tie me down (except my cat). 
I am just so conflicted and confused and indecisive. I have no clue what to do. I literally spend all my time outside work at home alone. I have done a lot of internet research and I still can't work out what I want or what to do. I am frightened of making the wrong decision. If I move, maybe things will be better but maybe they will be worse. I don't remember the last time I was genuinely happy and excited about life. I feel like everyday I am just existing, going through the motions, like an empty vessel. I hate everything and find little joy in anything except cuddles from my cat. I feel like I am down a big deep dark hole and I have no idea how to get out. 
If there is anyone out there who can relate or has any advice I would love to hear it. I just need someone to talk to and, if possible, the fairy godmother to wave her wand and solve all my problems.

Im 16 and in year 11 this year, living in a country town. I'm pretty sure I don't have depression, but i feel as though I'm gradually becoming more and more down on myself.
The worst its been is this year, my two best friends moved to the city for school and my sister moved over seas. I feel as though I am alone. I know I still have my family, and I know they love me but I've never been close with them like I am with my two friends and sister. Without these people in my life anymore, I don't fit in with anyone because being in a small town all the social standings are already sorted, friendship groups are full and aren't going to budge anytime soon. school has also gotten harder for me. I've never been a straight A student or anything but its becoming more and more of a struggle to the point where I'll get so overwhelmed that I'll break down in tears and and feel this need to hit or throw something in frustration and then have no motivation to do anything. I cant make decisions, I can't remember the most simplest of things, I can't do anything right for anyone and I've never been good at anything or felt as though I had a purpose and this really eats at me.
I don't really want to be at home, I don't want to be with friends, I don't want to be at school, i don't want to be anywhere and i feel have no one I can talk with.
Is this just one of those silly teenage things? or is it something else? is there anything I can do to stop it?

Hi there.
I feel silly as I should be so blissfully happy, but feel so incredibly sad and alone.  We have been travelling around Oz for the last year and found a lovely place on the NSW south coast that we have fallen in love with.  We have bought a block of land and I have been very lucky to find work in a job that I enjoy, but I just feel so sad and alone.  My husband is 16 years older than me and we have been married for over 10 years and I love him, but I am starting to feel like the age gap is making a difference now. He suffers from depression and I was on medication for for depression a couple of years ago, but managed to wean myself off.  I yearn for a female friend that I can just, well be friends with, if that makes sense?  I love my dogs and love walking them and just would like to be friends with someone who has the same interests as me.  I do not have children by choice and am happy with that.  I was sexually abused as a child and never felt the need to breed as I would hate anyone to got through what I went through.  
I know that I sound like I am rambling, but I just feel so alone.

Hi, 
 
Can anyone answer that question, it's odd, every evening I'm full of hope, eg: tomorrow I will do this and that and be proactive, next morning, step out of bed into a pre dug hole. 
 
Regards

I’m wondering if anything similar has occured for people with high-functioning depression such as myself.
None of my family have noticed anything about my illness, despite both my parents having psychology degrees. None of my friends noticed anything either.
I had a counsellor at uni, she was lovely, I think she is the only person who believes that I am really struggling right now. She got me to fill out this rubric/checklist thingy and it came out that I was extremely severely anxious, extremely severely stressed and extremely severely depressed. I literally could not have scored any higher.
When I gave my GP this form he just said ‘It looks like you were having a bad day’. BAD DAY? SERIOUSLY? This is my life always!!
I’d been asking for ages for a mental health care plan, and he only gave me one after my uni counsellor wrote him a letter, and I could tell he was pretty reluctant. I still don’t think he thinks I’m doing that badly.
not to mention, when I finally worked up the courage to let my friends know what was going on they were so surprised! And they’d say stuff like ‘you seem fine’ or ‘you’re not that bad right?’
And at this point I just find it ridiculous. How bad do I have to be before people start taking me seriously? How can it be that I struggle with severe depression and anxiety and NO ONE around me believes me?
Sorry I know this is a bit of a rant. I just wanna know if I’m the only one this has happened to

I’m pretty sure I’m not the only depressed person who experiences this, and I would love some advice.
 I’m always bored. Always, always, always. None of the things I used to like bring me any enjoyment, such as baking, writing, painting, reading. In fact, they honestly make me more depressed because I know they aren’t working to make me happy.
i’ve tried doing new activities, old activities. I’ve tried spending more time with friends and family, I’ve tried doing nice things for people, still doesn’t improve my mood. 
The only thing that helps is sleeping, because then at least I’m not concious and not having to deal with my constant terrible mood. Unfortunately my GP has advised against me napping so much and I know in my heart he is right, it doesn’t help.
This is real hard to explain to anyone who hasn’t experienced depression, but basically it is the most terrifying thing ever when nothing can bring you joy, because you feel like you’ll be miserable forever.
I would love to know if anyone else has experienced this and what you do to deal with it.

Hey everyone,

This is my first post -- I'm hoping someone has been in the same position. So, a bit over a year ago I started to get insomnia, waking up too early every day and not being able to get back to sleep (waking up somewhere between 2-5am). After about 6 weeks of this, I started to feel in a really low mood and felt upset in the morning for no reason (apart from the tiredness). My wife suggested I go see the GP and he said it sounded like I have depression and referred me to a psychologist. The sessions were fine, I felt good afterwards for a few hours, but after 5-6 sessions felt like it wasn't helping me. So, I went back to the GP and he prescribed anti-depressants to try help out with the insomnia, this was in January.

I put off taking them until about 2 months ago (August), the reason being is I tried some supplements in January that helped me feel quite a bit better and cut down on my irritability. For 6+ months I had many days at work where I couldn't do anything but I still went into the office. My brain refused to function because of what I thought was tiredness, but was likely a combination of tiredness and depression. I let my boss know that I'd been diagnosed with depression and he was very understanding and said I can take off time as needed.

The thing is, it's not like I'm permanently depressed, I only feel terrible for at most 2 days in a row, then have a couple of really good days then return to depression and repeat. I have a feeling that my good days may be a little too good, I tend to take on a heap of projects, have lots of ideas, feel really optimistic and confident about everything, buy more stuff for my hobbies, but then a day or two later I sink back into a struggling depression. Thinking back, I've always been kind of like this, it makes me wonder if I have a mood disorder that includes depression.

Anyway, now I'm seeing a new psych and think I'll stay with him for the long haul until I get to the bottom of this, but I'm wondering if I should ask my GP for a psychiatrist referral since the medication doesn't seem to be working, in fact I think it may be making things worse. Does anyone have any suggestions or a similar experience?

Thanks for reading. In case you're wondering, this is one of my good days :)

Hi, my name is Paul, I'm 32 and I just don't know how to keep doing...THIS anymore

I've been battling depression and anxiety since I was 13 and in the last year everything has just gotten so much harder, or feels like it. I struggle to sleep and when I do sleep I struggle to wake up, i hurt everywhere and I just think I cant do this again, how am I going to get through another day of this hell.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal, I don't think about ending my life, although sometimes I wish I just won't wake up, but I couldn't do that to the people I care about.

It just hurts so much.

I live with my mum and my nan and I feel so useless to them. I'm unemployed and I have been for years and even though I'm looking for work, I keep sabortaging myself because my anxiety over working leaves me a crippled mess, I can't even get my lisence because I'm scared of driving. And lately I just can't stop stressing over the future. My nan's not in great shape and I'm stressed about what's going to happen to her and then I start to stress about what I'm going to do when I no longer have mum, and then I feel so selfish because my life pretty much revolves around them and I dont want to lose them, even though I know its inevitable. I feel like a helpless child trapped in a man's body, wandering through endless tunnel of heavy blackness and I dont know which way I'm going anymore and there's no one. Don't even really have any friends to turn to as the few that I do have do even live in this country.

Even now I'm a sobbing wreck and nearly hyperventilating, my hands are shaking so much. I just don't know what to do. I cant even remember the last time I was actually happy and not just pretending to get through the day.. I'm so lost....

I am 50 with pretty much a life-long history of chronic depression that went undiagnosed until around the early-'00s when I was prescribed medication. This was boosted to higher dosages over the years. I eventually decreased the dosage myself. Last year I knocked it back even lower, then started taking it every alternate day, then every 3rd, then early on this year I stopped completely. I did all this by myself without any medical supervision.
So I have been ~6 months or so free of any anti-depressant medication but I am still suffering real bad. Constant suicidal/death thoughts, constant bleak depressive moods, constant stress & anxiety, etc. I feel I am in a heaps worse place than I was when I first started on the damn things.
I guess I would like to hear from others in similar situations, who have withdrawn from long-term anti-depressant medication. After 6 months should I still be consumed by this mental turmoil?
Is it possible that long-term use of this pill has left me permanently damaged and I should just accept that this is the way I am from here on?
The very last thing I want is to go back onto it. If I did that, I would be hating myself. So it's a no-win situation, really.
I feel I am without any help whatsoever. I've been through GPs, counsellors, psychs, case workers. Sure, having someone to chat to helps a bit, but this crap isn't going away. I'm trying my hardest to shake this thing but I'm not getting anywhere. On bad days I am house-bound, unable to go to the shops or anything. It's almost like an altered state of consciousness.
I guess I am really desperate here, and just reaching out to see if anyone here is in a similar situation.
Do I have any legal recourse? I mean, if this medication has actually damaged me somehow, what are my options there?

So I have been in a 12 years relationship, my ex husband is defence so we have moved around a lot and he went away alot for work. I have struggled with depression for years and constantly had a feeling of abandonment every time hubby went away. I had a long string of reckless bad decisions when he was away which we got through. But 18months ago I finally went on medication to help my depressive mood and feelings of suicide.
Since going on the medication I felt numb and had this awful feeling of not sure whether I loved my husband. After he was away for 8months I had a massive panic attack and broke up with him. A week later I was finally diagnosed with bipolar. I started new medication and felt great but had this massive guilt and regret because I left my husband who I infact love with everything I have. This was 3 weeks ago.
Since then we moved to Canberra which is his hometown. I dont know anybody here and the first weekend we got here he went to sydney to stay with his ex. We were still in a hotel so nothing for me and the girls to do!? He doesnt understands bipolar and over that weekend I had a massive setback. Begged him to come back to me and our 2 kids. Was bedridden and then ended up punching a wall and telling him how selfish and unloving he was. Screamed and said some disgusting things to him. I came off all social media and hid away in the hotel with the girls.
My question is how do I explain that certain things he does makes me react badly. Is there any chance we could mend this? We have slept together 3 times in the last week. I feel like he loves me still but just finds my history too hard. Should I just move on and let him find happiness?
Help! 😔

My Mom was cheated on when i was in year 9 and my mom was pregnant with my youngest sister. i have 4 siblings i am the second oldest and and oldest daughter. 
I am the type of person who has this super bright personality, always has a smile on their face as if i have the most perfect family and my life is this magical place. Everyone who knows me says how am i so super cheerful and bright. Everyone thinks i have everything going good for me. But it's not. My family isn't perfect, I'm nothing near happy and cheerful. Im broken and no one can see it. I'm hurt and no one, not even my mom knows it. she sees me as a rebel, someone who has bad friends and is influenced by them. whereas i don't do anything stupid. i don't party, i don't drink, i don't do shisha, i don't smoke, NOTHING! My older brother is praised by mom for being the best son, not saying he isn't but i am constantly told I'm so useless, i'm not even a proper girl. i don't do the house work, i don't listen, i talk back a lot, I'm just not a daughter she hoped to have.
But i always tried my best in everything i did. i look after my 3 younger siblings as if they are my own children, since i was 7 i bathed, fed, changed their diapers. But it's nothing.  I am 18 right now, and no matter what i do my mom always finds a fault in it. 
This has ruined my relationship with my mom. we can't talk without even arguing. in a day we at least have an argument. Since my dad has left i always felt like my mom loves my brother more. its like not even a subtle hint anymore, she openly shows it. if i do a mistake and he does the same, im confronted and yelled at right then and there. whereas my brother is off the hook. 
And the worst part is i have my exams coming up and i when i tell her i cant do anything because i'm stressed and your always calling me to do chores i cant concentrate. she says so does your brother so you got to do it. 
every night im crying to sleep and just thinking i should just run away and  leave the house. No one cares about me, they wouldnt even care. my mom doesn't even want me, she has her precious son.  I have even packed my bags multiple times just to leave but i just cant seem to make the move. 
I don't know how to control my anger
i don't know how to express what i'm feeling to my mom
i don't know how to concentrate on my exams 
i just recently went to a psychiatrist and i still feel lost and alone.
i feel fake, like someone who has this mask on everyday so everyone is pleased.

Hi All,
For a long time now, I have started to feel so many emotions that I just can’t control. 
- Jealousy 
- really bad indecisiveness with everything from work down to what I eat
- (so morbid) death in my family as a member is currently unwell. Or being broken into etc. 
- extreme ups and low downs 
- my attitude can change after someone says something I don’t like or agree with
- overthinking and reading into things
- low confidence on knowledge that I know
- low labido
- feel like a failure
- social awkwardness 
- loss of energy and motivation 
- wanting to change my Appearance 
- want to be alone but then I don’t 
can someone point me in the right direction. I’m lost!

That felt like too long of a title so I really hope someone can help me out or give some advice.
This is only my second post ever so excuse the display name I made when I was 18...
The biggest challenge I am currently facing now is the horrible manifestations of my depressive stage. Being bipolar is somewhat of a blessing and a curse, the highs of hypomania and mania can be the greatest yet fleeting moments of my life. I have always been artistic with both music and drawing. And for a long time I have hoped to one day be a tattooist. 
Ive been married for over a year and a half now, and my partner and I have been trying to have our first child for a few months now with no luck so far. I have a relatively stable job with average pay, but my wife still earns more. I've lost a lot of money over the years buying multiple cars that all broke down beyond repair. Financially we are mostly stable, we save what we can but we both have debts and bills to pay so it's a slow saving.
Now for the real issue. It roughly started around the time I had a motorbike accident in 2017. I shattered the cartilage behind my kneecap and it's something that will never heal. After many misdiagnoses I was diagnosed bipolar 1 only a few months after the accident. This finally explained the struggles I've been going through for years. I am currently well medicated and ""mostly"" stable. But I have also been on fluctuating amounts of opioid and antinflamattory medications for my constant pain.
Theres a high chance I have fibromyalgia, as my mum developed it recently post-surgery. The pain medications only take away the real physical pain and not the complete body pain that's basically ""all in my head"". I've really been struggling the last month managing my pain. I take as much and as many meds as I can for both the pain and my mental state which is slowly deteriorating. I'm fairly certain that with the meds I take for my bipolar there isn't much I can take or do for fibromyalgia and that scares me. I'm scared of a life dependant on opioids, which the more of I take the higher chance I go into mania or psychosis. The opioids really do help and I don't think I could function without them. I also don't want to be on them forever especially as I'm trying to start a family. I take enough pills as it is and these are the ones I both love and need, yet don't want.
The strain on my marriage is showing as I don't tell my wife the full extent of my struggle and fears
is there anyone who can help?

Hey everybody,
I finally competed my electrical apprenticeship after 5 years. It's great that I managed to finish however I am more depressed than ever. 
I have to say that doing an apprenticeship was probably one of my worst decisions I have ever made. I lost my job 3 times and worked the most tediously long hours (20 hour days were quite common) it destroyed me. My body is shot, I have next to no financial results, or gained any good contacts and networks to peruse this path further.
If I see another cable or even a light switch it makes me shudder. I have literally tortured myself for 5 years with everyone around me encouraging me to finish it, and now that I have, I simply look back with regret. I hate the work, the people and the environment I was surrounded with everyday.
I can't even do the job now without getting extremely angry and frustrated (not a good look for employers or clients). A simple cable run not going right will cause me to fume like nothing else.
I have worked many jobs and gained skills prior, as a network architect and a telecommunicatuons technician. I am now 33 years old and once again I have persued a career which I eventually hated with every fibre of my being.
My depression has become debilitating. I don't leave the house anymore unless really necessary. I have lost all my friends, and don't even do things with my wife and kids. My brother lives next door but never speak to him. I think he's given up on me too. 
I am unemployed and can't bring myself to look for work. The thought of being around people makes me want to die. Life seems so exhausting when people are involved and work is about people, either cooperating with or doing things for them. 
I really need to find a career I can tolerate. But there is nothing that pays for you to simply exist. And quite frankly existing is feeling lile work at the moment.
I am slipping further down the rabbit hole everyday.
I do realise the irony of complaining about people generally whilst attempting to reachout to people.

Hi,
I’m new to this and have not been able to open up about the extent of my depression openly to anyone close to me. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and I feel fine for a little while but then I come crashing down again. It just feels like it’s getting more frequent and every episode is getting worse. My husband is aware I’m having problems but I just lash out at him and nothing I say seems to make sense. 
I feel so guilty all the time and I hate myself so much for not being happy. I just don’t feel worthy of this life. I have spent so many years making sure everyone and everything around me was ok but it’s like I was just hiding behind this image so no one would see how broken I am. I can’t keep up the image anymore everything just feels too hard. I haven’t left my room for 3 days. I want to spend time with my children but don’t have the energy pull myself together. This feeling of guilt feels like it’s eating me up. I feel like an embarrassment to my husband and daughters. It’s like I am dragging them all down with me or by being with them. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to feel better. I can’t remember the last time I laughed

In the lateness of the night, I am startled by noise and din 
There -- just outside the window, Shadow is vying to get in. 
He sees me and I see him, I know my time is nigh, 
Shadow is a coming, there is no where to hide. 

I close the doors, and lock the sash, and pray with all my might, 
but Shadow comes right through the glass, to punish me tonight. 
He fills my head with anguish, I shudder with despair. 
Tells me life is crap, and death would be more fair. 

All that remains is solitude; I shield my soulless, saddened eyes. 
I'm lacking love, respect and gratitude; in a world that's filled with lies. 
My children are still growing up, their lives have just begun. 
So I tell Shadow to go away, my race has not yet run. 

At times like this he torments me, and talks about the end, 
but in my heart I know he jests, for Shadow is my friend. 
Shadow may be appear evil, malignant and very bad 
however there are those times, when he allows me to be glad. 

Shadow lets me celebrate, with kids, on their birthdays 
and to make them happy at special times, like Easter and Christmas day. 
As long as I remember, it's for their happiness and not for mine 
Shadow won't punish me, and everything will be fine. 

Sometimes I wish Shadow gone, and hope he'd forget me,   
but then I would be truly alone.... 

I am lost.

Hi, 
 
It's been a while since I've posted anything. Years, in fact. Yet I feel like I've gone nowhere.
I've been seeing a psychologist every week for the past 6 months. Today was my last session for a while and I feel like I've gotten nowhere. I'm starting to think maybe I've done something wrong. Is this normal? I have a lot going on in my life at the moment so I understand that part of what I feel is caused by situational things. However, there's a large part that isn't. I don't know whether I haven't tried hard enough to get better? Or whether this is just a feeling that I'm going to have to accept for the foreseeable future? I suppose it's hard to accept that maybe happiness isn't for me... especially after so long of trying to achieve it. 
I suppose I'm writing here, to feel a little less alone in this. Have others come out the other side of endless psychologist and psychiatrist etc. appointments and felt like they're still where they started? What else can I possibly do? 
I'm feeling a little hopeless with it at the moment. I just keep turning up with questions that seem to have no answers. When does this merry go round stop?

I have an incredibly understanding partner but when I have these episodes he can’t do anything to pull me out.

So this is possibly the first time making a thread, I’m looking for some advice on something.
some background information, I have had depression for along time now and for the past 4 years I have been slowly recovering from a series of negative life events.
i am on medication and see a psychologist quarterly, as such I won’t see her anytime soon to ask her the questions I have.
i haven’t had a proper job in the past 4 year and I expect to experience some issues in returning to work, I recently had a 3 day assignment of hard laborious work. By midday I was ready to give up and go home, however I stuck out the full day.
the following two days I called in sick because of my depression, I think that I pushed myself to much and didn’t have the energy levels remaining to overcome my depression. 
My question is more about understanding the connection between my depression and the hard work preformed, assuming they are indeed related.

Hi,
I'm 17 and I'm pretty sure I have really bad depression. My HSC exams start in a little over 2 weeks, and I'm struggling to get in the mood to study, as some mornings, and during the day, I just feel sad. It's sort of like an emptiness? I'll just sit on the floor of my room feeling like throwing or punching something, if I get annoyed, and then cry. It was like that today. My mum came into my room and just pointed at my study timetable that's hanging on my wall, and didn't leave until I moved to get up off my bed.
As soon as she left, I had the sudden urge to peg something at a wall or hit something, and when I got to my desk and turned on my laptop to start studying, I burst into tears. The weird thing is, that it'll just stop, and then start later on. 
I feel hopeless, it's as though I can never get out of this never-ending circle of sleep, eat, study, sleep, eat, study, and I'm sick of it. I've talked to my doctor a little about it, and she wants to wait until I finish the HSC, to see if it'll continue, or if it's just a phase because of the huge amount of stress. It's really hard to concentrate right now because I feel like I'm about to burst into tears at any given moment.
My mum knows about my depression-like behaviour and says that I should do more things that I enjoy, but I feel as though I don't have the time anymore, and never did or will. I really enjoy listening to music, colouring in and writing my own stories, but if I listen to music I'll get easily distracted, and the other 2 just take up time that I feel I need for study. It's the same with my friends, as I haven't really been able to talk to them much throughout the year, as I've moved schools, and I just feel really lonely and secluded.
I don't know what to do.

Hi there,
I have suffered from depression and anxiety for many years. I finally got to a point where I needed to start antidepressants. After some initial side effects, I started feeling great. It's now been 8 weeks and I'm finding myself more depressed than before. It all seems to have changed within a week and I feel low most of the time. I don't understand how it changed so quickly. Any advice or experience from someone who has been through this would be great. 
thanks!

Hi
I've suffered from Depression, Anxiety & Complex PTSD for a long time. I've been in treatment for the past 4 years.
I've taken multiple medications, engaged in a number of talk therapies, had a round of ETC, and continually tried to implement all the strategies I've been given. I'm 29, eat healthily, exercise at least a few times a week, maintain a full time job, get involved in fundraisers and help at my church, try to socialise with others and invest in my friends and families lives and have an outward, grateful focus. 
But I'm still struggling every day. Some things have helped somewhat over time, but nothing has had a lasting effect and I'm feeling really desperate and exhausted. I can't focus or think clearly, forget things, feel overwhelmed by simple things and by intrusive thoughts that I find hard to ignore, get anxious and have panic attacks and feel so low and despairing and just wrong. 
I don't know what to do. I'm trying my best to stay for my family & friends, but something has to change. I wish I was strong enough to just live with these symptoms and thoughts, but I just don't think I am. 
Does anyone have any suggestions on what I could try? Any ideas would be so appreciated.

Im a 28yo female with diagnosed bpd. I've been off ""sick"" for a week and a half now.
Usually when I have these down periods I come back after one day feeling a bit better. Sometimes it takes much longer.
It has gotten to the point where I'm wondering if I will ever return to my permanent part time job in childcare or simply quit. Except it's never that simple, right? If I quit I lose my study (you need to have a work placement) and I'm only 6-12 months from completing my diploma.
But the idea of 6 months, even one month mean nothing to me because I can't even get through today.
What I'd like to find out is if anyone has successfully managed working while suffering from bpd, and if anyone can not work due to the illness- how did you get government assistance, and access mental health services?
Thank you.

I don't know how to start or truly explain how I feel. I've been a stay at home father for my 2year old little girl and has been a great experience but for the last 2months I have been looking for work and having zero luck.  I'm usually a pretty carefree person but I'm really starting to get down. 
I feel worthless and not wanted,  all jobs I apply for are just constantly turning me down.  I'm 36, have worked retail management for years,  warehousing and other managment roles and do not understand why it is so hard....  I've been out of work looking after and raising my little girl for around 10months and can't help but feel this is having an impact.  I'm struggling to make ends meet and really fear for the future and the future of my little one....
Anyone faced this before that might have some ideas on how to Cope?

I can’t seem to crack the anxiety that comes with going to work and being responsible.
A little background about me. I’m 23 and have had anxiety/social anxiety/ depression for eleven years, with it’s ups and downs. At the moment it’s very down. My girlfriend of five years requires a constant income of money to pay for her student visa, and obviously needs my help, but I always let her down because I can’t bring myself to work. I’ve been on medication for a year now and I’ll still do anything to avoid the feeling that comes with going to work. I dread every single second leading up to going to work, and always end up feeling trapped and hopeless, usually resulting in tears or risking my position at work by calling in sick at the last minute, followed by a day of never ending guilt. I just can’t do it. I feel sick, tired, unable to put on a customer service mask for hours at a time. Sometimes I even hope something bad will happen to me before I have to go to work, like a car accident, or a sudden medical emergency. I’d rather be in the hospital, sick or injured, than go to work. 
I’m stuck in a place of letting my girlfriend down and being scared of my mental health deteriorating even further. I feel at peace when I know I don’t have to work, when I can deal with my depression in the comfort of my home, but working is really taking it out of me.
I haven’t already worked since late July because of my workplace being renovated, but now that’s it’s recently opened back up, I’m due to come in again. If I’m honest, I don’t know if I can handle it in the state I’m in right now. I don’t know what to do.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I live on a cattle station 500kms from the nearest town and have a 1 year old baby. As positive and easy going as I normally am, I find myself unhappy every day or struggling to cope with looking after a small child. I have no energy or motivation for anything. Now that i Am a mum all I am really able to do in terms of work is take phone calls, do bookwork and cook and clean. My partner is amazing and will turn himself inside out to help in any way he can, but has been having a hard time figuring out how to help me, his job is pretty full on on the cattle station and he is out a lot and I am alone with the baby a lot with nowhere to really go as we are so isolated. On top of this my cognitive ability and memory have seriously slipped in the past year to the point where I appear and feel like a proper dumb airhead while just recently I finished my honours in chemical engineering, am young and at the peak of my health. Does anybody have any ideas for strategies or activities that may help me get some motivation and energy happening again? Thanks in advance.

A couple of months ago, I started to feel really crap about depression. I felt alone, disgusting and unwanted. I decided to write a note to my friend explaining my situation. It took me about three days to write and have to guts to go up to him and give it to him. So we were hanging out outside. I approached him, took him to the side and told him to read it and come to me when he was finished. I walked off and regretted the decision right away. Once he was finished he came up to me and told that I was messed up and that I'm always happy so I can't have depression. He continued to deny that I was suffering and brushed it off his shoulder. Everytime I try to talk about it he just ignores it and avoids the subject. It took me another four months to attempt to tell someone else. Now I feel that I can't trust anyone and no one can help or comfort me. Does anyone have any advice or any sort of help for my situation?

Recently I have seen a psychologist to help we work on issues relating to adhd and anxiety. I've always had some level of depression but I haven't been comfortable enough to really discuss that with my psychologist yet.
Recently I had an intense period of depression which lasted 3-4 days where my mind was racing more than usual, i had some intense depressive thoughts and pretty much stayed in bed the entire time. I didn't really eat much and didn't shower during that time. 
Something similar happened a few months ago. But instead of staying in bed I was working fifo and there was a few times I burst into tears unprovoked. 
There was few times when I was working fifo where I felt that I had more energy than normal and was more productive. It was normally at the beginning of the day and I put it down to taking my adhd meds on an empty stomach or being on the wrong dose.
Are these signs of BPD or bipolar, and how do I talk to my psychologist about them? I made an appointment to see my psychologist earlier than planned during my recent depressive episode, and I feel like that was the wrong thing to do and that he will  think that I over-reacted or am attention seeking. 
I have never self harmed or attempted to take my own life, but I have had suicidal thoughts that I knew I wouldn't act on. I'm in my mid-20s.

I've been a mild depression sufferer most of my adult life. Back in early June, I quit smoking after 25 years of smoking. After a few odd weeks, my overall health and feeling of well-being was transformed - I felt amazing; for the first time in years I could breathe again, smell things, took simply pleasures in just sitting relaxing. The anxiety I now recognised as constantly hanging out for the next cigarrette was totally gone. I was so excited by how well I felt that I went to see my GP and suggested that going off the anti-depressants would be realistic for the first time in years, given more time. I'd also quit drinking alcohol on weekends and just felt a million bucks. 
I was still 'vaping' with nicotine through July, and then late July got rid of the nicotine altogether. THEN, it started. I yo-yo'd like crazy, going from overjoyed one day to miserable the next. I'd flip on a dime - I felt like my head was totally fogged up, then I'd take a walk to get lunch and an hour later feel amazing. This has been going on right through to now (Sept). I have been under stress at work, so it has been hard to interpret what has been happening, I was a bit confounded as to whether how I felt was stress related, nicotine withdrawal or both. 
Has anyone else who has quit smoking after being a smoker for a LONG time gone through this? I don't know if I'm coming or going. I want to return to the elation I felt when I first quit the cigarettes.. I was still vaping and all this back-sliding seemed to coincide with when I stopped with the nicotine/vaping altogether. I would have thought that nearly two months and I should be totally free of nictotine's grip !!!!

Hey all.
It's my first post here so here we go... So this year has been rough in terms of my depression and anxiety. I've been through a lot of heart-ache, betrayal by one of my closest friends (turned out she was using and manipulating me for her own purposes...she treated me like shit and like I was beneath her) and one of the relationships I got into with a guy - ended up with me experiencing something I thought would never happen to me... let's just say there was a slight lack of consent.. (it's too much to write it here, I can't say it sorry).
So I have realised that I use alcohol to cope with my feelings and I don't know how to cope with healthier options. I drink to feel good.. at least for awhile. I find it so hard to process things, I dont know how. I recently took a hardcore drug to help me feel good and I never thought I would reach this point.
How do you deal with your feelings? I've tried -  exercise, I have some amazing friends and a good family.. I don't know what to do.

HI
I have had depression since my teenage years, trialing many different CBT and medications. i am 26 now and self manage my depression most of the time as i react with most medications. when i was 17 i was in a relationship with someone who i ended up getting married to. i had a not so good childhood and i seemed to have had followed that abuse with my partner. we were together for 6 years in which during that time i lost my identity. we split 3 years ago and during the time of it, it was very traumatic and emotionally abusive, to the point now where my short term memory is terrible compared to what is used to be and i forget the simplest things and sometimes even what i am doing when i am in the middle of a task. financially it has been horrible to but most of that has subsided.  that is a brief over view of my history. 
last week i had a really bad episode, probably the worst i have had in a few months and i am struggling to get out. its like i am here but it doesnt feel that everything around me is real, and my mood changes dramatically with the smallest thing. i just feel so tired and i dont want to go back to a therapist or take medications as i dont find these helpful to me. i almost feel like the inside wants to just shut down. physically i feel ok but the rest of me doesnt. my spirit feels tired. any suggestions as to what people try to help themselves get better

I am not entirely sure what I’m doing here. It’s hard to find an outlet for your words where they can be heard. Because when you’re feeling like I am right now, there isn’t a single word I can utter to convey these hollowness , or even a single person who’d be willing to listen. 
Because right now, at this very moment , I am the only thing existing in this universe of mine  along with it’s great big hole. No amount of music, stories or memes can fill its ache. 
I know I’ll be fine in the morning, I think. ‘Fine’ is probably just the mask for it. Though it might be stronger in daylight. It might hold for a day or a week or even a month. But eventually it will crumble and I’ll return to my universe of one.
Even in my dark phase, I can’t use straight words to express. I need these weird images to hide behind. Who knows what my problem is. Surely not me. Maybe someone? 
Anyone?

Hi guys,
first time here, seeking personal experiences with child support and fatherhood. I currently work night shifts and have for 2 years and never see my child, I have recently been battling against depression and anxiety and have been spiraling down every day since. 
I just want to talk to someone about it all, I use to be an extrovert but lately I barely leave the house, I recently turned 27 and I look at my life compared to others my age and wonder where I went wrong with everything, I was brought up to hide emotions cause it was a weakness, which now affects my relationship with my fiancé. I snap with anger if something small and unimportant happens, I’m frustrated all the time, I’m grinding my teeth as I write this cause I don’t like help and I’m anxious over nothing!!
i give kudos to all the people out there on child support that can manage to pick themselves up. I just needed to vent mostly but any personal experience and advice is appreciated

Hello,
I have recently started my annual leave, normally this was a time I just immersed myself into online gaming and let the time tick by. This year I just didn't have that desire so I started going for bike rides and and listening to podcasts. It is weird, as I don't really listen to music, but I heard a kpop group that was great so I checked out some of their stuff and it awoke feelings that I didn't know I had. This isn't some creepy 40+ year old dude watching young asian girls for kicks, it was a revelation of sorts. Watching them on Youtube I started crying at one of their songs even though I didn't understand it. I realised these are a group of talented people who have everything in front of them, they are full of joy, they are close friends, they have the World at their feet. I have none of these things. It's not a fame and fortune thing. It's that I don't have joy in my life, I have no friends. I haven't had a relationship in forever. Who would want a boyfriend that has no friends? I don't know if any of this is relevant but as the Catalyst of my discovery I though worth mentioning. 
Anyway I decided to reach out to two people from my past who where still in my phone, we used to work together and were pretty close but It has been years. They both messaged me very quickly and one called and we spoke for a bit and said we would catch up. I'm just not sure how to proceed. I would love to chat but I don't want to be the person who suddenly tries to force his way into others lives, especially after so long,  and I don't think it is right to be using these people to try and fix my issues. It's just that I finally want friends but have no idea how to achieve that at 45, who wants to be friends with someone who has none? How do you even meet people when you don't have friend's to hang around with? My job involves weird shift work, start and finish times are different everyday and I often work weekends so I would like to rekindle these friendships before I get back to work. 
  I'm thinking of going to see a professional to help me sort through things as I am currently a bundle of emotions instead of not caring like I did for the last 10 years.
Thanks for reading and any input. I really has helped to sit down and write this out, even though i'm crying like a kid. I guess I do need to do something more. I don't know how people do this, I've read so many articulate posts, so sorry for mine.

I am waking each morning worrying about just making it through the day! I've been on medication and feel it's not working although I've made small improvements.
I just hate waking up seeing the sunlight and thinking here we go again.
No suicide ideation at all but sick and tired of being sick and tired! Also tapering from anxiety medication. I also have health and GAD anxiety on top of the depression and medical professionals involved. I'm not into craft or arts or anything. Prior to all this I enjoyed going out even though I lived a little reckless! I'm just over waking each morning feeling like this even though I'm using all my CBT tools. Ahhhhhh

Hi everyone!
My name's Naomi. I've lived with anxiety and depression for years but just recently been diagnosed with (and have probably always had) Borderline Personality Disorder. Would be nice to meet and connect with people who experience what I do.
Even though I share a lot with others I still feel very alone sometimes, especially since I'm recently diagnosed with BPD, and I'd love to have a community of people I'm not 'running' so to speak. I look forward to meeting people on here  :)
Have a good evening everyone

Hi this is my first post on here, i'm not sure if i'm meant to be introducing myself or not. This is a little bit confronting for me as i have difficulties discussing this at all. But I really feel like i need to be able to share this & maybe have somebody who cares enough to listen. I feel like it could do me a lot of good.

To introduce myself a little, I've struggled with depression & nightmares for 6 years now, the year that I graduated from high school I began to feel extremely isolated. I had no one to talk to, I had no idea at all what i wanted in life & no real life skills. 

Without any idea what i wanted in life I kind of gambled on an interest i had at the time & jumped into a fitness Degree. This unfortunately turned out to be a horrible idea as my problems with Social skills really hit hard & inevitably caused me to fail leaving me $3,600 in debt with an entire year wasted with nothing to show for it as well as angering my parents enough that i was kicked out of home. For the next 2 years i bounced between degrading casual jobs, with no friends or family to support me what so ever.

3 years after graduating I finally made another friend, who later went on to become my girlfriend. Having her in my life led me to so much advancement in my life, I got an enjoyable well paying job, paid my debt back to my parents & made amends & overall felt significantly happier. Though for the past year since then I started to feel that same old sadness coming back, looking at my life I'd think to myself none of this is what i want. This was true for almost everything. However i told myself i was okay because I thought I at least had a partner for life & that was 1 thing that made me genuinely happy. 

Anyways, 3 months ago we broke up & this led us to stop talking as a whole. In that time i hadn't made any more friends & with her gone that 1 shred of happiness that remained is gone. I'm now stuck in what i feel to be a worst position than I ever have been before, I do not enjoy any of my previous hobbies anymore, I go to work & honestly feel like i struggle to not break down while I'm there now & every night i go to bed unable to sleep for hours because i am unable to stop thinking about how much i miss her.

Im not particularly sure how to wrap this up. But for all those who have read & might have say something to say, thankyou so much for giving me your time. I apologise for how incoherent this probably comes across to read.

Hi guys,
I am feeling increasingly anxious about not being liked at work.  I know that depression can cloud our thinking but I also think I am quite perceptive so I am not sure if I am right to feel this way or not.  I am middle aged and for a while I was mostly working with younger people (although now it's more of a mixed team), and finding it difficult to connect.  I feel like I always say the wrong thing, even when I am genuinely trying to be nice, I feel that people think I am being patronising.  One particular colleague is super smart and is always praised by our manager and I honestly feel inadequate.  He is really nice and helpful to everyone but when I ask for help he either doesn't help me or says things like : 'Oh really, you don't know that?' in an arrogant tone.  Now I feel like I am constantly replaying what I say in my head and worrying about what other people must be thinking.  My anxiety is on the rise and depression usually follows.  I don't know what to do.  I am on medication but it's only ever just taken the edge off.  I don't think I have truly felt happy and well for the longest time. I also see a counsellor and we have tried CBT and mindfulness.  Just right now I am really struggling and I need to know if other people experience this sort of thing and how they cope. I'd be grateful for any thoughts  on this thanks.

I am new to this, but I am struggling. My dear friend, who is in a deep state of depression, just asked me to no longer communicate with him because he feels it is imperative that he singularly focus on a new relationship with someone he met and fell deeply in love with. He says that he is not able to have any friendship while he focuses on trying to make this work. We have been friends for many years, and there is a great amount of trust and respect between us, but I am not certain what to do, or what to expect, if anything, from this relationship going forward. he has had ups and downs over the course of our friendship, but he was seriously suffering for the last year. He has never found any clinician who he has been able to work with, and he is not taking any medication that I am aware of. 
I want to think that this is great news for him, and that he has found a partner who can help him, but I want to better understand if this is any sort of warning sign. I believe that I am one of the few, if not the only person in his life who is aware of what is going on, and I was not able to help him much. I think that out of respect, I want to honor his request, but I just don't know if this is what I should be doing.  Is it reasonable for me to think that it is a positive step forward for him to suddenly fall deeply in love when he is clinically depressed without treatment?
He was very clear in his request for no more communication of any kind from me. He said that he needed some sort of finality with me (we are only friends as mutually agreed upon), so that he could singularly focus himself on this new relationship. He said that this woman has been so directly good for him, and that she continues to be, every day. It sounds like this could be just what he needs.
Since I was not able to really help him, and she seems to be able to, is it safe for me to leave it at that?  There was no upset or bad moment (he was mostly sad and reserved, but there were no emotional outbursts or anger at that time) between us when I saw him last a few weeks ago, so I figure that if all is as he says, this is a good thing. I figure that if he needs to reach out to me, we have been friends long enough for him to know that he could do that. Does this sound reasonable?

I have been struggling with anxiety for a while, and it’s getting worse & I’m very depressed.
I’m getting help by seeing a counsellor each fortnight but it doesn’t seem to be helping and I feel like I’m spiraling out of control. 
I recently had a work event & was internally upset at my best friend of 2.5 years (work mate) for spending more time with other girls, because I felt un-cool and not good enough for her (something I have been feeling for a while, due to anxiety). I ended up unfollowing her on Instagram when I shouldn’t have. She found out & told me since that these incidents happen too often (I have had anxiety before and unintentionally lashed out when I shouldn’t have - I never mean to and regret it so much). 
She said that she doesn’t know how to help me, and that I need help but she doesn’t think we can be friends anymore. 
My depression has got worse over the weekend, to the point where I won’t go into work tomorrow because I won’t be able to focus. I’m so upset about losing a friend and I feel like my world is coming to an end - I relied on her so much. I’m having some really dark thoughts & feel like the worst person in the world to lose such a beautiful friend when I never meant to. 
One work friend is really concerned about me and told me that she wants to tell someone at work so I can take some time off. I know that is probably a good idea, but I wouldn’t want to take time off unless I could see my parents and stay with them (they live overseas & I live with flatmates). 
However my parents are going on a 5 week holiday across the world on Wednesday, something that they deserve so much and I don’t want to take that away from them. My work friend said that my parents would come to see me over their trip, as they’d regret it if something happened to me while they’re gone (my parents know how I’m feeling and are very concerned). However I feel terrible ruining their holiday and the thought of doing that is making it even worse, even though I know I probably have to.
I don’t have many friends and I don’t know what to do. I feel like my life is spiralling out of control. I need some help.

Lately I have been struggling with some very new emotions. I have been feeling constantly down/sad as well as rapid change of emotions and huge reactions over little things. If anyone has any ideas of what this may be or anyways to help it would be much appreciated.

 I like to share my problems and hope someone will listen and give me some thoughts on it. Knowing that it’s not going to solve the problem. At least I can release my emotion a bit. 
i was diagnosed with moderate to severe depression and anxiety all at once after doing the depression screen in late July. It was like a sudden heart attack.  I could not believe the fact that i need to start taking antidepressant as well as seeing a psychologist.  It’s such a mental health problem.  I feel so ashamed to tell my husband about the condition. I wear a mask everyday pretending I am ok.   I also wonder if I would ever recover. I had struggled for 10 days to finally get to a chemist to get the drug as after days of depression and unsleepless. It was a real torture!  The antidepressant indeed has improved my sleeping. I started the first session with a psychologist last week, however not very useful!  I told myself to think everything in a positive way and I will be ok.   Last week, I decided to come off the drug although the psychologist warned me that it would take  6 full weeks for the antidepressant to come effect. I am not sure if its a good idea to stop now.  But I only had drugs for 20 days. I do not want to rely on it to make me sleep! Everyday I feel so depressed and so tired. Expression has psuhed away my motivation and I found that everything I do is an effort.  I don’t want to meet people.  
 My brain has focused so much on negative thoughts.  any idea how to change or divert my negative thoughts!

I'm not after support as such right now; I just wanted to share what happened to me this weekend, because a lot of it was new to me. 
I'm going through a heavy-drinking-at-home-on-weekends phase to deal with boredom and loneliness. (I know that's a terrible reason to drink.. I'm going to just cut it out altogether for a month or two starting today.) I was feeling relaxed and comfortable enough last night to check in with my ex on social media. She's just had a baby with her new partner, and given it the same name she and I had chosen for our prospective kids.. ouch! Anyway, some part of me knew exactly when she was due and it had been hanging over me, so I'm glad it's happened, and that I saw the baby photos at a time of my choosing, rather than having them pop up unexpectedly. 
This morning I was pretty wobbly and thought I'd perk myself up with a couple of strong coffees. Unfortunately the cafe was playing Amy Winehouse's Back to Black, which is a) my ex's favourite song; b) about a devastating breakup and coping by drug abuse; c) by someone who had a heartbreaking life and died far too young. 
The whole thing tipped me into a full-scale panic attack, the worst I've ever had. My parents dropped around with a care package (I'm in my early 40s, but I ain't too proud to turn down free homecooked food!) and talked about potplants. Trying to distract me with smalltalk when I'm trying to avoid being crushed by the elephant in the room. It was a disaster and I almost told them to leave. I broke the family taboo on admitting to mental illness, which is causing me a lot of (undeserved) shame. But they did offer to drive me to a national park, where I walked by myself for a few hours. It's nice - there's a lot of wildlife, flowers, other walkers to say hello to - and movement and nature (and a couple of benzo tablets) were exactly what I needed. I called my parents once I'd calmed down and explained how to better support me if/when that happens again.
I finished the day with a (non-dodgy) massage, to ease the loneliness through physical contact. And now I'm back on an even keel.
Lessons?
* Just don't drink
* Organise Friday and Saturday night social activities in advance
* I'm gradually developing intuitions about self-care, which is a good step
* Being witnessed to is a powerful need. My parents' mis-step completely broke me.

Sorry I am in a weird mood.  But I've come to the realisation that life isn't going to get any better.  My life's not terrible, but I have never really achieved anything, that I can say is my own.  I'm stuck in retail, something I have been in since I was 17.  I have ever wanted to do was study.  Unfortunatly I am not intelligent enough for this considering no matter how hard I work I usually behind everyone in terms of grades and understanding.  Most of my schooling invovled extra tutition because I was so slow and stupid.  Studying overseas (course to study in Greece - archeology) not an option my grades weren't good enough.  Didn't get in to study Masters, cause I was according to a potional supervisor too stupid (that was the most painful email of my life).  
 I have had to watch everyone I know get better jobs and better grades.  I moved from NZ to Australia because I was unemployeed.  I even tried to go back to Uni to study info management but only to fail, again.  How do I just accept that I'm staring at 40, and all I good for putting things through a checkout.  Once you have retail on your CV that is it, you are good at nothing else. Just soft skills nothing concret.   No matter how much I have volenteered not matter what else I have tried or applyed for.  It doesn't any better.  Why am I this usless? I feel like I am running out of options.  How do I just accept that it is not going to change and I am just slow and stupid.  Because I don't want to be me anymore.  I hate being in the same room as myself.

I have two assignments each due over a week ago but I still can't focus. Also feeling a lot of self hate to do with this procrastination.

Hi all.
Ive suffered depression for many many years. Lately it has reared its ugly head again due to some marriage issues I’m having. I’ve got that sensation again where I am detached from the world. Like I am walking around in a dream and feel like there’s a screen between me and everyone else... I know there’s a word for this feeling. I believe it’s called derealisation. I was just curious as to how many of you suffer from the same thing and when does is tend to dissipate? Thank you.

Hi everyone,
I suffer from major depression and thankfully have been pretty well and managed my condition with medication and therapy over the last couple of months, but with any mental illness come days when you don't feel so good and sometimes just need to take a sick day off work.
So my problem now is that over the last 2 weeks i needed 3 days off for my mental health (not consecutive days) and after coming back my boss made me feel that my mental illness made me weak and basically tried to make me take leave for an extended period to get better. At first i tried to make her understand that i just needed so those days of so i could re-focus and feel mentally better in my self  and that i don't need extended leave. She then stated that if i felt that i needed mental health days off that i was maybe in the wrong career and needed a job with less stress. This made so angry as i thought Mental health awareness was getting better and still not so stigmatized in workplaces bu sadly i was wrong. 
so my question for everyone is what do you say or do when you need that day off for mental health, do we need to go backwards and make an excuse of an illness just so we will not judged. I work as a nurse and absolutely love it, but feel so let down in the one industry i hoped would be more understanding of mental illness.

Lately I've been feeling more and more emotionless, lifeless, lonely, afraid. It's got to the point where I can't trust anyone in my life, I dont want anyone in my life, I just want my life to end or at the very least to be secluded from the world so I can just do what I want to do alone. 
Lately  I seem to be pushing everyone away, some who deserve it and some who dont. But I dont know any other way to be.
 
When I was 10 I was diagnosed with bipolar, would love to know the doctor's reasoning behind that. I refused medication up until I was about 19, claiming medications would change me. And they did.
I turned to medications about 5 years after hearing a voice that wasn't there, was a one time occurance and I believe it was largely due to my drink being spiked at a music festival a few days before I hear it.
The medication made me unbearably sleepy, I was sleeping more than half the day for the first few weeks which wasn't too bad as I was unemployed at the time. But now, my body depends on it to get to sleep, if i dont have it I'll literally be awake for days but if I do have it I'll still sleep deeply and for at least 9 hours. I wasnt like that before. I had no issues with sleeping before.
 
Part of me now just wants to stop the medication because all it's doing to me is putting me to sleep of a night. It's been the past few years that I've been feeling increasingly emotionless. The medication doesn't help it.
 
I just dont know what to do with myself now. I dont trust my ""family"". I dont trust my doctor. I dont have a psychiatrist or psychologist anymore. I'm pushing my one friend away. I feel unbelievably terrified that my son will turn out like me, an emotionless angry hateful little person who wishes the world would disappear.
 
I know I need help, theres 19 years worth of issues I need help with and I just dont know where to go or where to start. Whenever I have opened up to people they just tell me to grow up, show more respect to the people who've assaulted me, or they just aren't interested. The only thing I feel I can open up to now is being anonymous on a website, and my diary. I dont know how to talk to people anymore, I dont know how to be a normal functioning person because I'm just dead inside.

I feel so so alone. I've had depression and anxiety ever since I was 11 but I could always get through the bad days because I had family and friends to support me. I am now 22 and its been 5 years since I left high school. Pretty much immediately I lost all of my friends through fights which mainly revolved around my depression and anxiety - me always bringing them down, or not going out with them due to anxiety or acting like the victim if I wanted to share my feelings. It took me a lot of time to kind of get over it, but it hurts to know they are all still friends and its as if I never existed. To make it worse, I've been at uni for 4 years and have not made one friend... I don't know what's wrong with me. Everyone around me in my year are great friends, inviting each other to parties etc. I have no one to talk to but my partner and I can't always rely on him. I am getting married next year in April and I'm not even excited, I'm depressed because I don't have any friends going, and the people that were so important in my life that I would've wanted there won't be because we aren't in each others lives anymore. I have tried to fix things and catch up but they refuse... Obviously something is wrong with me. I feel I will always experience this loneliness, always struggle to make and keep friends. 
My family is normally my everything. My sisters are normally my best friends but for some reason lately we have grown distant. The 3 of them hang out together, talk to each other at family events and complain about me. Tonight was a family thing, and I sat on the couch alone for 6 hours... without interaction. I eventually broke down and left. My nieces and nephews don't even say hi to me or want to hug or play with me - only with my other sisters. I think it is because I've been more honest lately, because they treat me like crap majority of the time and only talk to me when they need me, for example, to babysit so I guess I haven't stood for it lately. I'm always being bullied in the family, even by brother in laws. They say really horrible things, but whenever I am honest or stand up for myself I get yelled at or called mean. I can never win or be myself anymore. How can I live on when even my own family dislikes me. How can I make friends when my own family dislikes me. I would never harm myself, trust me. I couldn't do that to my Mum or partner. I just needed to talk. I am normally such a fighter, but I have lost all the fight within me. Idk what to do.

I have a place to live, a car to drive, a job, regular income. Isn’t that all the things I didn’t have before that was what I wanted to get my life back. Well I got all those things but I’m going through life just living. Doing what I have to to get through each day. 

I’ve stuck to what I was told to do and disassociated with old friends but I can feel my depression pulling me back under. I’m so lonely. I’m so alone. I’m lost in life still when I’m not at work. It’s all well and good to talk about meeting people, but it’s not that easy.
This life isn’t the life I wanted. It isn’t fun living like this and feeling this way. 
I really do feel like I’ve tried my best. I’ve travelled, I’ve had a house, I’ve worked hard and got no where career wise. I’ve been in love and had my heart totally smashed to pieces. I’ve been a drug addict, a criminal, in rehab and in recovery. I can’t help but sometime feel like I’ve done a lot in my 35 years here and it wouldn’t be the worst thing if it ended here. I could stop having to go through every day just to go to bed only to get up again. Not loving it at all. 

If I could get a ticket out of here without anyone getting mad or upset, I would. 
I don’t know what the point of me living like this anymore  it has been hard having depression for 7 years now  I feel like I’ve achieved nothing in my life even though I have tried so hard to make things get better  
there is a point when being so lost and so alone isn’t possible to deal with anymore and I’m running out of strength to keep pretending that I’m all good like everyone thinks I am  
I hate this stupid illness & I wouldn’t wish it on anyone & I don’t think anyone can beat it because trust me I’ve tried

Hello everyone,
I really need some counseling and guidance on what I should do. Any help is appreciated. Also, English is not my first language so please do not mind if things do not make sense at times.
I came to Aus for my graduate studies. I have had issues since I was a teenager. My first years in Australia were also very tough and put an emotional stress on me. I have a habit of keeping things inside me. No matter what I go through, I prefer not to share it. And I guess issues kept piling up and I feel the burden weighing me down. It took me 5 years to finish my 3 years course. I barely passed subjects. I skipped 95% of the class. Sleeping became my safe space. When I am asleep, I do not have to think about the real world. I can pass time so much easily. I do not have to deal with issues. So, I kept sleeping. I would call in sick at work to sleep. I was working full time but on my days off, I would cancel plans to sleep. And no matter how much I slept, I still yearned for sleep, I was just so tired all the time. I gained so much weight and I was working so much and not eating at all. A few months later, I was diagnosed with Hypothyriodism which I thought explained all my issues with sleep and depression. So I did not seek any medical advice about my depression thinking that my medications for thyriodism would cure everything.
It has been a few years now and I am on medications for my thyroid issues and I do go for regular check ups but nowadays things have become unbearable. This whole week I called in sick at work and I slept until 2-3pm and did not eat until someone asked me to. I do not have thoughts of suicide and I really want to have a meaningful life but nothing interests me anymore.. nothing. I just wake up and watch tv all day to fill this void in my heart. I avoid talking to family/people, I avoid opportunities, Iavoid seeing people, I lie so often so that I can lay inside my room. And people may think I am lazy but laziness cannot be this severe. I do not know if I should see someone for this because I am an international student and have no medicare benefits and things might be expensive.
 I am thinking of quitting my job and do something that I am passionate about, but I really really need to address my issues. I thought I could control things like I always do but I don't think it will happen this time. I want to face my issues because I have stopped being the person that I am. 
Please help me on what you think I should do now.
Thank you.

Hi all,
Finally decided to post something after much apprehension. Oh well here we go I suppose. 
I am a university student who after an overall disappointing high school experience decided that university would be the point where everything would change for the better. I have spent the past year chasing perfection in my results in the hopes that I can transfer into my dream (and extremely competitive) degree next year. So that's worked out so far... at a cost.
I have struggled with forming friendships in the past but deluded myself into thinking that it would work out in university. Turns out I was wrong. I feel like I have nothing in common with those around me or that I do not understand small talk as if it is some wavelength that I am not attuned with. For the first few months of university I tried my best to make friends but I felt like I was just an 'extra' who accompanied them and this made me feel like I was an idiot. So hence I decided to give up, and from then on I decided that all I needed to make me happy was top grades. And so I spent the next semester working every single day, chasing every single mark. By the end of the semester I was exhausted and struggling to keep it up, but regardless I pulled through.
2018 rolls around and I've changed accommodation (hoped to find new people). By now the isolation is making my journey more difficult and sudden health problems ruin my midsemester holiday, bringing me down further. My mantra of perfection is now a facade to me but I still know I have to work. I experienced frequent moodswings and felt my attention and memory were falling. Despite all of this, I still keep my grades up.
And that brings us to now. I have one subject this semester (going for a year's worth as required for application). I feel physically weak and emotionally exhausted every day. I have to force myself to eat and some days I miss class and sleep until midday (I hate myself for doing this yet when I wake up in the morning the though does not cross my head). I despise the weather and my surroundings. I get no pleasure out of my hobbies as I can't focus. The worst feeling is the envy. I look at others my age around me and they appear to have friends and relationships. I feel like I am throwing my youth down the drain. My attention span is now abysmal. I study in tiny bursts at irregular intervals and hate how one last subject means so much. I've had enough of this year and everyone around me.

Have you guys ever had one of those days where you feel stupid? like you forgot how to do the simplest things that you usually do every day? I don't know what's happened but I've felt like an idiot for weeks now.
I'm a full time VCE student so my days are pretty stressful, but for weeks now I've just had trouble focusing in class. which is pretty scary considering I'm a massive nerd :)
I also work part time and I'm honestly scared to go now because of all the mistakes I've made. I think my boss thinks I'm a total idiot because at the end of the shift she gave me this long lecture about how my head shouldn't be up in the clouds and that working for her should be my number one priority. honestly guys I'm a peaceful person but that would've been a FU lecture if I had the opportunity.
Do you guys think you could help me out? maybe I'd feel better knowing I'm not the only one.

Hey guys,
I'm 23 and I'm new here. I first moved from NZ for Uni. Before then, i never had difficulties with social life or with myself. I was really enjoying Aus, i was making friends everywhere. But, I also experienced heartbreaks and fall outs with friends and that's when everything started going downhill . Although I've dated more guys since then, i felt like i was just a toy and till this day, i never felt like i was ever in a relationship, it definitely made me start to question myself. Over the past few years, my social circle shrunk but I was not bothered by it, as long as i still had my closest friends. It was when I started questioning the loyalty of my friends that made me depressed and lonely. For instance, I often feel like if i never spoke with my friends they'll never msg me. I've had my closest friends who just don't reply my messages. I admit i'm lousy at it as well, but not replying at all when i'm asking a question is plain rude to me. As a result, I feel overly sensitive which i hate. I became afraid to open up to people, worried that they'll think i'm being needy. i'm afraid to msg people because i'm afraid of rejection. I started cutting those who made me feel negative out of my life and realised i end up having very few friends. We are all full time workers now so it's hard for us to meet up especially when some of them have got partners. Being a full time worker, i think i'm losing more friends than i'm making so i feel ISOLATED. I'm seeking therapy but i have trouble opening up because i feel like what i'm going through isn't a big deal and there are people out there who are going through much worse so i should just get over my own troubles. I really want to regain my confidence and learn to love myself again but i'm struggling to do so and would really like to hear how some of you coped with this. :( 
sorry for such a long post

I don't feel like there is anything special about me to give.
I just don't know what to do anymore, nothing is working and I am driving people away with this even though there has been a recent surge of suicide rates in my area, and I take openly about my problems. sometimes I feel like even though I am not dead; im just another living dead casualty. Nobody cares unless your offering them something and they can only fain for so long before they just want me to get lost or find a replacement. Woman are the worst, whatever I conjure that makes me feel better they take away, steal it copy it from boyfriends put me down they copy everything from my style to jokes, even though they put them down. Everyone is always trying to change me while telling me how special awesome I am, its all LIES.
im so sick of the same kind of vultures in my life. I feel worthless, unsexy, replaceable. Nobody ever acknowledges me and some people completely forget me. I have a trail of bad exe's who will follow me to the grave trying to use me again, they're the only constant in my life.
The point is happiness and self worth are novelties, they never last. The heights I reach often determine the lows I will inevitably experience there after but I can't just stay in the middle it makes me exhausted and scared to bother trying anymore. The moment I feel slightly better someone comes along and takes it off me, I never get to be in the moment long. I have tried to feel better so many ways. Even the other week. got my hair done and it just looks horrible, my boyfriend didn't even notice but I kind of needed him to. Lately I feel like he wants me to be something im not criticising the way I dress and telling me I should sex myself up. its not me, I don't feel sexy at all.
I have looked at myself, listened to myself and the only reply I get in my head is confirming, im a nothing and my life is a waste. 
I have a relationship but it seems to be revolving around sex and again I am worried about being replaceable, im just a novelty to men and woman just abuse me for power. I just want to be at home, a child again not knowing any of this s. I just wish I didn't care like everyone else.

Hi, first time poster.  I run my own small business and have been told that I have a form of Bipolar called Cychlothymia (probably not spelt right).  Ultimately it means I have highs and lows.  The lows have become more frequent and last longer.  I have no energy and just want to sleep all the time, I can't remember things and have trouble conducting conversations.  When I do sleep, I have very vivid anxiety driven dreams and wake up feeling like I have had no rest.   A lot of mornings, the idea of getting out of bed and going to work makes me feel sick and makes my heart race.  When I am at work I have trouble making decisions, all of which increases my anxiety and spirals me deeper as I feel like I am not achieving anything. I am on medication but it doesn't seem to do anything, but I have an appt with a psychiatrist next week to review the medication.  I know that medication is not the only answer but I see a psychologist, which has been good but in my low lows I struggle to access the tools she has taught me.  If anyone has any suggestions, I welcome them, I also thought that just writing it all down might help.

Hi all, I am a 20 year old male who has been struggling with social anxiety and very low confidence which began sometime between the age of 15 and 16. I believe that my condition is also linked to the fact that I have matured at a slower rate, which has made me feel like I’m lagging behind what was expected at the particular time in educational and academic terms and socially, due to not displaying generic forms of behaviour matching the majority of people around me (not engaging in partying, drinking, smoking or visibly blending in to pop culture). The frustration of being caught in the clutches of this miserable condition is also not being able to pinpoint as to which extent is it due to my genetic makeup or social expectations that a person should behave in a certain way in order to be accepted. This condition has stopped me from progressing in to finding a direction as to which path I should follow career wise and has made me socially very isolated. The fact that the digital age has made it so readily available to observe the success and progress of others also doesn’t help. I find it very difficult to approach girls, as the fear of rejection and not knowing what to say or running out of things to say is stronger than need for human connection. I find myself always on the outside observing others having fun and having intimate relationships, which only amplifies and encourages my decline of confidence and sends me spiralling in to entrapment of this vicious circle.


Another huge contributor to the position I find myself in at this time is the fact that I did not have a constant male role model in my life. I was unfortunately a kid who essentially grew up with an absent father and as years progressed, the connection with my dad became more fragmented due to highly complex set of events. It is very difficult to talk about details on here but I would really appreciate if anybody here could suggest a psychologist they have personally benefited from or have known other people who have found help and resolution to their problems. I know there are many options available however I would be grateful for a point of reference from someone who has had good success in finding their way out of darkness. 


Thanks.

Around 18 months ago my husband & I separated.  He decided to leave the state with our children.  And at this point in time I wasn’t in any position mentally or financially to fight it.  It’s be tough being so far away from my kids so I made the tough decision to move closer to them.  I managed to secure a good job & friends offered for me to stay with them whilst I got set up.  A month ago the move happened & I’ve been struggling ever since & I’ve sunk in to a massive depression which resulted in me isolating myself today & not being able to go to work.   I’m struggling with my job & I feel like I’m not getting it - I spoke with my boss & he is happy with where I’m at so obviously it’s all in my head.  I haven’t been able to find decent affordable accommodation & my friends are sick of me staying with them so asked me to leave.  So now I’m staying in a caravan park whilst I try to find something permanent.  In the last 4 months the contact with my children has lessened & over the weekend my eldest treated me so poorly & I am feeling so hurt.  I don’t think they want me around in their life.  And I’ve found out my ex has a girlfriend & I’m so scared my kids won’t want me around any more.  That she will take my place as their mother or she will be a better mother than me.   I can’t dven talk to my kids st the moment - I’m so hurt & isolated. 
I feel ao overwhelmed & lost.  I don’t know what to do next.  I can’t afford to keep staying in the caravan park.  I can’t sleep.  I’m not hungry. I cry all the time. I feel like I’m letting everyone down.  I just want to go to sleep & never wake up.

I'm not sure where I should post this. It's a women's issue I guess. 
I am on antidepressants and have been for quite a long time. I have social anxiety which causes my depression and anxiety but I do feel that I have my dossage right at the moment. The problem is that I go through this same cycle every month. I track my period on an app and every month 1 week before my period is due I fall into a deep depression where I feel hopeless and sad and that I want to run away from my life. I have spoken to a gp about it but they haven't got any solutions for me. I have two small children and I hate myself that I can't pull myself out of it. I just want to sleep and I can't cope with everyday things that comee with being a mother and wife like fighting between the children and having to organise everyone. I cried so much today that my eyes  are so sore. I just feel so tired and wish I could leave and sleep for a week. I feel like my family would be better off without me sometimes.
Does anyone else feel like this each month? I feel like there must be something I can do. It can't be normal to constantly go through this cycle and even though I try not to let it show it definitely affects my family. My husband says my emotionals are like a roller coaster. I can be really happy but then each month I am having these extreme lows.

Hey, I'm sort of new to this. I've been suffering from depression since I was in school, and tried to ignore it. Unfortunately, both of my parents suffer different degrees of depression, as well as one of my brothers. Over the past 2 years, I've tried to get it under control, but as I started to seek help, I entered into my first relationship, and we use to get into fights, all the time. Him telling me to stop going from happy to upset all the time, and that I wasn't suffering depression; that it was all just stupid nonsense. He told me to go off my medication (which I only just started taking three months before we started dating). At the end of last year, after we broke up, I entered the worst state I have ever been in. It had gotten to the point of wanting to do some ""stupid"" things, and my family started to worry. A family friend, who has been through a lot in her younger years, finally dragged me back to the doctors to get back onto medication. It started to work, five months of feeling better than I have even been. But lately I started to sink again, entering those bad thoughts. I am kind of stuck at them moment, not knowing what to do. Some people tell me to get help, but I just feel like my problems are just a pebble in the ocean; that others have it worst. I can't talk to someone face to face, and I promised someone I would talk to someone... So here I am... trying something different, and hopefully finding a direction.
Thanks, I guess.

Ok long story short...
I have always been a loner at heart. I desperately want this to change. 
Since primary school I have always felt distant from others. 
Now in my mid-thirties I have a large group of friends; a handful of close friends; socialising is not a problem. I am not shy, happy to talk to anyone. I have an active and busy social life however my loner tendencies still haunt me. 
I moved to Australia a few years ago from Europe, started over. Most of my family has passed away. I am single. Childless. Desperately lonely. Prone to depression. I feel like on some level I must be pushing people away. Is my loner-ism psychological? Is it spiritual? It seems that on some level I cannot sustain relationships. I have seen counsellors and therapists. I’m honestly at the end of my tether. 
I’d appreciate any/all suggestions. 
Many thanks for your time.

I always just thought l was an emotional person which l didnt really see as much of a problem, l liked caring and having a heart. But now l feel its getting too much, if anything is a slight letdown or disappointment it affects me badly and l get so emotional and sometimes angry but I'm not angry I'm hurt, it just seems to come out as anger which is frustrating at times because l dont want to hurt the people around me. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was seeing a psychologist for a few months bit l stopped going when l felt she knew too much and l started to feel judged. I was also on medication for about a year bit stopped that not long ago because l became pregnant. 
I don't know what I'm asking for and know no one can help me only l can do that. I guess I'm just looking for someone to listen and to get the strength to do something about the way I'm feeling again. I just want to be content with life.

Hi all,

I'm new here. Have had anxiety all my life, but depression is new to me. I'm struggling to gauge how serious it is and how to cope. Doing all the right things - I'm on a waiting list for a psychologist, have a doctor's appointment for next week - but I just keep feeling worse and worse and I'm so lost right now with nobody I can talk to, because I'll either worry them or they won't understand. I think I just need to hear that it'll be okay? 

It started out this time as stress from a high pressure job. My mental health has deteriorated and now it all feels like a mess. I can't speak to my manager (who has previously been supportive) because my guilt and shame at not being able to cope is overwhelming. I've been in this job for a year and I feel like I deceived her at my interview by pretending I would be fine, only to fall apart. I can't quit because I can't imagine having to start a new job right now and I have a mortgage to pay. A day where I don't cry is a huge achievement right now. I've started having trouble sleeping which is rare for me, I'm more anxious, I'm back to hating myself. I feel hopeless and so mad at myself for not being able to cope with life like a ""normal"" person. Up until now I've still been able to do social things but that's getting too much for me now too. I've been limiting what I do for months because I'm very introverted and alone time has been important, but lately I've been lying to friends and saying I'm sick because it's just too hard to pretend I'm fine. 

I can't see any way of changing anything about my current situation, but I'm just so tired right now. Coping with life has never been more exhausting - and yet logically I know I'm lucky and it could be so much worse. I feel trapped and alone, and I guess I know it'll get better once I start getting help, but it doesn't feel that way. I just don't know what to do in the meantime.

Today I really struggled. My depression seems to have reached maximum and then some. As I write this I'm lying in bed. It's dark  and I can't even make out the walls or the door which suits me fine because the blackness just Echoes how I feel. Today I struggled all that I have in the past. I saw a documentary on television which was like watching my life in reality, its what I've been through as a child and it hurt. Was like somebody had read my inner core and put it out there for everyone to see. I just wanted to cry. Instead I went to my bed and laid there curled up sobbing silently knowing that there's nobody who really cares. I'm estranged from my son's. One daughter is in hospital very ill interstate and I cannot get to her finances don't allow it a failure on my part. My other daughter has two special needs children and is there fore me as the best she can be but I understand she needs to be there for her family first and foremost. My depression matches my room I'm lying in black and miserable. I tried some telephone counselling today as I cannot leave my house due to a fear of strangers after I had been assaulted about 18 months ago. I am struggling with basic supplies in the house and have no milk bread eggs butter fast running out of pantry Staples and too scared to go out and buy them and nobody in the area I live in to turn to to help me as I am just new here. I'm struggling to hold on and I know what it's like to go down that hell hole. I just don't want to be like this. I would like one day where I could have some semblance of normality. Some happiness. Something to look forward to. Not more of the same blackness embracing me. Surely there is more to life than this. I feel sometimes as if I'm just going through the motions and not actually living. I really don't know what to do. Being unable to leave the house means my social activities are limited. I try to read try to keep off the TV and internet and things that I know are unhelpful. I just don't know where to turn and I feel very alone. I see my doctor when I need to he's really good and I have a great relationship with him but he is now 45 minutes away and I am not changing doctors I cannot go through that hassle again and I have settled with him and he understands me. I do not know my neighbours having only been in this house 2 weeks. I am not aware of anybody who can help me and I just hate being this way. Surely there's more to life than this, at the end of the day this isn't living.

Hi everyone,
This may be quite a jumbled post. I have been a roller coaster of emotions for the last four days and I just need help. 
My boyfriend of over a year went to the GP on the weekend for help with his depression *trigger*... years ago he  tried taking his life and he used to self-harm. I knew he’d never received professional help but I thought he had been managing alright. He wouldn’t tell me why he was going for the appointment, and I only discovered the day after when I’d left his house that he’d been given a prescription for antidepressants and has been booked in for psychological help. 
That night, once I left his (we still live with our parents), I broke down in tears. I haven’t had a break down like that in months. Please don’t get me wrong, I am so, so glad that he’s realised he needs help and is taking action. But it broke me. I guess I value communication - he’s always so on to me to communicate, yet couldn’t or wouldn’t tell me how bad he is mentally again. He freely discusses it in Facebook groups with our friends (how I’ve found out all this) but struggles with me. I can understand he may be embarrassed, I feel he doesn’t want me to worry, but the silly boy doesn’t know it makes me physically sick when I am this worried about him. He always wants to be the strong one for me, and never lets me help him.
Onto me now.. two years ago my mum forced me into the GP to discuss my mental ‘issues’ that were causing me to ‘be lazy with schoolwork and have no motivation’. The doctor said after assessment I had moderate depression and referred me to a psychologist. Unfortunately she made things worse between me and my mum (who believed it was my fault I wasn’t listening to the psych and wasn’t better after a month) so I never went back. 
I just feel like I need some advice. Im much worse than I used to be. I ditch all of my worries about family, study, work and the future on him. I feel guilty and selfish for that. And I feel like I blame myself for him seeking professional help. He insists I don’t affect him in that way but I’d have to. And with him starting antidepressants, I am irrationally scared it’ll change him or make his depression worse. I don’t know why, but I can’t convince myself it’s okay. He wants me to get help as ‘I’m much worse than him’ (I have a lot of issues atm) but I’m scared. I’m 18 now, my parents can’t know. I don’t know if trying professional help again will be a better experience. But I need to help myself, to help him

Hi everyone, I’m a 25 year old with 2 children an d currently suffereing postnatal depression (being treated for) my parter is 26 and about 2 weeks ago told me he no longer thinks he loves me or wants to be with me anymore and was going to leave(he ended up staying) he went to see a doctor who said he had depression and put him on medication since taking them he has been emotionless, unhappy, grumpy and not wanting to do anything. He was also having dreams of violence and harming/killing me which then turned into dreams of him cheating on me with multiple women, he is saying he wants to get the ‘spark’ and in love feeling back in our relationship but we are unsure how to do this but he also changes his mind everyday on things he wants and is saying he doesn’t even know what he wants with anything. Has anyone else experienced that same thing? What was your outcome?

So woke up this morning greated with Ive had enough I want out we need to talk. Not really the way to get a good response from somebody with BPD. a 53 yr old male who 18mnths ago was lying in a bed in ICU because he tried to take his own life. Now Ihave done said hurt lied cheated and a whole lot more none of which Im proud of. Two things it would appear im crap at life and reltionships .I do take my meds and see my therapist and I try so hard but because you dont agree or do something another way your told its your illness over and over.really not the best thing to tell BPD sufferer .
Do I feel loved no abandoned yes  all of what I have done I own my mistakes yes sorry yes . I dont relly know if i feel safe depressed alone and scared 
I cant be intermit feel that ships sailed struggle with food and binge eating so not exactly slim taught and terriffic with low self esteem and the libido of a house brick dont  think medication helps with it either just want it to stop. At 50 ish its too hard no easier to deal with now than it was then.BPD sucks and most probaly one of the hardest to treat. Hard to hold it all in just keep living the lie.

Hello
I'm at a real low point now.Again.My life has never been easy&I'm described by old friends as the 'strongest' person they know.If they only knew.
Over last few years I've turned into a terrible person.I moved countries with my husband&kids,I've no family here (we're not close anyway),&my marriage broke down soon.It wasn't amicable,we both played our part & only recently are managing to get along with each other.Funnily enough he's the one I reach out to in my darkest hours as he's the only person who knows my personal torment.
3 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar 2.I accepted the diagnosis immediately&dutifully took my medication for 2 years.I felt no different whatsoever,only40kgs heavier&more zombie-like but in terms of my behaviours nothing changed.I was still the binge-drinking lush I'd turned into previously& more self-destructive than ever.
I weaned myself off the medication18mths ago while remaining on anti-depressants&somehow convinced myself I did not actually have bipolar, only bipolar 'tendencies'.I was just enlightened - how dare that psych label my personality as a mental illness just because I liked the odd shopping spree&was more spiritual than him!
This reasoning remained through losing 2jobs, all of my friendships, any potential relationships&the loss of respect of probably everyone I know.Today,after a brutal weekend of drinking which I'm too ashamed to go into,I've walked out of my job as I know I can't do it anymore.Ironically I had been assisting people with mental illnesses find their way back into the community...what a phoney.I know it wasn't good for my own mental health to be the 'strong supportive' person I'm expected to me - I'd rather have my health than money.
I'm posting because I've no idea what to do with myself anymore,so fed up of living this way.I'm aware I'm now in a downward spiral following hypermania and I'm just numb, nothing there.I desperately want to hold down a job like I'd always done but I don't know what I can actually offer anymore.
I need to change but where to start?I already see a psych&will visit my GP to talk meds.But I need to stop feeding my anxiety with alcohol.I completely understand why drug addicts get to that point, that's where I'm headed.Self-hatred doesn't even begin to describe how I feel about myself, not in a self-pitying way.I'm just disgusted with what I am.
Would love to hear from anyone who's come out the other end of this, or any help at all is much appreciated
Thankyou x

Hi all, I am new to this group. 
I am 52 years old and have suffered from social anxiety and depression since I was a teenager. I have been on medication for most of that time. I do not have a partner or children.
The last 6 years of my life have been crap. My sister has been diagnosed with cancer 4 times during that time, with the most recent diagnosis being a couple of days ago. She has been told it is terminal this time.
Also, my step father died from cancer 3 years ago.

And to top things off, I was made redundant 4 years ago and have been unable to find work since then, as nobody wants to employ someone of my age and with my health issues. I am not eligible for any government support as I am living off my redundancy pay.
I feel miserable most of the time and really have no idea how to feel better. Seeing a psychologist is not an option as I can't afford it and have not found them particularly helpful in the past.

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Hi, I am new to this here just signed up to read others posts and felt inspired?to post my situation.

Quick back story, now 32,
I was abused as a child (aged 4 to about 9/I 0 years old ) physically and verbally

*Chronic alcoholic from 13-30 (almost 2 years sober)

*diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and paranoia

*night terrors /panic attacks /hallucinations /feel like I'm dying /can't sleep & wake up constantly thinking I'll be murdered while I sleep 

*chronic migraines (generally everyday /at least every 2nd guaranteed) became chronic several months ago, upgraded from monthly or so. On zomig for that.

*Ticks- eye, shoulder and neck movements, have to keep remembering to untense face/expression

*tinnitus - really high pitch 24/7 can't think about it too much

I quit alcohol because I didn't want to lose my partner and our few years old son. (yes was very hard to do but I don't think about it anymore) but since being sober my depression keeps growing . I'm becoming manic, sometimes crying in the car park at work feeling sick in my stomach /butterflies. Empty but for the Overwhelming sense of dread, imminent danger. Stressing about people looking at me cripples me. Lost jobs over this. Some days I feel like I'm high on good vibes, feel powerful and resigned to life. Almost like in a state of nirvana, it's amazing actually. But those days are so rare it's mainly black. Some days the sadness is lesser but never gone.

I was on medication for about a year w/no affect so they put it up and everything went horrible so I stopped. Another medication, nothing, some other ssri can't remember made it all worse.
Anyone been through similar stuff like this and found their way through ? I'd love to hear about it. Thanks for reading

Hi there.
A little about me: I'm 20 years old and in my last year of my university degree which I now no longer know if I want to do. I am a residential staff member meaning I am an RA for a floor in the dorms on campus of roughly 20 people - their support network.
I have seen a few counsellors / psychologists in my time and have had depression since I was 12 years old - diagnosed officially at 15.
This year I have suffered so many depressive relapses and seen my uni counsellor every second week, however I still get panic attacks and constantly have the trembles of anxiety when I am alone in my room at night. My depression keeps me awake, keeps me from waking up when I do sleep, and forces me home from any non-compulsory classes.
I am also new to boys - my mental state was too shaky to engage in anything remotely intimate throughout the stages when you're supposed to so now I am left behind and am too nervous to do anything which caused me to lose the guy of my dreams recently.
I don't really enjoy any activities, I don't feel good enough for anyone to be friends with me, I do not feel worthy of my RA role, and I feel that I annoy everyone around me. It is getting very difficult, even with tools from the counsellors, to keep going and talking myself through every depressive phase that it is just that - a phase - and it will end. End.. just for another phase to come.
I am on medication and it works but i guess not enough to stop me from thinking about a way out yknow. However, I do not believe in suicide as such as it would do far too much harm to my family and I do not wish that pain on them as I have seen them through their parents dying etc.
It just sucks because I want to die but I can't and I don't really want to die but I already feel dead.
Suggestions?

Hi there. 
So I have gotten myself in a terrible situation. I have managed to get in debt $21 000 overseas. 
I met a guy here in London and I now live with him. Since I can’t work here I have managed to accumulate slot of debt. 
I am very depressed and know I should go back to Australia to get a job and pay it back but my boyfriend is here and I don’t want to leave him. But every day I am stressed about money. 
I used to look after myself ie buy nice clothes and get my nails done ect but I can’t do any of that anymore because I have no money. 
The thought of going back to Australia isn’t good as if have to move back in with my parents and get a crap job. And I’m 24 and I feel like I’m starting over again. 
 
Please someone help me. 
Ive never felt this low or hopless in my life.

I don’t know quite what to say or if anyone will listen. Finding the words to describe how I’m feeling is difficult. 
Maybe I’ll just share some quotes I’ve found to describe how I feel...
”have you ever been so sad it physically hurts inside.”
“I’m exhausted from trying to be stronger than I feel.”
“But, I mean who would be in love with me? That’s stupid.”
“How can I go forward when I don’t know which way I’m facing?”
“Stop thinking about everything so much, you’re breaking your own heart.”
“I can’t unlove you.”
“It hurts, it hurts a lot. But I’ll keep it to myself so it doesn’t hurt anyone else.”
“I disappoint myself.”
“Maybe I deserve all this.”
I’m so lost, my brain vs my heart. I know I should stay positive and it will get better but on days like this when you feel low and down you don’t know how it will. I read positive quotes and listen to advice and know it’s true but I still don’t fully believe it.
 I want to be happy, and it’s hard when you see others that seem to have everything you want but I know in real life everyone struggles. I hate feeling like this, so down, so lonely, so useless and not wanted. I stay in my room and hide because I don’t want my family to see, they are happy and if I made them worried or sad I would be worse because them being happy, makes me feel better, at least a little.
 I don’t really know why I’m on here writing this, I don’t know what I’m expecting to get out of this, maybe just to not keep it inside. I’m trying to be strong but today life’s just got the best of me. I feel stupid for feeling like this when there’s worse things happening to other people. 
Sorry if this made no sense or was negative, I’m not the type of person who expresses myself.

Hey everyone, im new to these forums. 
I have been diagnosed with bipolar now for 3 years. Although i have had drepression / manic problems now for coming up on 10 years. I cant seem to hold a job / study for more than 6 months at a time when i relapse. I do see a psychiatrist regularly and take my anti-psychotics, mood stabilisers and anti depressants every day (i feel like im eating a meal with the amount of pills im popping). 

At the moment im not working or studying but just trying to get better, but i find that when it comes to 1pm every day i can not stay awake. All of my medications have tiredness as a common side effect and i am considering going off of them because of this. Does anyone else have this problem? 
 
Thanks :D

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety over a decade ago. I tried medications, etc, and found over time learning to better understand my mental health has helped a lot and I've been doing markedly better. As with many people with depression, I found having animals helped me build a sense of purpose and self-worth. A reason to get out of bed; a reason to make sure I got home safe at the end of the day.

Long story short, two days ago, one of my pet ferrets, through total awful freak chances ended up breaking through the back of a cupboard, got into a cavity of our apartment complex and we have no way of getting her out. She is likely stuck somewhere which is why she hasn't returned. We have security cameras and know she went in there and didn't come back out.
We have tried everything recommended by the RSPCA, fire brigade, police rescue, etc. Even calling pest control to see if they could look in the walls for me, but they just dismissed me.

I've now got to come to terms with the fact that my beloved pet is likely dying in a hole within ten metres of me that I can not physically get to.
In the space of not even a day I feel like I've undone years of progress. I can't process the overwhelming feelings of grief and helplessness . There's nothing I can do. I just have to keep on existing while my pet dies. I'm mourning her, but she's still alive, and she's so close but I can't get to her.
What the hell am I supposed to do with myself while I'm helpless to the fact that the pet I love and care for like a child slowly dies, alone in the dark. I guess over time I've started to associate the wellbeing of my pets as a reflection of myself, and a sign that I'm doing something right, that I'm not useless.
This has been such a massive blow, in multiple regards, I can't even convey this in text. I've never had to deal with this sort of grief before, especially whilst in a severe depressive state. I don't know where to start processing this, I don't know how I'm going to move past what is happening right now. I can't switch off, I can't pretend this isn't happening. I can't distract myself.


How do I begin to process this mentally and emotionally? Can I?

After hospitalisation on 2016 I went nearly 18 months with a complete lifestyle change. Regular exercise, eating well & no drinking alcohol I lost nearly 30 kgs. I have lost my enthusiasm I had a short hospitalisation in February but I don't think it had the same life altering effect of my first hospitalisation. It's so hard to muster up my motivation for the gym I have gone from 3 times a week to barely 1. I am drinking regularly which promotes bad eating habits so the weight is creeping up. I hate my job I have a new boss who micro manages and I am constantly on edge I have done the wrong thing. I am going through family dramas with my mother with dementia & not all siblings agreeing with me as her guardian on how to manage her assets. I want to go back to late 2016 but don't know how to get back to that feel good motivated place :)

Hi everyone, back again with another issue in my life. Everyone here is always so helpful and have such great advice so I thought it would be a great place to air my thoughts. 
Work is my biggest problem and is causing me to have problems in my personal life. 
I have been at my job for 11 years and the past 9 months it has been so horrible. Last year things got on top of me and I ended up seeing a dr and getting on anti depressants. I also took my long service to help clear my head. I came back possitive but that was when things went bad. My boss said I wasn’t doing a good job and ended up taking over my position and putting me back where I started! I literally have a cardboard box for my things. I explained my anxiety and depression but it’s almost made things worse, he’s at me constantly. I’m in tears too often. I get great feedback from staff and customers, so I just don’t get it.
I have told him I will finish up at the end of the year but every day is like a week. I completely shut off outside of work because I feel so miserable. I don’t want to sleep because I have to go back the next day. 
If I change jobs, I know I will drop about $10 an hr in wages so I have to stay until September to pay my car. But then will need a job right away. If I stay until the end of the year I will have savings to take time off and find a job. 
Question is can I make it! I worry if the end is too far I might explode early but I’m scared to need a job right away. On top of the fact that I’m starting again which is scary in itself. 
Thoughts?

Hi, My name is Star and I am new to this whole forum/sharing about what I'm going through. I am feeling at a very low point in my life and I am having trouble finding any hope or passion about the future. This feeling is related to a depressive medical condition, and it is amplified by my external environment, living in Sydney in a house where I don't feel like I can fully flow to my own rhythm. I have trouble being around other people when I am like this. 
I feel lost, sad and unable to believe that the future will get any better. It is my hope that by sharing my experience with other people who are going through similar things, that I will feel a sense that I am not alone. Despite working in a creative field, true expression is something that I struggle with - when other people are involved. I have a lot of difficultly authentically expressing myself when I feel ""negative."" My outlet for this so far has been through writing in a journal, but this is not shared with anyone. I'm hoping that by sharing my feelings and experiences with others, this will help me heal.

I’m stuck between wanting to live my best life and to be happy/ positive and keep up with my fitness but I keep getting dragged back down with my own mind. Recently I’ve had no time to focus on my mental or physical health due to the amount of school work I had (year 12) and I knew before that I was spiralling down again into depression and anxiety had peaked back up only I wasn’t dealing with it how I should. At first I kept my mind distracted by talking/ hanging out with a guy and then avoided thinking about due to school work. Problem is I need to deal with it and I don’t know how to help myself, I’ve tried seeing someone at school but they are useless, I tried getting an appointed with someone from headspace but they are too full and never got back to me. Someone please give me advice.

I’m just frustrated and feeling
hopeless about my future…
I've been suffering from
depression and social anxiety for about 7 years now and haven't done anything
about it because I’m too much of a coward to go seek help.
I was living with my girlfriend
of 8 years and we mutually decided to end things because she has hopes of
getting married and starting a family and she obviously has a time limit. And
at this point in my life, in this head space I'm just not ready to commit. 
She’s already seeing other people. We still talk often
and I’ve visited her a few times. I honestly wish her the best in life and she
deserves all the happiness in the world, she’s really an amazing person. I can’t
stop crying while I’m writing this, but it’s just difficult for me to see
someone that I love, someone that I shared 8 years of my 20’s with - dating
other people.
I moved out and now I live with
my parents. I’m extremely grateful and lucky that I have parents who were
willing to take me in and provide a roof over my head and food on my plate
otherwise I’d be living on the streets. I've been living here for 3 months now,
and I can’t stop thinking that I’m just sitting here wasting time. My parents
are getting older and I can’t be relying on them to be taking care of me.
Thinking about this leaves me sad, frustrated and feeling hopeless.
I struggle to go to sleep and
wake up in the mornings, if it weren't for that fact that I have to drive my
parents to work in the mornings I honestly wouldn't wake up at all.
My entire day is basically
spent on the computer, playing games, watching videos and streams and whatever
else I can find to keep my mind occupied and distracted from the fact that I am
an absolute loser. 
From the second I wake up I
take 4 steps to my computer and sit my ass down for the entire day only getting
up to go eat and go to the toilet and have a smoke.
When I get into bed I often cry
myself to sleep. This isn’t what I had imagined my life to be like. I had huge
ambitions… I had a vision of who I would be in my 30’s and my reality is the
COMPLETE opposite.
I want to change my life but I
don’t know where to start or what to do.
I feel hopeless and scared that
I’ll never be able to live a happy and productive life.

No one seems to care, Ive tried everything to get better ,wrote all my thoughts down in a journal or exercise till I threw up, no matter how much I did it was always short term and it made no difference to the nights, I told my parents everything as a final cry for help, that was 3 weeks ago, they just said i had to exercise more often then already my 5 times a week, and they will maybe look for someone that I can talk to, and basically what I got out of that was its my fault that I can't manage myself because I don't do constructive things. I cant put any weight on anyone anymore without them wanting to keep distance afterwards, I used to have so many friends, and a while ago for the first time in my life Ive had to make excuses to why I don't hang out with my friends, I cringe every time I think about that because I don't have any friends, I hate myself. I don't see myself being around to graduate school, not at this rate.

Hi People,
I’m new here, bit nervous, wonder if anyone has some wisdom for me. I am working full time in a management position in a specialist health field that can be highly emotive and divisive. I have spent >20 years in this field supporting the clients and yet still had work life balance with my partner, children and family. I made the decision to take the fulltime management job as my children are almost grown and I felt I had a lot to offer the position. At first it was going well however the last 6 months things have not been going well, I feel disillusioned with my workplace, feel I do everything wrong, worthless, anxious at work, brain working very slowly, not motivated, avoid certain difficult people as my heart races if I see them, coming home crying in the car most nights, no energy, no pleasure to go out and do anything outside work. When I started 18 months ago I felt none of this was excited to be doing it.
I don’t want to just leave for the following reasons:
my bosses tell me I’m doing a good job and I feel I would be letting them down 
 Don’t know where else to go options are limited
feel I would be running away and should face my problems at work and deal with it
I don’t know how much longer I can go on though. If I left and went elsewhere would it be the same now? Don’t know what to do does anyone have any experience to share?

Hi everyone
does anyone have advice for me - my therapist is on holiday, I can’t get in to see my GP until next week and I’m struggling.
every day I’m crying, I can’t sleep, I’m managing to go to work but I feel like im on the edge of being able to function.
what do you do when you can’t access your health professionals? Has anyone had a positive experience with any phone help lines ?

Do you ever get lonely even when there are people around you?
Do you feel as if you want to be alone, but know that it will make your depression build up?
How do you deal with it?
I find that lately I want to cry, for no particular reason, I feel low, I feel as if no one cares, the black dog circles waiting for his moment to jump and hold me down.
I am asked by my daughter if everything is alright, and I say oh yes, I'm just a bit tired. I dont know how to explain it to her, and that makes me feel bad. My two grandsons aged 5 and 10 make me smile, but it's hard, and I try to be """"""normal"""""" for them.
I try hard for everyone. I have forgotten how to care for myself, and i really cant be bothered if the truth be known.
I have no friends, so dont do coffee mornings or have someone to chat with and pass the time of day. The ones I had didnt understand my mental illness and slowly pulled away.
I find my being alone, which I once enjoyed, I am started to loathe, but I dont want people. I am in a catch 22, like the mouse in a wheel.
I feel like I am standing on the edge of a giant black abyss, perpetually looking down, wanting to step off, but not wanting to at the same time, something and I dont know what is holding me back.
My depression runs my every waking moment, and my nights too, not allowing me to sleep, creating chaos in my head, questions - no answers, sadness, upset, anxiety, panic, negativity, no matter how tired I am, it keeps me awake.
I dont want to give in to it, but I cant feel myself sliding along towards it, and it's getting quicker and quicker and I am have troubling stopping myself for long enough to turn around and get away.
so what do I do? I have no idea.
I just want to put it down in writing, hoping it might help me, and maybe, just maybe, somebody out there understands.

Hi all,
Im a 24 year old from Sydney. I work full time, have a loving partner and am known for having a bubbly friendly personality. What most people don’t see is that when I’m alone I become a different person at times - I become very sad, quiet, insecure and cry a lot. 
Ive always had this problem but it became worse when I had an autoimmune attack at 23 and was told I would likely develop MS in the next few years. At this point I experienced my first feelings of hopelessness and depression as I believed I wouldn’t be able to work anymore and support myself. 
Although I’ve now recovered from the attack, I can’t shake off this feeling of hopelessness. I feel mostly negative about all situations in life and experience very large mood swings throughout each day. I’ll feel positive when I have to put a front on at work and then as soon as I’m alone on my lunch break I get those feelings of emptiness and loneliness. I get terrible negative thoughts about myself, how terrible I am and how I’ll never amount to anything in life with MS holding me back.
I get anxious in social settings and although I feel lonely I always avoid socialising as I tell myself that no one wants to be around me.
I can’t explain my feelings properly to anyone because my moods change so rapidly and I almost forget the details of how I feel or what I think when I’m in this bad state. So every time I go to talk to a counseller, I feel like I’m not getting much out of it because I’m not able to explain exactly what I’m feeling. I also have trouble expressing myself which makes me downplay my emotions when I talk about them.
i don’t know what to do because I’m stuck in this predicament where I feel so low at certain times and feel like there’s no one or nothing that can help me. When I feel okay I just avoid bringing it up all together so I don’t bring back those emotions. People in my family and friendship group always call me dramatic all the time so I feel like I’m burdening them by talking about how I feel or they simply will think I’m exaggerating. I feel embarrassed speaking to anyone I know about this which is why I’ve come here. 
does anyone have any advice on what I should do?? Right now I’m very down and I feel very hopeless about everything in my life. I’m tired of hating myself and my thoughts are so painful to deal with sometimes as I’m constantly putting myself down and beating myself up. I just don’t know where to even begin. This is my best attempt at explaining my emotions.

Hello reader,
I don't really know how to open this so I'll just jump in. I've been on the depression train for nearly 10 years now. I'm Male, I've gathered some pretty good knowledge on identifying my triggers and explaining what's going on with me to others. But theres one thing I just can't tackle and that's my ever waining libido.
I know I want to have sex, i think about it, but much like everything else, there is almost the adverse of motivation. It's probably too late to say its starting to effect my relationship, I've tried swapping medications, I'm on one currently that apparently doesn't interfere with your libido. I take care of myself regularly in that way, but it always seems habitual and almost like a chore.
I'm fresh out of ideas, we've tried spicing things up, spontaneity, and even planning a time. It doesn't work. When it does I'm often too quick out of the gate or pushing rope. I'm not in any kind of distressed headspace. I love my partner, I'm as attracted to her as ever, but I'm just never in the mood.
Those few times I am I feel embarrassed, and even start to defeat myself. I was a marathon man not 5 years ago, I'd stop for breaks and go for hours. It was a huge part of who I was, and it's just disappeared.
what can I do?
Did I burn it out with my brief years of heavy debauchery?
Is it as some of my friends say, just a part of a long term relationship (going on 4 years)
I rarely drink, I don't use drugs, I'm active in my work, I'm not unfit. What is it?

I get overwhelmed occasionally and fear that I’m never going to get over my current bout of depression which has been going on for almost a year. It just seems daunting. I see a professional, I take my medicine (recently changed) and I try. But I feel like I’m a failure. I’m still not back at work and there are days where I can’t get out of bed. I’m scared I won’t get better ever. 
 
Does anyone else feel this way?

For most of this year I have been sleeping alot during the day because of illness and other things as well. I live on my own in a rental unit. However since the beginning of last year I have slowly lost interest in the things I used to like and I have cried a lot and felt sick. I also dont want to do anything not even food shopping.  I am on anti depressants but they may not be working. I am also unable to concentrate. Can anyone give me advice.

 I’m new to this so I don’t really know how to start or where to start. I’m just really depressed, I feel nothing, if I try to talk to anyone about how I’m feeling (parents, family, friends) no one takes me seriously, they have a certain perception of me, they just look at me as the “young(21), healthy, relaxed beach loving, surfy”. So they think there can’t be anything wrong, but there’s more to me than all that, I may be a young dude, but I’m a human being after all. I just need someone to listen to me and not just brush aside the way I’m feeling because I’m young and what not. I tried to end it all, end my life. It didn work. Honestly all I want to do is to end it all, end all the anxiety, panic attacks, negative emotions, the stress, the anger, the depression. I honestly can’t deal with life anymore, I just want out, I want to end my life. I don’t even know why I’m on here, I feel like an idiot for writing all that. I just, I need help, I geuss, I dunno.

Hi, I am feeling so lost and like a failure in my work life. In the last two years, I have had 5 different jobs all in different fields. Out of 5 jobs, I was made redundant from 3 and the other 2 didn’t work out either.
The latest job I had was working in a florist, which is my true passion and what I would like to do. Last Friday morning I came into work and was told that they didn’t have enough hours for me anymore and the boss had to let me go. I had only been working there for 2 months.
I am very confused because my boss only hired a new girl about 2 weeks ago, and also hired someone else about a month ago. I don’t understand why I have been let go again when the boss is bringing on new people.
I feel like a loser and a failure in my life. I always try to do my best at work and I feel that I have not succeeded in a career and I am falling behind my friends who are all happy in their jobs. 
Over the weekend I have felt very depressed and suffered low self esteem, I layed in bed all day on Saturday and Sunday crying in my room because I feel there is something wrong with me.
is there anyone who can relate? Looking for some understanding or advice

From a few google and youtube searches I think I have symptoms of HFD including low self esteem,  difficulty making decisions ( I procrastinate a lot) and feeling hopeless. I have also completed the test in beyond blue and it came up with the possibility of moderate depression. I am 32 y/o female, cant find anything I am interested in e.g hobbies, don't appear to be attractive to Men (only ever had 2 men show an interest in me and then I pushed them away after 1-2 dates) and find it hard to
make friends incl approaching people or starting a conversation (on the
other hand when I am involved in a conversation have been known to
monopolies it or appear to be a know it all). I have had these symptoms for as long as I can remember. Could I be depressed or am I just a boring and lazy person?

Hi, so I've not long been looking into depression after thinking I might have it somewhat. I just googled, 'can you have depression for no reason' and it turns out you can. I didn't want to actually phone someone to seek help because I feel like I don't have problems compared to others. Honestly I don't know what my problem is but I feel like everything is just starting to take its toll on me. My son is nearing 2.5 and I haven't really had a break since he was born - not a single night apart. My partner works FIFO so he's barely home and I'm on my own more often than not. I work four days a week but lately barely even want to get out of bed let alone go to work. I felt like I hit an all time low the other week, several times I'd had the thought of dying and it didn't bother me in the slightest. I don't really hang around any friends often and usually I'm okay with being on my own but I've felt flat out alone as of late. When I get into these moods I think if things I wouldn't normally - like how much I miss the big family gatherings we used to have as a kid (they stopped because families broke up) or I want to see my nanna who passed away some time ago. I just want to know what I can do to help myself please? I don't want it to worsen to point of medication, if it is depression.

I'll start off by saying I never expected to be here. I have always been an incredibly optmistic positive person. However in the past eighteen months this has not been in the case. I have become withdrawn, fatigued and regularly pull away from those around me. I confided in my best friend earlier in the year. Initially she was very supportive. We had regular coffees and discussions as to how she could help. We also work together, which when surrounded by a large group is when I feel at my worst. In recent weeks I believe this has weighed upon her heavily, she has blamed herself for her negativity when we talk and now we talk very little only discussing the most mundane of topics at limited times. She has now become very frustrated when I withdraw or don't greet her with the enthusiasm I once did. This has resulted in me being described as a bit of a shit bloke because of it.She is a quite blunt indivdual and tells it as it is which normally i do appreciate but not so much in recent times. I have few friends I truly would hang onto if I could, but at the same time I do understand her difficulties based on how I have been recently compared to what would be considered my normal personality. I try to be an open individual and have made attempts to air our grievances (as I have now become frustrated with her frustration) but these offers have been rejected. I have almost become anxious over this relationship and no longer know how to approach this situation or even if I should to keep the friendship together. Has anyone had any experience with this and if so what was the result?

I feel so lonely. I have nobody here in Australia anymore.
All my “Friends” are my boyfriend’s friends. This weekend it really made me
realise how alone I am. Myself and my boyfriend are constantly arguing at the
moment because I feel like he is being distant. Its just not the same at the
moment between us. I feel like I am always walking on egg shells and the past 7
days I have cried myself to sleep most nights. I hate it when he shouts but
then he says its my fault and never takes responsibility for his actions. He
makes me believe I am mental which I think he is right and I am. I hate to cry
in front of him because he just calls me a drama queen and doesn’t comfort me.
It hurts even more that I am so anxious and exhausted for all the negativity and
when I cry next to him in bed he just ignores me, how can you see the person
that you ‘love’ struggle so much. It is absolutely draining me. I have nobody
to turn to or talk to about anything in my life and I can’t just get away to
see a friend because I don’t have any. 
I have suffered with severe depression before I moved to Australia
2 years ago and even though I am not as bad as I was I suffer daily still with anxiety
and bad thoughts. This weekend I have been in a very dark place, the worst
since I have been over here. I don’t want to watch tv, sleep, eat, speak or do
anything and just find myself staring at the wall or floor for hours. I just don’t
really know what to do, does anyone have any advice? I think I should have some
counselling but its so expensive here I think and because I am not a permanent
resident I don’t think I can get it. 
 
Any support is appreciated

Hi
I am new to this forum. Over the last few weeks I have taken time off work as I have fallen into a depression. Sadly a job in a sector I enjoy, however due to contracts in the public sector my contract ends in a few weeks time. Although I have enjoyed the work office politics always seems to appear and my acting manager for some reason has caused me a bit of extra stress which I feel was unnecessary however it got the better of me and did contribute to some time off.
Struggling with what appear to be depression. A lack of support doesn't help however I always try to push through. It feels like it has finally got the better off me and everything is out of control. 
I feel like such a mess, unsure of how to get out of this hole I keep sinking back into. 
Money is not everything but mortgages and the cost of living is causing me so much stress as I can't afford to stop working. At what price though does the cost of my health and wellbeing continually win over money? I have always worked unless I have taken leave or mental health days. 
I have never felt so unhappy and are at a crossroads now as to just finish up now knowing it ends in three weeks anyway. I don't think I could get any more down and going there increases my anxiety levels. I have recently cut out benzo use which I realised with the help of a good psych were just a mask to help me cope or ignore the real issues.
Does any of this resonate with anyone here?

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety several years ago (six maybe?). I had trouble maintaining employment. Its now been twelve years since i've been able to stay employed for more than a month. It has been six years since i was last employed at all. I have been through 4 therapists and 5 or 6 medications and i'm worse than when i started. I've lost the ability to care about anything. I have been unable to maintain my treatments for any other conditions. I cant meet centrelink requirements and cant be bothered even trying to do so. My only motivation to get better is so that i'm not a burden on my parents any longer and even that barely registers as an issue. It took me a year to get enough motivation to make a doctors appointment. But i now have one in two weeks time. What should i do at that appointment? Get another therapist to tell me about CBT and mindfulness even though it doesnt help me? Get another prescription that zonks me out and doesn't help with my motivation? I only made the appointment because its all i can think to do, but no treatment has had any effect so far. Is there something else i should be asking for?

Hi life hasn’t been the best for the last few months. Seems like one little bad thing apon another have been compiling together. It’s all feeling to much now and I need vent it out before I fall of into the abyss. I don’t really have anybody I can’t talk openly at home as we have very different coping methods to what’s happening.
- First of I found out my niece and nephews are moving two states away in October. I’ve been like a father to them since they where born 7 years ago. I don’t believe I will be seeing them much anymore and it’s killing me.
- Second my one and only close friend I have hasn’t wanted to catch up a lot lately. Not to sure what has happened?
- Third work has been super stressful, more than normal and money has been tight.
- Forth one of my childhood friends is getting married in the next few weeks. We drifted apart but never had bad blood. He didn’t invite me to it even though I invited him to mine and he came. Was a bit of a kick in the guts as everyone else from our old friend group did.
- My migraines have escalated because of stress and smoke from cane fires. I was in a chemist getting my script filled when I was ridiculed by the pharmacist in front of all the other shoppers. Saying all my migraines are my fault and lucky he’d give it to me. (BTW it isn’t painkillers) My doctor is happy with it and the pharmacist made me so feel so bad.
Even before pressing the post button I feel better getting this off my chest. I’m on antidepressants which helps some, therapy doesn’t help me. Writing on here seems to help a little bit for me. My wife doesn’t like talking about these things. Her vault puts Fort Knox to shame but she is my one and only reson for living at the moment.
Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Hi, im wanting some advise. My partner is going through a tough time, and in the last couple of weeks Ive seen him take a massive downturn in his mental health. He had gone through depression a couple of years ago and nearly took his own life. Ive been seeing
some signs for awhile and this last week has had me very concerned.
I also have anxiety so feeling the affects of this quite deeply.
All of a sudden hes become easily aggitated and angry, given me the silent treatment and not telling me what Ive done wrong. We have been arguing a bit over his problems with communicating effectively. Hes neglecting all his responsibilities and is
totally consumed with his fathers failing health, and is shutting out all other areas of his life. Unfortunately this is causing me more stress as Im now left with all financial responsibilities along with currently having to find a new place to live.
He is in NZ at the moment with his parents so the distance is also adding pressure.
As I have been so distressed this week in not being able to reach him, I emailed his mother expressing my concerns. They had seen him through his last bout of depression and felt they would know what to do. I didnt feel like I had any other option and needed
to reach out to them for help. Unfortunately its angered him more and hes ended the relationship. Im doing what i can to cope but wondering if I did the right thing? I couldnt just not do something, and i know he wasnt asking for help. I dont believe
in walking away from some one you love. I dont know what Im asking for...maybe some advise on how to handle this. Ive also not heard from his mother and I honestly thought we got on well with each other. Any advise you gave for me would at the very least help
me make sense if all this. Thank you.

So lately I’ve not been feeling okay. And I get that’s normal for depression blah blah. But it’s different. I’m in bed all the time, last night I was on the floor for an hour breaking down. I’m having major issues and it’s normal for a teen to go through issues yes? But my depression is worse than it’s ever been. It’s getting in the way of everything. Work, study, my routine. I’m gaining weight like crazy, and this isn’t good for me. My medication I’m on have a side effect of weight gain. I was getting so good with my weight and now I’m huge again. 
I’m falling apart slowly. And I just can’t take it. people always say “it’s okay not to be okay” and this means so much to me. Yeah I’ve got a lot going on, but this simple sentence has put a lot of light in my dark mind lately. 
Stay safe friends 💖

Hi all....I'm struggling with recurrent depressive episodes...i hv schizoaff and am fortunate my relapses are related more to mood than a psychotic relapse...I just find the recurring depression tiring, frustrating...it hinders my progress in career and studies...I have always had self doubt but when I'm well, it doesn't affect me so much...But in my down periods it's almost as if it won't leave me alone and what I've learnt from CBT and ACT and meditation, yoga goes out the window and I'm consumed. I've been surviving/struggling/managing for about 15 years and recently started a mood stabiliser...I just wonder whether this cycle will ever stop or whether it's something that will always occur despite the meds (which have helped) and the psychology  (which definitely are useful). I'm in the middle of a down period now and up titrating my mood stabiliser...Just wondering if this cycle of depression will ever go away or whether the more realistic expectation is that it'll probably come back, but will not be as bad ir frequent...thanks!

I've never been on these forums before, so I'll introduce myself, I'm 34 and about to have my 35 birthday. My mum has terminal lung cancer and will be dead in a matter of months according to doctors. I suffer sever sleep aponea, ADD,  chronic depression and anxiety. Years ago, back before they shook up the DSP rules, I was doing consecutive WFD programs one after  another. This was after leaving a job I was good at becasue my family was moving state. Over the course of these programs I became very depressed because of the futile activities people are requried to do. Eventually I broke, and got put on DSP. From then on I was put on and rejected from almost every job network because of the 'funding' related requirements, and not being helped with actually getting work or work experience. I could search for jobs on my own, but was usually rejected after a time for lack of experience. I've got two Cert IVs in IT, the newest which is 4 years old, yet I am so desperate for work that I apply for anything despite my level of education. Nothing helps, I've been trying 7 years and nothing helps. I was put on medication some time ago which allows me to function at 80% of any other employee, but now centrelink has reduced my capacity to work and I can't tell them I'm able to because a) the medication isn't PBS covered, and I'm allergic to what is b) if I lost DSP I would lose the medication and be unable to cope up too and if I got a job because it's what gives me the ability to function at 80%. In a few months I will only have my sister, other than that I will be completely alone, my other closest friend online also has cancer and she will be gone soon too. I know this sounds trivial, but at my age there is no real assistance, no help, I've been put on the scrap heap of society and if I only had a chance I feel I could get off it. It feels like life is becoming completely meaningless, and I'm about to be hit with a tidle wave of loss, and I just wish it would stop/slow down so there was more time to fix things. So..... Anyway....... that's me... Anyone else on DSP that really wants to join the real world but has been sidelined with no assistance?

I feel like I've missed the boat. Everyone I grew up with has their shit together and I'm still living at home trying to find entry level jobs to apply for. I've worked as a security guard, a bush regenerator, a door to door sales person, a housekeeping attendant, and have also completed a handful of useless short courses. Nothing, and I mean literally nothing has ever drawn me in, sparked my interest, ignited a flame, in regards to wanting to pursue it. I absolutely dreaded every moment of the jobs I listed above and quit after 3-4 months each. As a result I have had varying periods of stability throughout my life so far and it causes so much god damn uncertainty and anxiety it ain't funny. I am a highly orderly and self reliant person and my current life position is making me very low, lower than I have ever felt before. Living at home with my parents, no income or savings, no close friends, dwindling happiness, no direction, just.. nothing going on in the mind. People ask me what I am interested in or what I want to do, and I honestly say I don't know and am given strange looks as though I am lying or looking for pity. But the truth is I.. just don't know. I never feel like I fit in anywhere I work and often feel that people perceive me as angry/tired/arrogant due to my basic nature of being very reserved and content. I open up around some people and especially when I am alone I enjoy singing along to music or playing my instruments while having a few quiet drinks. But everywhere I have been this far in life seems to reject that sort of approach. It's all extroverted and in your face. My parents are afraid for me lately as I am of myself too. Not in a serious ""wanting to check out"" sense, just that this all feels like shit just got very real very quick. I recently quit another job after 5 weeks. I was working aged care but genuinely felt it wasn't suited to me into the future so decided to pull the plug. Very confronting and challenging work, requiring a dedicated people person, which I can't offer at the moment. I've lost some other points I had on my mind sorry everyone. If anyone out there in this large community has any advice to offer me please don't hold back, I need all and any of it I can get. Thanks.

Hi all, this is my first time posting, i am a very private person and mostly try to cover my depression, I'm a little unsure how this forum is going to work for me, I'm hoping it can be a place i can be honest and open. I have struggled with depression for about 40 years, since adolescence, managing to be functional most of the time by hiding what i was feeling. disability and  serious health problems overthe last 2 years hasmade my depression and anxiety so much worse to the point of not being able to function and having several hospital visits. A couple of months ago i suffered a cardiac arrest and resuscitation  while in recovery from a thyroidectomy,  since then my depression has worsened greatly and i am returning to hospital soon. Does anybody else have experience with a connection between depression and cardiac arrest? I don't actually remember the event but i needed cpr and reintubation, i ended up in icu for 2 days and had a boken rib and sternum, recovered now. Many people seem to report having a new lease of life after an event like that but i feel the exact opposite. I am being treated by a psychiatrist and a psychologist,  but feel mostly that doctors have given up on me as i am not responding to treatment.  Thanks in advance for any comments.

Hi everyone,
I’ve just joined and hoping someone has some insights. I’ve got chronic depression (not sure if anything else), diagnosed about 15 yrs ago but I reckon I’ve probably had for much longer. 
I saw psychiatrist/s and psychologist/s for a long time but not really at the moment and I don’t share a lot of my thoughts and feelings with my partner, family or friends.
I sort of feel like because I more or less cycle in and out of varying levels of sadness, that I don’t want people to know about it and worry or know that they can’t do anything.
The trouble is I end up bottling things up I suppose.
Does anyone else feel like this? How do you balance sharing information with people and being authentic, with the other side?
Do you think I just need to always have a counsellor, etc., a third party who isn’t personally invested?
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
S.

There was once a time in my life where I was completely terrified of talking and socialising with others, particularly girls - however in my first year of university I managed to come out of my shell and made what I thought to be friends, some of which happened to be female. It seems as I have developed the confidence to socialise people have begun to ignore me. During that same year I had a falling out with my main friends group and was left with only few friends who I had met at uni. Fast forward to this year and although on the surface level I have made friends, I have never felt more alone in my life, not only am I depressed but I feel extremely bitter almost misanthropic at times. The person who I consider my closest friend needs convincing to even sit next to me during lectures, she claims that IRL communication is not important for her which I accepted giving the benefit of the doubt. However today when she did decide to sit next to me, she essentially ignored me talking to another guy instead (no she is not interested in him, she is a lesbian). I'm 100% fine with her having other friends, but from her body language and tone she almost dislikes talking to me, I don't want to confront her about it but sometimes I feel like she is only pretending to be my friend. My other friends rarely make an effort to talk to me unless I'm offering them help with university work in which they are all to eager to talk to me until their issue is resolved. I hate sounding so nihilistic and cynical, I feel like I am treated differently than everyone else, I am not incredibly charismatic nor humorous, it's like all I'm wanted for is my ability to help others. I do enjoy helping others but no one ever seems to even do the courtesy of asking how I am... When I am one-on-one with people I seem to be able to get some friendliness, but as soon as there is another person in the equation it is like I don't exist. People I consider friends sometimes ignore me when I'm walking past, pretending to not see me - or take 2 weeks to respond to messages saying that they 'hadn't seen them'. My parents always say that you'll make friends and find a girlfriend because you're still so young but it just feels like my youth is wasting away as everyone else is having fun. Sometimes I have wondered whether I have narcissism for wanting to be at the centre of attention all the time, but is it too much to ask for others to acknowledge you for once?

I'm not sure where to post this topic on this forum, I tried posting something similar on whirpool but the comments were vastly unhelpful, and some were just outright judgmental. 
I have been on newstart for almost 3 months, and I'm just wondering what happens shortly after this period? I am scheduled to see the job search provider sometime in July for the second time. I don't plan on staying on newstart forever, but the extra money is definitely helping me out in my current situation. Due to a lot of trauma, involving sexual assault and a very recent disconnection with toxic family, I have been unable to work. I've been consistently depressed and anxious, and honestly, seeing a counselor recently, made me feel even more terrible about mental health professionals. Although I am considered to be stream A (have a degree, have had work experience, etc), I still suffer with trauma and chronic physical pain/fatigue on a daily basis. 
I suppose I'm just wondering how long I will be able to stay on newstart, before the job agency makes me attends interviews and jobs I don't really feel ready for. Ideally, I would like to stay on newstart as much as I could, whilst being able to work on healing, without other job obligations impeding that. 
At this point, the financial strain weighs heavily on my mind and I feel that I ought to work, but I feel mentally and physically incapable sometimes.

Hi everyone
new to the forums, first post.
i have depression, anxiety, bpd, social phobia.
im having trouble making big decisions. Does anyone else have this too? I don’t trust my own opinions or decision making process, I think because I can’t tel if it’s really me or the illness talking. for e.g. I’m working a contract job,?the job has been advertised and I can’t decide if I should apply for it or not. 
Just when I think I’m doing well something sets me off. I got given the wrong coffee order yesterday and it made me cry. Like everything is so messed up I can’t even get a coffee right.

Long story short - depression and anxiety on and off since I was 10. 28 now, been with my current employer for almost 8 years. Managed myself for most of that, structure has changed with a lot more middle management in place now, which has added a lot of stress and changes to my routines. Used to be a daily drinker, quit mid last year and been struggling a lot more ever since. Placed on SSRI by psychiatrist late last year, success with massive reduction of anxiety. Quite a lot of time over the last year taken off of work due to mental health. 
Brings me to now: stopped social outings almost completely, ordering food in, not taking care of hygiene, playing more video games because it occupies my mind. Previously when I've hit these depressive slumps I start getting anxious which alerts me to what is going on. SSRI = no anxiety so I've somehow reached the most depressed point I've ever been without even realising. In my mind this is how I wanted to spend my time. Depression is 10x worse in the mornings, I literally got excited the other week when I woke up with a cold so I wouldn't have to go in to work. Battle to get out of bed, when I do I rarely get to work on time. Impulsive spending is out of control.
It's gotten to the point I'm scared to even tell work I'm not able to come in, my boss has stopped asking how I am. He seemed understanding early on but I guess he's reached his limit on tolerance. I'm a hard worker every second I am at work which is recognised. I have messaged my old sort-of boss I can trust who's higher up for her advice. Previously I could work the hours I needed, like if I needed a few hours in the morning to compose myself I could stay back later that night, with new management I am not able to do this anymore. 
I can't bring myself to go into work this week. I can't bring myself to tell my boss that I can't come in. I have booked an appointment with my psych for Thursday. I've got a mortgage and a car to pay off and I'm terrified if something happens to my job I'm screwed. 
I don't even know if I'm looking for advice, but typing this out has helped me process some of the crap running through my head at least. Aaahhhh

Hello,
First time posting here and I don’t usually reach out like this, but.......
So I’ve had (suffered) from Major Depression and GAD since adolescence (I turned 39 in June), been hospitalised for it, lost jobs because of it, there’s nothing here that most of you can’t relate to so I won’t bore you all to death. But lately (over a year) I just feel so numb to everything, to me there is just no happiness to be found anywhere. Like most of you, I slap a smile on my face around people so I don’t burden anyone with my problems, but It’s getting harder to keep the smile there and even harder to pretend that I’m interested in anything.
I just want to curl up into a ball and be left alone............. but at the same time I want to feel better and get excited about life again. Anyway I think I just needed to get these thoughts out of my mind and onto “paper.” Feel free to disregard

Hi, im recently new here, i have joined to ask for advice from a different point of view and support people that are also struggling any way i can.
I have struggled with depression a long time now and its recently been getting worse i have been asking myself what is the point of living anymore, whats the point of getting out of bed, i have skipped appointments, meals just daily things cause i dont see a point of anything anymore. I am confused and been struggling with my identity as a person and in the society we now live in. 
I tried working and thought i was doing fine for a while but after a couple of months i started getting really down to the point i was admitted in hospital. Every time i went to work it felt like i was being put in a bind, being pulled down, suffocating looking around every corner for a exit to breathe and be free , i wanted to stop freaking out and stop making so many mistakes, to be calm to not dread the next awaiting day again and again, to the point i stopped going to work and quit. I tried to work at other places but also felt the same pain over and over again.
I have stopped trying to be in relationships because i have a feeling no one will love me until i love myself which to be honest i never have in my entire life.
I hate myself so much i feel useless and worthless and cant understand how people get up in the mornings now or gets up at all.
I dont see the point of working, eating, or living but i still try cause i know i still have loved ones around me and care for me so i do not give up entirely because of them, i may have given up on myself but they have not given up on me so i will continue fighting even if i live a depressing life its good enough to me to be there for them in return for what they done for me.
Im lost and cant see much ahead of me right now, all i can see is tears, so here i am reaching out.... please help me

Hi. 
As the title says, I really just don’t know. I just know I need to talk and I don’t know how. 
I did have someone to talk to, for a while. She was the best part of my life. She was always there when I needed her. She’s the only person I’ve ever talked to about my real thoughts and feelings. I still fell, but she was always there to pick me up. 
We broke up about a year and a half ago, after being together for a bit more than a year. Ever since I’ve had no one to pick me up. I haven’t talked to anyone since either. Not in the way I used to talk to her. There’s another void left in me where she used to fit. Just another void among dozens.
I guess I should explain exactly how I feel. 
Some days it’s just nothingness. Other days I feel everything at once. The nothingness isn’t a neutral nothingness. It’s a slow, sad nothingness. Like everything is difficult and I can barely move. And when I say I feel everything at once, I mean that I’m attacked by negative emotions. Anger, sadness, regret, guilt. Plus any number of other feelings my brain feels like torturing me with on that day.
It comes and goes. It’s been happening for the past six years, give or take. I feel just fine, happy even, for a while. Maybe a day, maybe a week, maybe a month. But I always fall again. 
It was especially bad in years 11 and 12 of school. I thought I just hated school and I’d be fine when I started uni because I’d be studying what I love to do. I’m now doing that course. 
Yet I still fall. And I’m struggling more and more to pick myself up. I should be loving life right now. I’m young, have amazing friends and I’m studying something I love.
So why do I feel like this? All my passion is gone. I’m failing assessments because I just don’t care.
I need to talk to someone, but the only time I’m capable of talking about it is also the only time I don’t want to talk about it.
My mother is an absolutely lovely person, and I know that if I tell her about how I feel she will blame herself for being a failure of a parent. I can’t do that to her. My father, on the other hand, just wouldn’t care if I told him. He’d just tell me it’s all in my head. As for my friends, I know they’d be there for me. I can guarantee that they would do whatever it takes to help me. But I don’t want to impose on other people’s lives with my problems. They all have problems of their own, and I’d hate to see them inconvenience themselves for me. 
I need help but can’t ask for it. I guess this is my first step.

Hi All,
 
First post. I am a 31yo male who needs some help. I have depression and anxiety. I am having a major issue with pornography addiction.
I am finding myself in a never ending cycle. I am lonely and depressed, so I look up porn obsessively. But then that makes me feel even more depressed and upset/ sad as I had promised myself to never look at it again. It just continues and continues.....
It is effecting my work as I have lost all self confidence, made me anxious etc..... I have never been good socially, but I am becoming more and more socially withdrawn.
Does anyone know of some good self help, plans, books etc to break this porn addiction. I don't know what else to do ?
I've tried web filters/ blockers in the past, they work for a while, then I convince myself to disable the filter what ever way possible. Even if I hide the passwords from myself. I still find a way....

Hi,
New here/to beyond blue in general.
I don't necessarily think I have depression but I don't also quite know what's up with my mental health (In my mid-twenties for reference).
I had to have 2 weeks off work due to a surgery, which has caused me to stay in bed/home. This has resulted in me spending a lot of time thinking about this thing we call life. I could sense that over the past couple of months I've been a little down, but in these 2 weeks, I've really had the grand old question of 'what is the meaning of life?', constantly come up in my mind.
Sure I haven't had a boyfriend in the past 5 years or so, but I don't necessarily think that me being with someone just all of a sudden means life is ace. I'm sure after years of being with someone and having a family, I will eventually come back to this question.What is the actual purpose of life? We get married, we have kids, we have fun and travel the world, but what does this all mean?
Don't get me wrong, I have a very strong community around me currently, and have many friends. I literally had people visit me every 2nd day whilst recovering. But still can't shake this weird feeling of emptiness/lack of clarity about life. I see my friends, I go to work and sure I have fun along the way, but I find myself sometimes just counting down hours and days for no real reason. It's like I'm just counting down time until I die of old age or something! 
It's actually all quite hard to explain, in terms of what I'm actually feeling. It's this weird thing that I only really think about when I'm alone or at night before I go to sleep.
Anywho, not sure what the answer is but figured I should write this all down somewhere.
Cheers,

Hi
i’ve battled depressed and anxiety for years, but felt like i’ve been managing well the last few years. Then on Tuesday it hit me again at full force. Went from the night before feeling pretty good, to having to leave work feeling dreadful  - panicky, nauseous, and generally feeling like everything is pointless. It’s the worst i’ve felt in a long time if ever. I’ve got a supportive husband, and two young kids and I feel guilty i’m putting them through this. I’m trying to do things to help me feel better, getting outside etc but I only having small moments of slight release. Hoping getting off my chest and hearing how others have got through sudden bouts of severe depression/anxiety might help.

Hi there, I was wondering if anyone can tell me why I go down in my mood and feel hopeless, anxious, depressed, sad and have absolutely no pleasure in life. It’s been going like this for almost 4 years. The strange thing is that by the evening at around 5-6 pm 99% of the time it lifts and I feel more relaxed and I feel more sociable. The depression seems to last about 7 days and then it goes away along with all the negativity that comes with it for it too only last one week or maybe two. There are even times it could last for two months for something to happen and I feel it gradually come back and I’m in the thick of it for another week. I feel it was dysthymia it would be a constant feeling of being sad and constantly negative. But it’s just not the case. I’ve found it hard to work for the last 4 years and I’ve only convinced my psychiatrist to put me on a mood stablizer with my current AD. I’ve been on ADs for twenty years and it’s served me well but I’ve had a number of life altering things happen along the way that has shaken my equilibrium. One was being told I had cancer of the liver to be told 3 weeks later that it was nothing. I freaked out quite badly. Then cracks in my marriage started to appear and just as we started to sort that out I got possibly ptsd which completely F’ed me. I was still struggling with that and even during that I was having these ups and downs. A year later my wife left me and I desperately begged and lived on hope for about 3 years of getting her back. It’s been very much a yo-yo since 2014 and I want it too stop. I don’t understand how I can be depressed for a week for it to go away almost completely and I become engaged in the world, out going and feel much lighter and even possibly go on dates for it to come back again a week or two later and be quite debilitated by it. I don’t get it. 
What do you think? I’m sure its not bipolar as I don’t get highs or manic highs, and if it was dysthymia it wouldnt just stay for a week, and then disappear for a while and then strike again. Im at my wits end as my fingers are crossed it will be sorted by the mood stabliser. I cannot keep living like this. It’s just debilitating and soul zapping.

Recently i have started to feel anxious about every conversation ive ever had, it feels like everything i have done and the moments in my life where ive felt fulfilled or happy where all just lies, all my friends are only my friends because they feel sorry for me, or cant shake me. Everyone has just been taking the piss out of me and ive never noticed it. No one has told me when im being stupid or annoying because they're too nice or believed im too nice and did not want to upset me. I cant help but feel, i am just a unintelligent, uninteresting and that i have very poor social skills. I just want someone to tell me the truth so i can work out if it is just my anxiety or something else like low self esteem, or something i can work to recover. I have been diagnosed with Major depressive disorder and Anxiety, and also Borderline Personality disorder. But these thoughts are new and have slowly started to creep in, all these passed events in my life have started to make sense, and im starting to see that maybe people treat me differently. Which sucks, i just want to be normal and have a normal life, and not even be happy. I just dont want to be a charity case. Cheers for any advice

Hi, for about 5-6 years I've been suffering from anxiety and depression (which has been caused by several events during my life), and have recently started seeing a counsellor about it. However I dont receive constant or immediate assistance. Over the last few weeks I feel like I haven't been normal and haven't been doing things I used to. I recently came back from Europe from a study tour and since then I haven't been the same. During the study tour I went through some periods where I felt like I was being bullied, I had some people who studied with me that had called me names and basically cornered me. Also recently, I was once again rejected by a 'close friend' who I have had on and off feelings for since he claims to never feel the same (there's more to that story). But overall I have been going through 'lapses' of depression (like even 2-3 in a day) and I end up spending the entire day in bed with no motivation to do anything. Everyday I feel more lonelier and lonelier, and it's coming to the point where I dont really feel like I have anyone to talk to. So that's why I made the initiative to post here. I just need some support and advice to help myself out of this mess. Thanks a lot.

Hi all,
I'm feeling really down at the moment and feel like i don't have anyone to talk to. I'm struggling a bit in a few areas of my life and I guess a lot of it is involving my social anxiety.
For one - I am struggling at work a bit. I started a new job 4 months ago and while it has been fine I've found it hard to build any work relationships. I feel as though I had a lot of friendships in the very beginning but most of those people have now left. It's a very big company that I work in and it's really odd having so many people around and not really having anyone to talk to. I think this is somewhat the nature of my team as when I see other new people start as well I always see them sitting alone, not really welcomed very openly into the company and while everyone in my team is so nice - no one puts any effort in to really involve any of the newcomers. It's been hard as I am a very shy person and I've just given up on trying with the people at my work in a way. So I spend the whole 38 hours each week sitting at my desk alone not really speaking to anyone and feeling really isolated and alone.
Another issue I'm having is one with my room mate. My room mate is one of my closest friends but I am starting to feel really tired of her and have for a while.. This week she invited my ex up so they could see a concert together (as they are also good friends) and I was okay with this at first, but having him here has really started to make me feel really down. He was supposed to leave on wednesday but he is still here and it's sunday. The two of them have been flirting, laughing going out together for food and shopping and I have just been here in the background and crying in my room. 
Being around him is bringing up so many negative feelings as he is someone who hurt me so badly over and over again. I have tried to stay friends with him as my room mate still is but this is becoming really difficult. The fact that she is being completely inconsiderate of my feelings really hurts as well. I just don't know if i can be friends with her anymore because this is just for me, crossing the line. I am so scared to lose a friend but I really can't take this.. I haven't felt this down in a while and I just want to move on from my past with my ex. I feel like a complete mess.. completely unwanted, unloved and like I'm not worth the time of day as this is how he made me feel in the past. I feel like I am being the problem here for being upset that he is here but really hurts..

my boyfriend and i are both 17 and just started dating a month ago, however we’ve been friends for years. He has depression and i feel like im very useless at trying to help him.
He has family issues where he feels like his whole family hates him and he’s currently dealing with his parents divorce and his dad moving out. He usually talks about how his life sucks and he hates his life but during a call last night, he broke down whilst he was drunk and cried to me about how he couldnt deal with his life anymore.
I continue to tell him im always there to listen to him but i feel like im not giving him the answers/words he needs to hear. i havent dealt with anyone with depression and i really do want to be there for him. 
Can someone give me few advices on this please! i’ve read several articles about how to help someone with depression but i feel like theyre not helping as much because theyre most useful to adults and not teenagers.

I suffer from Anxiety, depression and PTSD and sometimes it gets really bad. but the main reason i am writing this right now is because lately I feel like I don't exist. I barely have any friends and the friends i always end up with end up leaving because of my mental health, i feel alone. 
i wish people actually cared, it is as if i am invisible, i don't know, i feel depressed for no reason at all what so ever. my own best friend only ask me if i am okay if she sees i post something like ""no one even ask if i am okay?"". i don't see a point in being alive, but like i would do anything? i have gone there before and so how hurt my family was. my siblings ignore me and expect me to be like them. i feel like the burden of the family. my siblings have great jobs, they finished school, they aren't quiet. where as i am full of mistakes, i dropped out of school due to the work being to easy for me. i don't want to work with food but all i keep hearing is ""working with food is usually someones first job"".  i have a psychologist and i like her helping but talking verbally isn't my thing when it comes to my problems. i feel as if i am always someones last choice, people say that isn't true but i know it is because i have seen that i am with my own eyes. i get so irritated easily. i just don't know what to do anymore?

Hi, I have just joined and this is my first post. I don’t really have anyone I could ask for advice regarding this matter as I don’t really want them to know.
I think it’s time for me to get help.
For few years now, we’ll actually many years, I haven’t feel well or right. I get episodes of emptiness and sadness and I would want to do nothing. There’s also the unreasonable irritation and annoyance towards everything. When I’m in this state, I’ll just stay on my bed playing pointless games on my phone all day. My husband understands this and has been very supportive. Now that I think about it, he probably has been taking care of our son almost all of the time. He cooks, takes him to school, cleans, makes me coffee and bring meals to my bed when I’m isolating myself from the world. I need to stop this negative moment from happening as this is unfair to him. I barely talk to my son now because I can’t stand anyone talking to me for a long time. I still spend time and talk to him but not as much as I should. 
So this has been going for years now but I felt it worsened the last couple years. More days doing nothing. More masks. More bad thoughts. More urges (No, I’m not suicidal, I wouldn’t do it for my family). I’ve been thinking of going to the gp for help but when I’m out of my cocoon, I don’t feel the need to do it anymore. I also don’t want my family to know. 
Last month my husband’s mother passed away from cancer. My mother in law, that I barely visited the last several months because I was weak. She battled for many years. We always tried to be there for her. We only live 10mins drive away. On my good days I’ll cook and we’d  take it to her place for lunch or dinner. Or my husband will drop her the cake that I made, or we’ll take her out with us to the park. But the last several months, I haven’t been there for her. I was weak and selfish, and I wasn’t there when she needed support the most. We knew she’s fighting cancer but no one knew she was going last month.
So now that I’ve decided to get help, I’m not sure how to do it without my husband knowing. He’s got enough on his plate so I can’t put the worry on him. I’ve thought of talking to him but I know that’s not fair for him. 
Shoul I tell him?
 
••Thank you for taking the time to read this. Sorry if it wasn’t an easy read as I’ve been having difficulty to concentrate or letting words come out of me.

How can I be I so petrified of something happening to me, or getting sick, or not being here for my kids, but at the same time wish I wasn’t here?
Why do I bother to try and heal my injuries, stop my migraines, to feel better, but then intentionally hurt myself a few minutes later?
Why do I desperately await a chance to try and talk to someone about how I am feeling, and then freeze up and waste my time once I’m there?
Why do I spend whole hours consumed in my own hopelessness and self-loathing, then underplay just how desperately bad I am feeling when asked? 
Why do I smile when I want to scream?
How can I see no shame in anyone else’s tears or pain, but am petrified of my own?
Why do I spend ages looking forward to something, planning and saving for it, then spend that whole time finally doing it, wanting to be in bed?
Why do I go bed exhausted, then lay there and not sleep?
How can I keep myself under control some aspects of my life and other parts feel so helpless? 
How do I have so much patience for others, yet such quick judgement for myself? 
How can I want to hurt myself so much but at the same time also want to feel nothing? 
How can I keep getting through each day feeling like this? How can I work forward without a clear and tangible goal or timeline? How can I get the courage to take the help I need without feeling like an enormous burden? How can I justify my behavior to myself? How can I get some relief without letting anyone down? How can I even work out what the hell my problem is?

Hey, 
I'm new here, I haven't really spoken about this stuff publicly, maybe with a few friends and those who are close to me, but I wanted to put my feeling out there, what depression feels like to me. For me it's like a rollercoaster at times, I have my ups and I have my downs and sometimes it's just smooth sailing. But when I'm feeling the downs they feel to me like an extreme feeling of tiredness, I feel beyond exhausted, like I pulled an all-nighter and only got 30 minutes of sleep, but on top of that I try to sleep and I can't sleep, the insomnia hits and no matter how much I try I can't fall asleep. I feel like I'm trying to fix something, I'm not sure what, but no matter how hard I try to fix it, it never gets fixed.
For me, depression is like being in a small pitch black room with no light, no entrance and no exit. The only thing in there is a TV and I'm watching the TV on the screen is my life as it plays on, but I can't control it like there is a producer and a director in control of what I do, think and say. If you have ever seen the movie 'Get Out' by Jordan Peele I would recommend watching it, there's a scene with the ""sunken place"" it feels very similar.
Anyway to continue, I would say I'm a logical person in the way I think, its like I have a cabinet made of glass with all my feelings, worries and precious things stacked in there, and when I'm put on the spot its like someone has gotten a rock and thrown it at the cabinet, destroying it and spreading everything everywhere, and I have to spend ages picking everything up and placing it in its rightful position.
I have no idea if anyone can relate but that for me is what depression is.
Thank you.

I had been bullied in the workplace and was diagnosed with severe depression which was confirmed by my employer's doctor through Fitness For Duty Assessment about 2 years ago.
In the medical report the doctor said that I can go back to my own position if the ""ISSUE"" was addressed.
I was off from work and back to work through graudally return to work programe. Then I was arranged to work in another other area and one day my department told that I was approved for not going back to my old position.
Two years later, my department told me that I became ""Unattached"" and forced me to take a package via a deed of agreement. If I am not agree I will move to next step which is forced redundacy.
Since I have my first depression in the workplace, my situation never be better and my department just try to get rid of me by telling me I became EXCESS.
Can someone tell me what can I do?
Many thanks in advance.

Hi all, Newbie here
I've been experiencing periods of time, usually at night, where I get incredibly sad for no reason. Sometimes it can be triggered by thinking about something that happened earlier in the day, other times spontaneously. My body shakes, I get these horrible thoughts about myself and I cry for hours either way. 
A few years ago, my mother took me to a psychiatrist who told me I had mild depression and a mood disorder. I saw her 2 more times, and then stopped because apparently me going was part of a trial program. My mother said if I went there afterwards that it would appear on my record, which according to her wouldn't look good to employers.
I recently did the K10 (I think that is what it is called) test and the results suggested to talk to someone about what I am experiencing. However, I am far too intimidated by the concept of going to someone (a professional) under my own steam. I don't have friends that I am close enough to be comfortable talking to either. Both my mother and partner have a ""harden up"" type of attitude as well which doesn't help.
I know I could google self help tips but for once I would really like someone to tell me what I should be doing. Everyone just expects me to know how to live like a functioning adult but I jist need some help this time yknow. Sorry if this is a little scattered, just needed to get it off my chest.
Any advice with how to deal with the sadness is appreciated ta

I admit I’m a crier but lately that has been replaced by anger. It’s liking I’m telling myself that sadness makes me weak and anger is more powerful, but I feel so out of control when I’m angry,
i hide my severe depression and anxiety but sometimes I cry and can’t hide it and people just tell me it’s ok and don’t cry. I then feel ashamed for crying and the cycle of anger starts over again. I don’t know how to manage  this. My emotions are so out of control and when this happens I can’t cope.
anyone can help or offer advice? I’m really alone I have no one to talk to

Bit of backstory: I have a very small, very close family. My only uncle is currently fighting stage 4 brain cancer and no matter what they do he's terminal. My mum is his next of kin because he is also divorced. She is falling apart because if it all. She is so depressed. It takes nothing at all to make her cry and she's too tired to cook, clean or do anything she usually does. 
 
My mum has admitted to me, because she knows of my struggles, that she feels she needs help but she doesn't deserve it because it's my uncle that's sick not her. She's taking her anger and frustration out on me with smart comments about how I don't do enough excercise or chores even though I've spent the last three days doing all her laundry, cooking, shopping, cleaning etc with some help from dad whilst in full care of my 7 week old son. I'm EXHAUSTED. I'm a new first time mum trying to get used to my new life and enjoy my son but I constantly feel like I can't. I'm constantly thinking to myself 'hurry up and stop feeding' or 'go to sleep already' because I need to do more for my mum... 
tired and fed up...

Hi, I'm new here. Not sure where to start. I am a single mum of 1, I work and I am doing my PhD. I've never felt like I really belonged anywhere or that I was ever good enough. I act really extraverted around people and everyone knows me for my laugh and being ""smart"". But then I cry my eyes out behind closed doors (usually!).I get very depressed and have terrible pms. I am getting to a point where I just can't contain my emotions anymore and people are starting to notice and it makes me feel even more worried and terrible. I turned 30 and got drunk at my party and completely flew off the handle... Now everyone thinks I'm crazy. I am trying to apologize to everyone but the damage is done. I saw a doctor a few months ago about severe insomnia and they just told me ""to wait and see"" and that they wouldn't prescribe me anything. I told them I couldnt cope at the time and I just left feeling like there wasn't any solution given but to ""buck up"". I'm worried that even though I'm a good mum and my son is completely taken care of (and probably spoilt), that if I seek further help that I will be labelled crazy and have my child raising ability questioned. I have desperately wanted another child for so many years and now if I did people would think I was doing the wrong thing. So I have to maybe give up my long held desires. I'm just not sure what to do at this point....

The following is a link to an interview discussing why a large percentage of young people suffer the effects of depression more than at any other time in history. Please watch it (YouTube) and discuss your thoughts here with others...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As8XkJNaHbs
As a parent it wasn't easy to hear their comments, but as with all generations, I passed on good and bad thru my parenting because; 'we learn as we go', and that's forgivable.
I think their comments need to be heard and digested. Hopefully it'll resonate with many here, so please, write and chat among yourselves. I'm sure you all have your stories and opinions...
If disagreements occur, that's fine as long as people are respectful and accept that sometimes not agreeing's ok. Could both young and older people please allow for (or applaud) and respect generational experiences (or inexperience) and insight?
The main focus of this thread is depression and its causative factors in children, adolescents and young adults. The interview focuses on generalisations so it doesn't address trauma. 
(As a side note:) Do you think what [he's] saying could be translated into dealing with (or not) trauma responses in young people?
Kind regards;
Sez

So this can be both metaphorical and physical. Today it was physically - I'm finding it hard to speak when I'm low and nobody really understands it, and they can be really nasty about it. I don't know what to do in these situations, and I usually dissociate heavily when it's happening. This morning I was sitting with my friends and I couldn't even look them in the eyes - I was just so low I felt like I was suffocating. I think not being able to speak is mainly because I feel like I'm suffocating, and I've found ever since this feeling has emerged I've gained a fear of having my nose and/or mouth covered (because lack of breathing) even when snorkelling. 
I don't know how to stop this feeling. It's been going on for so long I just expect it now, and it's as if my depression is getting worse. It's hard to explain, it's literally as if someone has their fist around my throat and I can't speak or will myself to. I can go hours or days without speaking, and this makes my friends and family upset/mad.
How do I explain this to them? 
How do I stop this from happening?
Metaphorically not being able to speak involves me being too afraid to talk to people about certain things - but I guess everyone experiences this at some point or another, so it's not my biggest concern.

To
paraphrase: My Boyfriend of 6 months started declining in behavior
significantly after the first 2 months and it's reached a point where
he won't socialise with anyone, make any decisions on what to do, what to eat, or where to go... but will just sit there awkwardly all
the time. He won't even interact with me, yet he still comes over
every weekend. He has existing depression issues of 10 years or more that haven't
completely come to light till now and i'm worried about him. 
I myself struggle a bit. I'm 27 and i haven't had a lasting relationship for 6 years. I've dated more than a few that have depression/bipolar/anxiety issues, and each failure has taken it's toll on me. I feel like it's selfish of me to abandon ship and get back out there, but his actions have left me feeling empty, unattractive and feeling like a total stranger, i almost feel obligated to stay with him. But do I
keep going with his road to recovery, regardless of my own mental
state? Or do I let him go? I'm not sure i'm properly equipped to help
him... but i feel terrible for even thinking of leaving him.

Hello,
Where do I begin. My professional working life has been absolute hell since it began when I was 16. I'm 33 years old now. I have never been fired for misconduct but have been made redundant from all 14 positions I have had. 
basically at the 1.5 year mark the people I work with realise they cannot stand me and start to exclude me, talk about me behind my back, and generally bully me. 
Unfortunately when this begins it is a matter of weeks before I get the boot. They never mention anything about my work ethic or quality but excuse the redundancy as a financial burden and rather condescendingly inform me that they reluctantly have to let me go.
I quit my last position on the first sign of bullying as I knew this would be the subsequent result. I can get a job easily, my skills are in high demand, however I don't think I can live like this for the rest of my life, hopping from one job to another, until inevitable bullying and redundancy.
I don't know what it is about me that makes people hate me so much. I can spend hours sitting and thinking what it could be.
One thing is for sure, I cannot face employment anymore. I have no idea how I'm going to survive but I cannot face it. It's too much for too little. I honestly do not understand how anyone can go through a day at work a be smiling by the end of it.
I have worked hard every job I have had but it doesn't matter, hard work never gets you anywhere, social skills is all that matters in this world. Literally the be all or end all.

Hi,
So I’ve had depression and anxiety for years now. I see a Psych when I can (Work commitments make it tricky) and generally keep things under control and practice lots of healthy coping mechanisms (exercise, keeping social, relaxation techniques, I try meditation). But recently I’ve been finding myself uncontrollably angry. It’s like the little things start nagging me and I get more and more annoyed until I snap and become a raging psychopath. When it happens, I feel nothing except anger and occasionally a hint of sadness. I feel void of all other emotion. I don’t care who I hurt, just so long as I hurt them. I know I will regret it later on, and my mind thinks ‘good. You deserve to suffer’. 
 
I plan to see my psych but I can’t get in this week. So does anyone else have problems with anger with their depression? I find once the anger wears off I become completely overwhelmed with pain and desperation, and fear that I will never get better. I’m hurting the people I love and I can’t seem to help it. I’m so desperate I feel like I’m going to crack and break down. I don’t even know what started all this but I can’t seem to get a grip :’(

My psychologist cancelled my appointment, which means my next one is a whole month from now. This is the 1st time in my life seeing a psych, & I'm starting to become needy for it, which frightens me. In the past, I stuffed my pain down, which allowed me to function like an automaton (or a walking corpse). I was stiflingly numb. But ever since revealing my pain to him, it's like I've opened a pandora's box of suffering, & I can't shut it. It feels awful to open my wounds, only to stitch it back up again after the 50 minute session is up, & having to wander around with fresh wounds for two weeks till it's time for another session. I'm halfway through the bulk billed sessions, & won't be able to afford the full price of the sessions, so I feel like I'm in a worse situation than I was before, b/c at least previously, I could (or at least I could pretend to) stuff my feelings down & remain numb & distracted to it, but ever since I started talking about it, I can't seem to shut that box anymore. It's crept to the surface of my mind & is bleeding all over my daily life. I just know I won't have scratched the surface of my past trauma by the time the 10 sessions are up. I'll just be one big fat walking wound. We're talking about a life time of misery that I have to address. Childhood physical/emotional abuse, sexual assault, job issues, toxic relationships, low self esteem etc. It's like by seeing a psychologist, I've become addicted to talking about my problems & my pain, that I'm constantly like a drug addict waiting for my next fix every fortnight. Anyone relate to these feelings?

Hi there, I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about six years ago but it never really felt right in terms of what I experienced so I didn't take on what I felt was a label - and my psychologist agreed at the time. Many years ago I did go manic when I was on medication (ironically I was scared of taking anti-depressants and they did send me over the edge). I did start taking a different medication and felt things were a lot easier. I had been stable for 10 years (including having two kids). But about a year ago I separated from my partner (of 25 years). It was my choice and was perhaps the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Straight after the separation, I felt quite liberated. I moved house, started doing lots of courses, hanging out with friends. Underneath all this was absolute exhaustion and despair at the feeling of having to be separated from my kids when co-parenting. But in March this year I stupidly took drugs - way too much of it. I pretty much never take drugs. The following week I became deeply depressed and it never seemed to wear off. But just this past week I feel like I am rapidly going from top of the world, I can do anything, to bottom, completely falling apart and crying all the time, utter despair. I have a PhD due at the end of this month and I was hoping to keep it together for the next three weeks. The weird thing is, I feel like I did when I was a teenager (I'm finding friendship difficult, feel excluded/abandoned by little things, and no longer want to go out). I don't really know where to begin. I know when I had serious depression in the past, it usually was preceded by the feeling of hitting the bottom (a breakdown/release), needing to acknowledge it. This is where I'm at, I guess.

Hi. 22 years with Antidepressants. One day I asked myself, Why I'm eating these?? End of last year I spoke with my Doctor, we cut it to half. I felt so good, I FELT,,,, I HAD FEELINGS, happy, sad, joyful, loved it. Too eagerly within a month I stopped taking any at all.. I wanted to be rid of them altogether. Then it happened, my anger got unmanageable, took over. I felt ready to hurt somebody.. Yes, I felt like that......... It did really SCARE me, I'm not that kind of a person... Saw my Doctor again, got back to my half doze. 2 months later I cut my tablets to half. Felt more Depressed than ever, headache was unbelievable.
Now I been without 4weeks, starting to feel great, my energy levels rising, (no more lying in bed all day), got energy to vacuum, to take care of my home/me, cooking again. Sewing machine is out of cupboard, I got energy for 2-3hr's a day. It's a start.. GREAT START!! .
As I can feel again, I feel so strange with my head, we think differently than before. It's like having TWO heads, one of my old old busy go and do things type, and this new strange one. It got to relearn 22 years of my lost life. It feel's like at I been Zombie for last 22 years. What have I missed of life? lots and lots I think.. Now I cry a lot, feelings what I missed. Laugh a lot, laughter what i missed.... Every day feel's like at I'm a toddler, learning to walk again with a new legs. It's not legs, it's learning to think with my new brain. As I don't know, what it feel's one minute to next.. As I like to be in control, posed, ready, unexpected situations could whack me out of comfort zone. What do I do then?? As I don't have a control of my feelings, they are so new and RAW.. Thanks to reading my stuff

Hi,
I am in the middle of what someone described as a breakdown. Things have just gotten too much to handle and I’m struggling. I have seen a dr who has put me on anti-depressants and recommended a psychologist. The dr has mentioned a diagnosis of Bipolar. 
Just interested to hear from anyone who has been diagnosed with bipolar, how do you manage it personally and how do you cope with it?
its all a bit scary to be honest. Usually I’m always on the go and doing things but since this episode I just find myself sitting there sort of like a goldfish, not being able to remember what I’m doing. I guess I’m just hoping that it does get better and I’ll be back to “normal”

I feel more alone than ever and have a loving husband and two children.
I have stopped answering calls from family and feel like i cant talk to anyone and just cry all the time.
I feel my depression (now diagnosed), has made me even lonelier since I cant talk to anyone about my feelings
and randomly walk around watching others that appear so happy and in groups wondering how i become that happy and connected.
The only place I can express myself is online to strangers like this forum!
Have I caused my own loneliness?

My bf has gone away back to Ireland for a holiday and I am left here in Australia in our little apartment by myself. I don’t have many friends here as many have moved back to Ireland, so I am feeling so alone. I have felt myself slowly sinking back into a dark place like I used to. I have suffered with depression before and had to be signed off work  in the past as it got really bad. I have had a pretty good couple of years with only a few little episodes where it gets bad for a couple of weeks. I just feel trapped inside my own head. It’s a viscous circle where I don’t want to speak to or see anyone because I feel so down but then because I isolate myself it gets even worse. I know its starting again. I can’t sleep at nights and I’m exhausted but never want to leave my bed. I don’t want to do anything and can’t even watch TV all I am doing is thinking. I am taking my mood out on my bf, being insecure, snappy, nasty and pushing him away. I am jealous that he is enjoying himself at home with his friends and family whilst I am here by myself in this dark place. I feel so embarrassed that I am like this and I feel that I can’t talk to anyone about it not even my bf. I am paranoid too and so anxious that he won’t come home, or he will fall in love with someone else etc. God, I sound so crazy. Will I ever get better and how? I just feel like the worst type of person and I don’t deserve love or friends.

Okay, so I've been doing pretty well this year, haven't had any serious relapses. However, I am doing the HSC this year and am falling back into my depressive episodes. Aside from that, I think I get what I'm supposed to be doing right? But whenever I'm on a forum here, or anywhere online for that matter, people are always wanting someone to talk to. As am I. But the problem is, for me its just so hard to really appreciate or gain anything from this when its not even in person. I really like hugs. Like really, really. I like fluffy people because I can tell they give great hugs. But no matter how little I care for societal perceptions and expectations; it just wouldn't be right if I hugged someone else's mum (especially if I don't know those people). Which was irrelevant information, sorry. 
But what I'm saying is, it would be so nice, if I could find people to sit with and talk with and maybe make some friends. It seems like there's not many opportunities for that anywhere around here - which sucks. And I honestly feel like I want to make a family out of people that are friends, but I don't have any friends to  begin with which is difficult. And I've been putting the whole thing off because HSC and Uni apps are so much to think about...idk. I guess I just don't think that making friends with people is going to happen anytime soon.

Hi guys,


Just tapping into a communal knowledge base here. Thanks for reading.


I am diagnosed as having Bipolar Disorder, I am on medication for this, which seems to have performed miracles for my depression. I have been hospitalised for BP several times, for a manic episode, a mixed episode and twice for depression.


A possible BPD diagnosis has never been brought up by any of the psychiatrists that I’ve seen. In fact, I’ve asked and it has been denied by 3 different professionals. However I feel that my symptoms have a lot in common with BPD, mostly the abandonment issues, and then there is the obvious overlap of mood instability with BP.


I have been with my partner for nearly 7 years and also enjoyed long-term relationships before this. However my partner and I have been struggling lately due to a relocation and him starting a high pressure job with long hours. We have been on the verge of breaking up and started seeing a relationship therapist.


A central theme within this therapy are my abandonment issues. I experience tremendous anxiety and/or rage when he has to go on yet another business trip, arrives home late or is not truthful about his whereabouts. I come from a family of junkies and lies about whereabouts/what they were up to/not returning home resulting in me living with family members, and 2 foster homes, were normal for me. In this context one might be able to see how this sort of trauma would affect future relationships.


Our relationship therapist has floated complex PTSD on my part, this as well as several issues my husband is facing with lying and confrontation. Meaning we are on opposite ends of the spectrum as I need accountability and truth to make sure I’m ‘safe’ from past experiences. If not I can become hypervigilant, anxious and erratic. He says he lies because a confrontation can result in strong emotions on my part and round and round in circles we go.


From my understanding complex PTSD is often interchangeable with BPD with the main difference being the abandonment issues. Obviously not negating the overlap with BP as well and one can see a red herring emerging.


My psychiatrist denies both the complex PTSD and the BPD and says everyone, including him, has abandonment issues. My reactions are perfectly in line with what to expect when a partner lies and walks out to avoid confrontation according to him.


Should I ask for a second opinion? What do you think?

I have some symptoms of depression and add/adhd
i always have the symptoms of ADD such as forgetfulness and lack of concentration, and I’m usually fidgety and uncomfortable in one spot.
1-2 weeks ago I had my worst episode of depression like stuff. I didn’t feel positivity once for about 2 weeks. I felt useless, and down more than usual, and family got angry because I couldn’t do basic tasks. 
I always move very slowly and I never have motivation for anything, even the few things I enjoy. I’ve also lost interest and pleasure in most things the past 1-2 Year’s and now the only things I can enjoy regularly are video games and music. 
These things cause me huge problems at home and school. At school I leave big assessments for home and do none at school, but then wait until their almost due and take way longer than I should and almost fall asleep doing it. At home I can’t even remember and follow basic instructions and I always make ridiculous mistakes. 
I’m only 15 and the only stress I have is at home when family get annoyed because of my uselessness.
i need to know what I could be diagnosed with, because I want to be sure before I get help or my parents get help for me.

Hey Guys
Long story short, I have had depression before (though am not sure if it was mild or not), used to self-harm and saw GP. Was never in therapy or meds but managed to get back on track using this 'life alignment' thing the doctor did, after a good year of working at it. This was in 2012.
I often fall into depressive states, but they usually only last a day and then I am back at it with my usual motivation. However, I am really struggling this week.
My partner is away for work for 2 weeks and won't be home in a while. I recently started watching anime and since he was away I started to binge watch in bed. Long story short, I watched 500 episodes and completed a series, watched 2 movies and 63 episodes of a new series in the span of 3 days. I didn't leave bed unless I was going to the toilet, I ate only 2 pieces of toast one day and 4 the next and a breakfast biscuit on the third. I didn't have a shower, I didn't even change clothes.
My muscles were in so much pain from just laying on my sides all the time it made it hard to sleep. I stayed up until 6 am one night then slept until 11. My whole life is falling apart and I don't know how to pick it back up. I am a uni student and still have until the 30th before school starts. I want to keep writing a book I have going, but I am struggling to even hold it together.
Finishing the anime series has made me feel worse like I have lost a part of myself. It's like I convinced myself for 3 days that was my world and heading to work last night (night filler, 3 hours easy work) was like a bucket of cold water on my face that the world is shit. It's so annoying because I like these adventure shows where they work hard and train hard for rewards but I can't even leave the bed. Now I am binge eating one meal of McDonalds or dominoes a day and eating nothing else all day.
I managed to get up today but I still haven't gotten dressed and I really just want to go lay back down. I have no friends since we moved here recently and my partner is two hours away. I was at work and was coming up with excuses to go home, like saying my dad was in hospital. I know I only do that when I am super depressed. I was on the verge of tears all night and it was so hard to keep it together even though it's such a short shift.
I feel like if my partner was home I would probably get it together because he would be like let's get out of bed and have a shower, even if that was all I did. But I can't gain the motivation myself.

Hi, I’m new here and I’m not sure whether I’m fine or actually have depression.
I’m confused because when I’m talking people I’m fine and quite loud and bubbly. But when I’m by myself or not talking, my mind attacks itself or something. Something is telling me that I’m worthless and hopeless and all I can do is believe “it”. It’s weird because lots of things still motivate me..
Thanks.

I will start by saying that I have suffered with depression for about 15 years. A couple of years ago I found who I thought was my soulmate, but all he did was take advantage of my kindness and just used my emotions up like a sponge. Today i took the first step by telling him that i will not accept this treatment anymore and i need a week without contact so i can self reflect.
I have PCOS, chronic pain and chronic insomnia (the later two caused from an accident 6 years ago) I take meds to sleep and for the PCOS and losing weight is pretty much impossible. I could eat a salad leaf and still gain weight. I do know that if i exercise every day that i can lose weight, i just lack the motivation. I recently bought a treadmill and hope to walk every day, But i am having difficulty with motivation.
I have had some dark times due to my depression and apart from steps every day, i really need some help in some basic everyday steps i can take to help with my motivation, and motivational posters and sayings dont help, just annoy me. I found that doing small things like drinking a glass of tea at night, with a heatpack, which has helped in the past with stress to relax me a little, I just need more ideas.
Sometimes I dont even feel like i have the energy or motivation to brush my teeth, shower or eat.
Ideas anyone?

I am reaching out for some tips or to gain more perspective about depression. I have depression and am responding well to medications and therapy. I feel great. My partner entered into the darkest place yet. been going on about 7 months now its overwhelming for him and i. He admitted he needed help which was amazing as he never has before and is back on the game in terms of trial and error of medications. The side effects hit him like a tonne of bricks i feel so mich pain for him.  Always tired, Headaches upset tummy. And no change to his mood. Still trying to find the combo for him. He gave up years ago after 3 years on unsuccessful medications.He uses marajuana as it is the only thing that keeps him calm. Alot of it and i dont like condoning it. But i do beacuse when he doesnt have it nothing can ease his cripling amxiety.
His anger and anxiety is causing me frustration. We have dogs to help us. He is linked at the hip to them both and he doesnt like walking due to weight gain. Lake of motivation. Anxiety. Especially anxiety about the dogs. Other people walking their dogs. He doesnt seem to trust me walking them. I am a bit more go with the flow now that i am feeling more like myself.
I love the dogs but i am able of leaving them for a holiday in the right hands of freinds and dog hotels... but he will never accept that. I can cope for a while but i am struggling to see a way clear
I cant even take the dogs for a walk cause he gets upset and anxious and begs me to understand his perspective but i am at the point now where i need to walk them with or without him for their health. Not mine or his. Theirs. Its the same for shopping. Sometimes i bite my tongue from saying just get over yourself and come. The dogs are fine. But i know how much thay would piss me off when i am in my own hole. However after a certain length of time i struggle to be as easy going to just accept it.His mother is here and she helps out at home cookinf cleaning etc and it makes him annoyed cause her cleaning makes him feel bad. I appreciate it so much. I am exhausted with coping to work and manage myself and look after myself aswell as being there and support.
I am jist getting exhausted of so much anxiety and negativity from him.We cant drive anywhere far. If we do ever walk the dogs its stressful and he is full of anxiety and makes a scene and i cannot tell him to be logical. He usually is logical
Any advice from someone in a similar boat ever. Advice from a male who can relate?

Hi all,
Just did the typical 'Dr Google' and typed into the text box, ""I don't have anything that interests me"" - top hit - this website.
I'm not entirely sure if I have depression, however here is my story.
A few years ago I suffered a shoulder injury which required surgery and a lot of rehabilitation and has not returned to normal function. A year or two later my wife and I welcomed our beautiful daughter, and I subsequently took a new job elevating to Management in a large company and we purchased our first home. Sounds like a good progression right?
Now two years later, I don't have anything that interests me, or motivates me. My job is very demanding and I feel a void moving away from the engineering role I was previously in. I work long hours, and look after my daughter on the weekends (which I love, however can be exhausting after a long week). My wife and I also have another girl on the way which is exciting, however I don't feel the same excitement I did with my first daughter, I'm not sure whether this is because I'm so busy or not!
Prior to all of this I was happy, motivated and generally enjoyed things. I feel it's the job I'm in which is possibly bringing me down, however it's making me feel terrible at times. I find myself lazy, taking shortcuts not doing day to day things like organising a car service - it just seems too hard.
Sorry for the long post. Not sure who to chat to before I see someone.
Thanks.

I’ve suffered depression for over 20 years but in the last 10months  my depression has gotten worse. 
Lately I feel like my body mind and heart can’t deal with how I’m feeling at the moment. I feel like I’m at capacity and I just don’t know what to do. Most mornings I wake up vomiting and then I cry most days. I’m exhausted and can barely do anything. I’m finding it hard to see that I will get better and get my life back. I don’t want to feel this way and some days I would do anything not to feel so sad and depressed. 
can anyone help?

Hi All, 
I'm new here. I've had depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. When I'm well, I'm a zainy, intelligent, creative people person but I'm going through a particularly long patch of depression.
 I just really needed someone today but discussing this is pretty exhausting, especially when it's in person, so I'm posting here instead. I'm tired of being sad. I'm tired of carrying it. I'm just so tired. The most difficult thing is that I feel like I have no options. It's not like there is anything tangible to point at to say, ""See, look, there you go I'm actually sick"". Half the time I think I'm just making it up and that, if I weren't so lazy, I could be happy and productive if I needed to. I feel like the people around me expect so much and that on the days where I'm sinking in it, which at the moment is most days, I just can't do it. I think they will think I'm incompetent, lazy or negligent. I want to have a big open wound to point at so I can say, ""Look that's why I couldn't get that work done over the weekend"" or ""See that's why I couldn't pick up the phone when you called"". 
So I guess my question to you all is. 
Is this real? Is it as tangible as having pneumonia or cancer or breaking a bone? and How do I keep going on with so much weight on my shoulders? 
In sincerity, 
WaterVeil

Hi everyone,
Just recently joined the forum and would really appreciate some advice or have someone share with me their experience of telling their partner about their depression.
A little about me:
I am a male, 25 years old and ex-military. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder in 2015 following my return from an overseas deployment to the middle-east. Early this year I was diagnosed with ADHD sub-type inattentive following a neuropsychological assessment.
As of today, my social anxiety disorder is quite well-managed thanks to some CBT that I received a few years ago however, my depression has been ongoing since 2015 and I have been on and off medication since then. As for my ADHD, I currently am trying to find the right treatment to alleviate my symptoms through medication. I'm on my 2nd trial of stimulant medication, but I am finding that it has been hard to find a middle ground between the benefit and negative symptoms associated with the stimulant medication. I am currently taking two medications daily, though to little effect towards controlling my symptoms.
As time goes by I find that my depression, though sporadic, has become worse and the medication is doing little to help. I feel that quite soon I am going to find it very difficult to cope and will need more support, with the potential for admission to a mental health facility.
This issue I have is that as a result, I will no longer be able to hide my condition from my partner. We've been together almost 3 years now and are engaged, we both want a future together and a family. I, however, can't come to terms with telling her about my depression. Regardless of how irrational it may seem, I feel that as a man I need to be strong and be able to carry this burden on my own. I feel like by telling my partner about my condition it will change the dynamic of our relationship, and that her perception of me will change from her provider and protector to someone she can't look towards for strength, that my reactions to an event from then on will be indicative of my condition. Once that has happened there will be no going back from it and I will be forever constrained to that persona.
I figure that if anyone can give me some advice or share their experiences with telling their partner of their condition it may help me take the necessary step towards talking with her about it.
Hope to hear from you guys soon.
Regards,
K

I’m 30 years old. I’ve been feeling weird and depressed since I was a little boy.  I’ve never been able to make friends. I have a few who live far away from me, but I am so lonely in the small town I moved to for work. I cant talk to someone unless they talk to me first, and even then I can’t look them in the eye. I have no social skills.  I’ve never been interested in drinking or going to pubs, I feel too anxious in crowds. I don’t have many hobbies and have always worked myself hard at work since age 17.  The men who work for me are in their sixties, so we have nothing in common. 
I cling to women and constantly feel petrified of being left alone. My current partner has cheated on me with three different men and I let her get away with it because I can not bare to come home to an empty house and then spend years alone here with my own thoughts.

Hi Everyone,
just needing a place to vent. I’m 27 female from Australia. I work as a senior support worker and my work is always busy but I love it. I’m scared that I’m not going to get the promotion I have been working towards because I’ve been having too many days off work. My boss hasn’t said anything to me about it yet but I know he will soon. Sometimes after the weekend I get in that much of a rut that I can’t muster up the motivation to go to work on Monday, and then that turns in to Tuesday, and then sometimes even Wednesday. I use health reasons as my excuse but it’s really because I can’t even imagine going to work when I feel like this. I get so nervous about what my boss will say when I text in sick that I turn my phone off all day. When I’m at work I’m an excellent employee and am well liked, no one would guess that I get so low outside of work. I’ve been self sabotaging by eating junk food, smoking too much weed and not exercising. I feel guilty because I haven’t been taking my dog for walks and she is putting on weight. I  lost 20 kilos and was feeling great, now I’ve thrown all that down the drain and have completely turned my lifestyle around to what it used to be. I’ve recently put on 9 kilos and an feeling disgusted in myself and how I’m treating myself. I haven’t been in a relationship in over 3 years because I can’t imagine being in a relationship with someone. I’m too used to my current lifestyle and don’t like being around people when I get home from work. I also feel like I’m too fat and unattractive for anyone to want me. People tell me that I look fine and I’m being hard on myself but I feel like I’m huge and ugly. Sometimes I feel like I’m trapped in a prison and can’t leave the house. I stay on the lounge and don’t get up all day except for eating and going to the toilet. I’m supposed to be studying but I haven’t even started and it’s already halfway through the course. This makes it the 2nd time I will have failed the course because I’m unmotivated. It’s strange that I am such a good worker and am such a different person at work but I’m so scared of losing my job and the money I’ve gotten used to that I try my best at work but when I get in these moods my performance drops. I’ve been thinking about seeking therapy again but the thought of it is also exhausting.

I am currently suffering depression and have suffered from it multiple times in the past. I've been trying to narrow down why I am depressed as the causes are hard to pinpoint this time. After seeing my phycologist today, I was home alone and I was starting to feel a bit better. As soon as my brother came home from school, followed by my parents, my mood dropped and I felt depressed again. Looking back on the past 3 months since I've gotten depressed, when my family try to assist me, they make me feel even more depressed and I just want to get away from them.
I have such a good relationship with my family and would never want to upset them and vise versa. I am confused why my family make me feel worst when they honestly aren't doing anything wrong to upset me. I will start to feel a bit better when I am home alone but as soon as a family member comes home, I fall back down and into my shell without them even saying a word.
Has anyone else felt this? Could it have something to do with me needing some personal space to work things out?

Hi all,
Until recently I was a high-functioning depressive. I am 20 years old an was studying law at university and working as a paralegal. Unfortunately, because I was ignoring my own wellbeing I worked myself into a really bad state and decided to discontinue work and study. 
When I no longer had work to do I began binge-eating every day. Now I have put on 20kg and feel pretty disgusting about myself. 
At this point I know I would like to try something new. I am interested in finding a part-time job and beginning to study nursing (it's something I have wanted to do since I was admitted to hospital for mental health reasons and the nurses were amazing). The only problem is I have lost all of my self-esteem and feel embarrassed to go in public looking the way I do now. It's really difficult because I want to take the steps to get better but am so down on myself that it's making it very hard. It's especially hard for me because I was recovering from an eating disorder when I began binge eating and it's really provoked a lot of negative thoughts. 
Does anyone have experience in overcoming this kind of situation or any tips on how to deal with this? I really want to move forward with my life, but find myself getting sucked back in to the same old patterns :( 
Thank you :)

Hi all, looking for some help. I'm 4 months into a relationship with somebody and right from the start there have been issues which to this date have yet to be resolved. Apart from these issues, the relationship is great. My partners says they'll work on the issues but minimal effort is given, and its not much is changing at all and the effort is still at a minimum. I keep telling myself to be patient and they'll get better but as a result of these issues im constantly finding myself in a state of sadness and feeling worthless. My self esteem and confidence have taken a major hit and I often feel below rock bottom in life. The easiest way to explain it is that I feel like im in a big black hole and no matter how hard I try to get out, i cant escape. I feel these relationship issues are taking over my life as well as my thoughts, and a lot of the time it completely consumes my thoughts to the point where I struggle to focus on other tasks. Im either really tired or not tired at all and often feel like im not living my life at all. I feel like im just existing and all my energy is going into just surviving the day. I cant shake the feeling that this nightmare will never end and I feel like Ive lost so much of myself and im starting to hate the person im becoming. Im no longer the person I used to be; the person I was proud to be.
I think this may be a case of depression but im not sure. Does anyone have any opinions or any advice on how to cope with all of these overwhelming feelings? It sometimes just feel like they're too much to handle and I dont know what to do anymore. It feels like it'll never end.

My husband has suffered from depression in the past but he had an encounter yesterday that has triggered his depression again. 
He’s an avid trail runner and yesterday while out training he encountered a group of teenagers that tried to attack him and one managed to get a punch in, Lots of blood, massive cut inside his cheek and in quite some pain! 
While I’m so sad this has happened to him I’m struggling to know how to help him. He doesn’t want to talk about it, he may be embarrassed I’m sure. But I need him back, we have 3 small kids and I’m at the end of my rope, I’m parenting in my own here (including him). He’s currently locked himself in our room and just can’t be bothered with anything. 
am I not being compassionate enough?
at what point does he just need to move on with life? 
are there ways for him to cope better? I don’t know if other people would respond in the same way?

Ive been unemployed for about a year now, and have been job searching but cannot seem to get a bite of anything!
So i am a personal trainer but left my job as the rent was too high and wasnt making any money from it, as much as i loved it and it made me happy, i had to stop it.
Since i quit, ive been back in a hole of depression. I got in a new relationship after ending one for 6 years, but i am being mistreated and used yet i cant break away because  all that makes me happy is feeling comfort that i have somebody, even though i know i am being treated poorly. Im to weak to end it because illl feel even more alone. I my friends tell me they are there to talk to but when i tell them im lonely they dont make an effort to help. 
When my parents see me upset they just want me to be on medication and everything will be ok, but medications dont help relationships and finding jobs, and i strongly disagree with it as i was on it for 2 years and made it worse.
So im stuck in a hole, i cant sleep, try to exercise but have no appite so i feel weak in the gym. Ive put on weight because of my relationship which is why i am hesitant to get back into personal training because i hate myself. I feel alone, i feel im not moving forward and im still living at home, all my family pity me and my boyfriend makes me feel like im a lazy idiot. 
Ive lost all confidence in myself and the only time i was happy was personal training, talking to new people everyday, but im stuck at home with no interaction and no money. I do art which is a strong passion of mine, but of course no jobs in that.
Its a recipe for disaster and i have no idea what to do anymore.

Hello Everyone,
I have been suffering from various degrees of depression since my teens and suffering from anxiety & PTSD from previous employment.
I'm currently not working due to poor mental health and I'm currently seeing a Psychologist. I'm taking an antidepressant in the morning and additional at night.
I've moved at of my rental property and moved back home for support.
I'm bankrupt (lost my car) and will suffer the consequence until 2021.
My question is, what are people using to get better? Are they journalling, using any products to help them, using a vision board, going to life coach ????
I'm 28 years old and restarting my life and want to use this time to rise from the ashes.
Thank you

Hi everyone,I would I would start my post, by introducing myself.I am Paul, 36 year old single gay guy, who is a travel broker based in regional NSW.After six months of feeling very low, and not being able to muster up the courage to see my GP, I took the step this morning and saw him.I was a little worried about being judged, but the experience was very much the opposite and I am well and truly on my way to recovery.Some of the things I have experienced these last couple of months have been extreme tiredness despite a good nine hours sleep each night, loneliness, a feeling of complete sadness and helplessness, no motivation to do anything and a loss of interest in things I normally love.I completed a k10 exam on myself, and it indicated I had depression at a high level, so saw gp for a formal assessment.He is sending me for blood tests, and has diagnosed stress and depression. It looks like I might be going on anti depressants for the short term anyway, and will be receiving therapy.I probably suffered for this allot longer than I needed to, due to the stigma and shame that is associated with mental illness, my advice is to everyone, but especially the guys, as we are the ones that are the hardest to get to go and talk to anyone, don't be afraid, GP's are very supportive, and there to help.Would love to hear everyone's stories.

I was wondering how taking pills can fill the emptiness from inside, I have had bipolar most my life, [ Im 55} and lately it is getting worse. I have asked my doctor for help, and he gave me new pills, but when i asked to speak to someone, he said i was not covered for that with government helping. I can see a podiatrist, or dietrician,or physiotherapist. My four children have grown up and left, and i have no real contact with them apart from the looking at their facebooks. They live near their father, who played the injured party throughout our marriage breakdown, and so i am this villain who left them. { I had no choice as hubby then was in navy, and i was booted out when i asked for a divorce]
Anyway, life seems so empty now, as my whole life resolved around my boys. I live on a disability, which has isolated me. My new hubby is my carer, but he has his own issues. trying harder and harder each day to find reasons to live. We have no life savings, no friends, no assets. I find myself trying harder and harder each day trying to find a reason to live. I keep looking for the silver lining at the end of the tunnel, but its only darkness. When i reach out, im condemmed for seeking attention.

For the past month I’ve been too depressed to go to school. Every new week I promise myself I’ll go but I keep putting it off and when I wake up, I get so anxious about it I force myself back to sleep to calm down. I don’t know what to do anymore and I’ve gotten numerous calls from my school asking where I am. I don’t live with my parents anymore and I’ve found that without the pressure of authority it’s hard to get anything done. Does anyone have any tip on how I can overcome this? I need to keep going to school but the thought of it makes me so scared I want to cry, and it feels like there’s a weight in my chest

It is great to find this community as it is hard to talk about this as everyone is so caught up with their 'own stuff' that I feel I can't talk about this.
I have struggled enormously with motherhood.  I was a corporate executive travelling the world and was offered my dream job when I had just had my baby.  I was under the erroneous view that I could be a good mum and keep my career.  Well this I found out was not the case, and due to a lot of pressure to 'be a good mum', I quit my career with the intention of returning.  I really struggled to find myself and hit post natal depression in a big way as I felt a failure on all fronts - I resented my children and my family for the financial struggle and lack of purpose I felt - and then I felt a failure as all the previous career doors seemed to slam shut around me.
I am still underemployed - grabbing low paid work and working in my husband's business - which is not fulfilling me. I also do a lot of 'free' work for the local community, as no one seems to think what I do is worth being paid for (and yes I have asked!).  I can't get interviews as I am either overqualified or other applicants are more attractive.  As this continues, my confidence is dying. As a result I start to wish for this life to be over as it is such a mess.  We have no money for anything fun or that would be fulfilling as every cent goes to keeping the business alive or a roof over our head.  I look at what my potential was and I despair every day that I have been such a complete failure.
My family don't acknowledge depression.  I get no encouragement or help as everyone thinks I am the person 'who had it all' and I 'should be happy'.  Well I'm not and it is affecting my patience with my kids and our relationship.  It is self-indulgent to want to talk about your issues when everyone 'has their thing' so I should get over it, has been the subtle and not-so-subtle message.  
I don't know what to do, and I am worried that the blackness is settling in again and I won't be able to get out this time.  I know the advice will be to see a GP, but taking that step scares the hell out of me for facing it as well as costs involved.  Just getting this out has helped.

I was diagnosed Jan 2017 with dysthymia.  I came out of a severe depression in March 2017 that lasted for 7 months.  Im not sure if the diagnoses is right as I am now in another deep depression that is causing me great pain and anxiety.  Can anyone who has dysthymia please tell me about their episodes so i have something to compare.  I have many episodes over 40 yrs..just discovering this now...but not sure if this has been dysthymia. I am so tired and disappointed as I dont think I can make it through this time

Hi there
After months of tapering and 8 weeks of being SSRI free I have fallen in a hole. Deeper than I could dig myself out od so I am back on medication, I have seen my GP, i have a MHCP and a new psychologist and it looks like I am going to have to quit my job. Its been a.catalyst anyway. I am getting help but I feel like I failed. 
I have a supportive husband and a nice house and I know I am lucky..Just wish I felt worthyof it. And some joy. It would be nice to feel that again. Only 3 days back on meds though. Iknow it takes time. Just wish I was strong enough to not have to quit my job. I just feel so crappy and scared when I am there and I have to sneak into the toilets to cry. I dont trust  anyone there enough to talk it through. Everyone knows everyone, HR, management and I think they will be happy to see the back of me because of all the time I take off for anxiety, migraines and depression. Thanks for listening.
Scout

Over the past couple of months I’ve been in a really dark space. Like many others ... I blessed with a loving family, material satisfaction and my physical health... but deep down I’m curling up and slowly dying. I find no joy in anything and life feels contrived. I’ve developed immense anxiety over work and having to deal with criticism...I get anxious every morning for going to work.
whilst on the outside everything seems okay ... deep inside I’m really struggling. My wife knows and she’s really supportive. I feel sorry that I can’t be the man she needs as her health isn’t that good. She’s much more stoic than I am. 
I don’t know what to do and how open to be with my employer...who I’m just contracting with. 
i feel low and then say to my self “get a grip of yourself and get on with life”
i cried this morning and sitting on the train now i could burst out with a deep sense of despair ... I really don’t know how to deal with this now and long term ... I’m scared

I've been on and off this site that many times.Scared and nervous about what to say, here goes. There are times when I feel happy, but there is an enormous amount of times that I just don't feel right.  I can't concentrate on things, feel restless a lot of the  time, burst into tears at the slightest, and not know why.  I think not knowing why I have these feelings is the thing that worries me the most.  Which just makes me feel even worse.  Sometimes when I have been sitting with friends, everyone is laughing and having a good time.  I get the feeling of isolation.  I then  put on a front that I'm enjoying what is going on.  It's like looking from the outside in and it is not you.  It's like being on a roller coaster.  I can exude confidence really well and hide the way I feel, but inside my stomach in churning.  My father died back in 1995 and I have just neverI really felt the same. Here I am yet again looking for reasons/excuses for the way I feel.  I'm unsure of myself nearly all the time. I go through mood changes where I get this strong ""not a problem"" ""whats the worst that can happen"" attitude, a sort of high, then I go downhill fast and the wave of uncertainty comes back full on. I more times than not have a feeling of unsettled nerves. Small things that most people seem to just handle, set me off, making me so stressed that I cant eat, sleep and break out into cold sweats.   I'm scared for some reason of going to a GP, fear of what to say.  Any advise or help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi everyone, over the years I’ve struggled with a lot of stuff and my main issues come from trying different meds for anxiety and depression, I wake up every morning thinking what’s the point of even getting up, or when I do get up to go somewhere I have a anxiety attack while driving and unfortunately nothing that the gp has prescribed me works, oh just up your dose he says, I don’t think taking heaps of benzodiazepines is the best idea whilst driving, I’m tired ALL the time even when I think I’ve had a good sleep I’m still tired all day, I’m trying to get back on my feet and find a job so I can give my wife and myself the life we deserve but it feels like everything I do is against me, and as I’m writing this out I’ve got tears streaming down my face for no reason
hopefully someone can help me
cause I’m seriously over it
Paul

Hey there. I'm 37 and was misdiagnosed in my early 20s with clinical depression. 4 weeks ago i was diagnosed with bipolar 2. Oh it makes so much sense now.
So apart from coming to terms with this new diagnosis (and wondering huh, bipolar 2 what's that? there is more than one?) I am also dealing with the physical symptoms and feelings of taking mood stabilisers and would love some feedback from other bipolar 2 recently diagnosed people about their initial experiences on mood stabilisers.
 Here's 10 questions/comments/issues I'm going through:
 1.) Am sleeping the best I have had for years. Insomnia at bay for now. Wow. Can this last? 
2.) But sooo exhausted during the day. Just feel tired all the time now. What's with that? Is my body catching up on years of crappy sleep?!
2.) Am more grumpy and intolerant than normal and surprised by this.
3.) missing my highs already feel like something's gone (well it's there but just a shadow). Will that ever come back?
4.) Still able to feel sad (bawled my eyes out over sad tv last night). But no despair.
5.) Not much appetite at all.
6.) feel really slow but people around me say I'm not so is it my own perception?
7.) things are more deliberate and thought out which is totally spinning me out. Will I still be spontaneous?
8.) it feels like an actual physical barrier is stopping me from falling into that dark pit of nothing. Very interesting.
9.) For the first time in years I don't feel hollow.
10.) people are wondering if I'm ok because I'm not my bubbly, effervescent, over the top self - will my personality catch up once the meds settle in?
I am going through all of this with my psychiatrist so I'm not asking for medical advice. But I know no one with this disorder and would love to hear about others' experiences when first diagnosed and on medication. Or guide me to where I can find out more? 
Cheers

I am a new mother, my baby is at 12 weeks now and I don’t have any problem looking after her. I really love my daughter. But since I had my baby I keep on crying and thinking of negative things like hatred and sadness. Even if there’s no reason. Because it all started with this.
I am with my mother-in-law and I do not want to trust my daughter with her care. It is because when my baby was born she was putting powder and using alcohol on my newborns skin which is for me whats the point??? ALCOHOL??? Is my baby infectious for her to sanitise my baby??? 
Her reason is for my baby to have a good smell. And I am like HUHHHHHH???? Even if you dont put anything on baby they still smells good because they are baby. They don’t sweat! Now seems like I am very protective mother because I started to get paranoid everytime she’s looking after my bub. What I want should be followed, the way how I care. But if my in-law doesn’t follow what I said i feel like a bomb that will explode, however I dont show it infront of her, I will tell my husband to let her know. But that issue keeps on going and if it doesn’t solve I just cried and argue with my husband. I feel that my husband is on her mothers side and having this feeling I don’t want to see or talk to her mother all the time, and thats what she was doing as well she stays in her room all the time, even ask my husband to cook for her eat her dinner inside her bedroom which makes me angry because we are raised by our parents that every meal time we must have it in the dining. I even hate what she’s doing because my husband just came from work and she still wait for him to cook for her. Sometimes I just even ignore her even if I heared what she said because I really hate her since I had my baby. For me she is like the evil mother-in-law trying to be perfect. I don’t know what psychological issue I am having right now.

I'm 38 years old and have been receiving treatment for depression for the last 9 months. I saw a psychiatrist due to overwhelming feelings of sadness I'd been having recently. This was coupled with uncontrollable anger and frustration I'd been having for some time dealing with my children. 

In the last 5-6 months, I've been investigating the possibility that I have ADHD. I raised it with my psychiatrist who said he could screen me for it but that we would need to resolve my depression first before treating me for ADHD. I no longer feel ""depressed"" as such but quite flat and still have trouble controlling my anger and mood. The screening test I took says that there are traits strongly aligned with ADHD.
What are other peoples' experiences? Have you been medicated for both ADHD and depression at the same time or only had your ADHD treated once the depression was resolved?

I've got no money, no job, no real friends who i can talk to about anything more serious than TV shows, am 31 living with my parents, no car, disfiguring psoriasis and a back problem that makes it impossible to stand or sit for anything longer an hour or two. I definitely have the problem of not being able to recall having felt positive about anything in years. All my friends have settled down and got married so i never see anyone anymore and I'm bored and lonely. I'm not suicidal, but i think that's only because i know what it would do to my mum.
I've tried to get professional help, but with no money i've just been run around the public system from incompetent to no english (or both) until I'd used all my free sessions and haven't even been diagnosed yet. Well i was once, but he was one of the incompetents. He was so computer illiterate he typed with only his index fingers at around 5 words a minute. He spent most of the session typing (that slowly) what i was saying into a translator, because he couldn't understand any of the words over 3 syllables i was using (I'm a uni graduate and tend to articulate using precise language), said i was definitely suffering from depression and then totally failed to save any of the documentation onto my medical records. I found this out because he told me to go back and see my GP about seeing a specialist as it wouldn't be covered if it wasn't the GP that wrote the recommendation. The GP told me i have to see a psychiatrist and be assessed first before he could make that kind of recommendation and was extremely unhelpful when i explained that the psychiatrist had sent me to him. I think he thought i was just trying to get drugs. And that was the best of all the free psychologists and psychiatrists i was able to see.
 I've been unemployed for ages and have no references i have been able to make contact with. I cant work in any form of customer service because having to deal with strangers all the time drives me crazy enough that i would rather make myself sick than go to work (i eat off food, or have nothing but dairy for days so that i get ill. I don't know if that counts as self harm, but if it does then i do that rather than deal with people constantly). And even non-customer service jobs where i have to talk to colleagues all the time makes me feel this way too (social anxiety/introversion?).
 I don't know what to do to stop feeling so helpless. I can't even see the same GP twice in a row cos i dont have a family doctor or anything like that, just a centre where there are doctors and the first one free sees you and they never want to deal with anything more complex than a sick certificate. they wont do anything about my back except recommend a physio at $65 a session which i cant afford. My psoriasis is slowly taking over my face so nobody who doesn't already know me wants to talk to me so i cant meet anyone new. My parents are the sort of people who think mental illness is an excuse to be slack or to take drugs and tell me at least once a week that I'm slack or useless cos i cant find work.
 I truly feel like I've been backed into a corner from every direction at once. I've tried to deal with things one at a time, but life just wont let me as the other problems demand attention before i can make any headway and i just end up feeling smothered again. Please tell me how i can help myself?

Hi,
I been going through acute depression and have schizoaffective disorder. I also have polio that hinders the way I can do things like walking, carrying. I'm going through a tough time with my depression and finding it hard to find a way out. I can't find work because I have been out of work for 3 years, I am trying to make my way back to the work force but having no luck at all. I use to be a web developer but I have been out of that industry for quite sometime now so all work associated with web development turns me down. I also have been hospitalised in a mental health hospital for 3 months. I get lost when I try to speak and can't find words to express myself. I don't know what to do any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hello BB community, it's amazing to see how much support is here.
I have posted here in the past but have returned to gain some advice in regards to my situation. I have been told I have GAD and Depression, but I do not identify with this. I recently relocated interstate to be near family after living in Melbourne for 9 years. I gained 3 qualifications while I was living in Melbourne and have been unemployed for the past year or more. I was having a terribly hard time trying to find work within the Disability sector, as I love to help people. But I was also feeling anxious and depressed as I wasn't getting ahead. My most recent job lasted two shifts as my Supervisor was very unprofessional with his communication and I was not supported there as a new staff member. He wasn't allocating me hours either.
I was also on medication the last 7 months for the second time as my acne condition was severe again and I couldn't look in the mirror. This was greatly effecting my mental health and I needed to come home to heal. I was really broke and couldn't afford to live and pay rent in Melbourne and I had the opportunity to live with my family (in my mums caravan) which I am grateful for but it's not where I want to be. I have been on my own since my last relationship ended Sept 2017, and I know I need to work on my independence. I have been challenging myself daily to go and do things on my own that I find difficult but it seems to be getting harder to do. Sometimes just going to the shops for food is almost impossible. I am seeking out a new psychologist but I am a bit put off from the last 2 I had as they made me feel worse. I also don't know anyone where I have moved to and am feeling very isolated from friends.
I know now is my time to do some self-discovery but I feel so weak and shy all the time. I do not want to go on medication either as I have tried that and prefer natural medicine. I think I just need someone to talk to as I am in limbo at the moment physically and mentally. I can't decide where I want to live. Near my friends in Melbourne or near my family. I am torn. May I ask what you have done when feeling lost in life and unsure of what path to take? especially being unemployed, I have had no help whatsoever from the job providers and am getting really impatient.
Any advice would be muchly appreciated. :)

Well a little about myself, im 33 years of age, male and live alone. I never really dealt with depression until a few years ago; well i did but nothing on this scale. Most the time before it was a once every now and then occurrence that i could snap out of within the day or so. Issues i have now is there is no one left in my life, but thats just the start of it. 
See i used to smoke marijuana for many years and all was good, the only paranoia i developed was from trying to hide it from family (they are all against it and is the reason i stopped). The constant pressure of feeling like if they find out and would be disbanded from the family payed a toll, well it's happened without it anyway...
My depression came on months to a year after quitting my full time marijuana use, i have smoked the odd few times after and it seems to make me feel better yet guilty about what my family thinks so i never continue. I have also been put on and off anti depressants over the past few years (non marijuana use) yet i always get really bad side effects so i work my way back off them. They never seem to help much at all, and make me wonder what they actually put in those medications we're blindly putting in our system.
What i don't understand is Marijuana works for me, however it's obviously frowned apon by the public, my family and employers. Employers and family don't mind if i take anti depressents that cause more issues and horrific side effects, yet if i smoked weed the world is going to end. Which also leads to unemployment, fear of judgement and a sense of unworthiness. Im currently unemployed and struggling like never before with no assistance from anyone, im scared to end up homeless. I have bills and everyone asking for money yet never able to even get a job interview (obviously causing major depression). I have also done counseling last time i was on anti depressants, they all tend to say nothing is wrong with me and it's just lack of a job causing this.
I only know one thing that works yet it leaves me feeling ashamed (not that it really matters anymore) but yeah. Well as i have no one to talk to anymore and running out of options i have decided to sign up. I still feel very doubtful that this will help but i have nothing to lose i guess.. PS i have also thought of moving to a country that have medicinal cannabis programs that also treat depression. I really don't like anti depressants, they are horrible

Hi, 
So this is my first time writing on here and i'm just feeling unsure about how i'm feeling and what to do. For many years i've suffered with depression and anxiety. In the past few months its gotten worse and I don't know what to do. I've tried medication but that never helped it just made me feel numb inside. My mental health doesn't just effect me but others around me and I take my anger out of my partner and family when I don't mean to.
Can anyone give me any tips with what to do before it gets any worse. Also, does anyone recommend self administration into a psych/hospital?
thankyou, S.

Before I start, I don’t want to be refered anywhere. I want someone to listen. I have no one to talk to. I just want to talk. 
I had my second baby 10 weeks ago. I feel connected to him. But, I can’t help but feel constantly guilty for my first born. I constantly feel like I’m failing him, not playing with him enough, not giving him enough. When I put more time aside to do things with him, I feel like I’m failing my second born. I honestly feel like I can’t juggle them. Who ever is getting the attention at the time, I feel like it’s not right. I feel like my other kid is then feeling neglected. 
I have other things to say but I don’t want to discuss here. I’m affraid people I know might find out I’m feeling this way and I don’t want that. I feel alone and I don’t want people to suddenly care temporarily. Thanks.

So I'v made some really awesome recovery after a very acute episode of depression; after three weeks on the medication my appetite returned and I was feeling human again and after a month I was working full time again and keeping very busy and active (but to be honest I was still in shock from what I had experienced). 

Anyways, past week I've noticed the depression crawling back. I've been on the AD's for two and a half months--this week was significant enough that I've taken my first day off work (my boss knows about my bad brain and is very understanding) Sleep is interrupted and I feel like I'm slipping back into destructive thought patterns (existential rumination coming back). It's been three days maybe like this. I've booked into to see a GP but my GP is overseas and he has worked very closely with me over the past three months. So it's really shitty that I have to see someone new. 

I'm not sure what I am asking but is it common for an AD to work then stop working within the first three months? Oh should I just wait this one out?

Hi all,
I wanted to post a little bit about my story. After battling debilitating daily panic attacks,derealisation, depersonalisation, generalised anxiety and major depression for a year now, i can say that i am on the road to recovery! I was in such a horrible dark place with what seemed like an eternity. I had completely lost myself. I cant even describe in words how i felt and it scares me to even think about it. I would have periods where I couldn't leave the house for weeks, I had to quit my permanent job that I had for years, i would have to excuse myself mid conversation to go to the bathroom and have an unprovoked panic attack (on days that I could even get words out of my mouth), some days i couldnt even get out of bed for days, paralysed with darkness, dread and agonising fear, even to get some water. I would wait till my partner got home late afternoon so they could get me a glass of water. For almost a year, I couldn't even find momentary relief. I truly felt like I had lost myself and thought I would honestly exist like this forever. Every bit of me truly believed this. 
Well I am happy to say that i was wrong. For anybody that is in a dark place, please hang in there. It does get better. I will say this again, recovery is very possible. It does get better. I know it may feel like these words almost feel like lies, or impossible or unrelateable (i felt like this when I was bad) but hang in there, you can recover :) 
Do not underestimate the little things. Eating well, sleeping well, getting out of the house, exercise, relaxation techniques, having a recovery plan or anxiety/depression plan, seeking inspiration, reaching out for help, seeing a psychologist and one of the most important, giving yourself time and grace on those days where you feel like you're going to be stuck like this forever. Try not to be hard on yourself. Recovery is not linear and it can be different for everybody. I do however believe that there are some universal things that are beneficial to everyone's recovery. For e.g. eating well. Taking a good quality multi vit, eating foods high in omega 3, aminos such as tyrosine (speak togp for interactions) which help absorb more dopamine, serotonin etc. 
Unfortunately I have to keep this short but I just wanted to share that I am feeling better, and if I can you definitely can! 
Hang in there, you are valued you are important you are loved :) 
<3

About three years ago I went to my gp and obtained a mental health plan that outlined my symptoms, treatment (6 referred sessions of counselling with a psychologist at headspace) and at the very bottom it said diagnosis: GAD, depression, panic attacks. Then, when I saw my psychologist she said ""we already know you have depression so we won't go through a diagnosis again"". I then saw two other psychologists who did not require a mental health plan from a different service as I was having trouble finding someone who I clicked with. Neither of these mentioned my diagnosis. A month ago I decided to go back to headspace so I saw my gp again and I obtained the same plan with the same diagnosis of GAD, depression and panic attacks. However, my new psychologist has not yet mentioned a diagnosis process to formalise this. So, I want to know, do I have depression and GAD due to the diagnosis made by my gp, or do I have to push for a formal diagnosis from headspace? It has never been made clear to me what is wrong with me. I just feel as though my feelings and headspace isn't valid enough to be treated by a mental health professional and a diagnosis would make me feel more comfortable as I would know that I'm not just overreacting or being overly sensitive, there is actually a reason I think and feel the way I do. I have struggled since I was a young child, maybe around 10, and it is now reaching the point where I feel like life in unbearable - surely this is not ""normal"". Any help would be appreciated :)

Hey,
I recently started university & I really want to do well on what I'm doing, yet I feel demotivated most of the times. There are also times when I think about how I could get away from all the stress and pressure if I disappear, like I could run away. (Would never act on it, just thoughts). I get anxious when I'm thinking about failing. I did the ""Are you depressed"" test on the website & it said that I am. But idk isn't it normal to be demotivated sometimes & want to distance yourself from everyone and just want to stay in your bed""? Not wanting to get up?
:)

Hi all,
I have only just joined here as a first step in trying to figure out what i need to do. i started a new job almost a year to the day ago and in the last 6-8 months i just cannot seem to do what i should do. all other aspects of my life seem to be great, awesome wife, i'm active ahve friends etc, however when it comes to sunday night and knowing the work week is about the start i just start feeling nervous and my work days are so unproductive, i estimate maybe doing 30% of what i should in a week. I have this non stop feeling in my stomach and i really know i need to do more but when it comes down to it i just sit in front of my computer screen until i get distracted and end up doing not much at all. I feel it wont be too long until my sales are not where they need to be and i will be fired but i just can not seem to kickstart and do what i need to.
 
i dont even know if this is depression or what.
 
has anyone else out there been in a similar situation?
 
many thanks

Hi, 
This is my first time here. Not yet sure what I am hoping to get out of this, but I feel a lighter chest is a satisfactory achievement, if nothing else. I am a 23yo female. Externally, my life is more than I could have ever envisioned.  I have my dream job as a Registered Nurse. I work with an amazing team. I enjoy every moment I'm at work, even the tough moments. Out of work I have a strong friendship group. I enjoy every moment that I am with my friends no matter how basic our day is spent. However, at the end of the day when I go home and when I get time to stop - I feel myself just fall into a black pit. I'm distracted and preoccupied with my thoughts. I feel anxious and on edge, and this causes tension at home. In a word, I feel depressed. Everyday I try to fill my day so that I am busy. It's hard because no-one sees the pain I am in once everything is striped away. I don't know where these feelings are coming from and don't know who I can share them with. There is nothing in my life that I would change. I am happy, but I am also trapped by a weight that I can barely explain. Hard to justify this feeling to myself, let along others. Is it still depression if I still find pleasure in daily life? How can I be still again and  be content?

Hi all,
This is my first time writing here because I desperately need help. Our household is under big financial problem and I will be trapped in this situation for another 1 or 2 years, and I have been very depressed for the last 6 months and so, feeling helpless and trapped. 
I have been trying to share stories with my mother, but it apparently stressed her up and made her avoiding me because she doesn't want to get depressed as well. Then, I tried to share stories with my brother and sister in law, but the reaction was the same. They think I am a difficult person, have always been negative and give them burdens by asking them to listen. Now both sides of my family are avoiding me. This action made me feel so rejected and helpless, since the closest people to me seems ignoring me.
I don't understand why my families rejected me in such a time like this, feels like I am a bag of smelly rubbish and have to be avoided at all costs. I need to talk to someone close to me, but noone wants to listen.
I hope someone out there can help, what should I do to overcome this rejection feeling now, while coping with depression at the same time?
Thank you so much for your time, whoever read this post.... I will really appreciate it.

Somethings about me, I am the foreigner which live in aus. I  feel getting worse of my depression. (High Score of the test)
This is my story:
Our 1st baby came on December, and my mother in law was came to help us. We had told her please help us for a meal & some house work. On the 1st week, everything goes fine. Me & my wife surely couldn’t have much sleep or no sleep. When we back to home, everything was changed, my in-law doesn’t help us much, she just cooked a meal for my wife, and I need to cook my meal by myself, that’s fine , I can eat everything or just have a takeaway food.since I back to work , working from 6am to 7 pm, and I back to home, my wife doesn’t have any dinner , I need to cook for us. After dinner settle baby, leak of sleep. This is our 1 st one , I was committed with my wife I always give her a help, so when she woke up, I woke up also. My in law just laying on the floor, and watching tv. Whatever I do with the baby , my in law always blame me , said this’s wrong, that’s wrong, You shouldn’t do that. I am a new dad, I learned from internet&some course, I am fresh, I am trying. Finally we pay$1000 to send her back to home. I knew my wife had a depression too, so we went to GP, and went to the Psychologist. I took an other week off to help her to recover, finally she is fine now.
I found I had a depression on March, I try to speak to my friends, they just said,”it’s normal , it will pass” I read a lot of article , I known nothing is 100%good, just need good enough. I do sports twice a week, I can handle my baby ok.
but in this week, every word from my in law she was blamed me suddenly come back to my mind. When my baby crying,I couldn’t settle her. Feel like she don’t want me anymore.I am feeling I am worthless, useless, I am feeling upset, helpless. I would like to tell someone but no one can help. I don’t think the Psychologist can help me, because I think most of them are forcing on women postpartum depression. Everyone asked me how’s my baby, how’s my wife, my no one care about daddy’s also have a postpartum depression.
I don’t know where I can get some help specially for the daddy’s postpartum depression? I need some help I need some advice,  I wondering if I can get help here? 
 
It’s a long story, I hope someone can understand and 
Hopefully my English wasn’t too bad
 
thanks

I've spent the last few days reading through a lot of old threads on this site (and purposely not commenting on them) and I've noticed something curious that I recall previously noticing in numerous group therapy sessions many years ago.

So many people here are talking about feeling constantly anxious about everything and having seemingly regular uncontrollable panic attacks (especially in public places or unfamiliar circumstances). It seems ridiculously common among those that consider themselves depressed.

While I can rationally understand why people can get anxious about certain things... this is still something that I can't relate to. I've got all the ""sad"" feelings, they dominate my thoughts days and nights, most days I consider whether ""seeing tomorrow"" is really worth the effort at all. Without trying to sound pretentious... to date, after more than 20 years I have not met anyone who looks as deeply into the dark as I do... in physical group sessions my perspectives always freaked people out to the point that the suicidal people would ask me during breaks ""how do you possibly survive""?

However, I have zero anxiety about anything. Nothing ever really makes me feel ""nervous"", I certainly don't have panic attacks... but this appears to be extremely rare for some reason. If fact, in all of the hundreds of comments I've read through over the last 2 days (many going back several years) I've yet to find a comment about this.

I've been trying to work out why this is, what makes me different. The only thing I've come up with so far is that the only opinions of people that I hold in high regard are from people who I respect... which is something that has to be earned with me. While the opinions of people that I don't have respect for (or have yet to earn that respect)... while sometimes interesting, don't really matter to me that much. Certainly not to the point that I obsess about it.

Hi, I’m 15 and over the past six months I’ve been extremely tired, depressed, lonley, lost and I can’t concentrate on anything every day. Over the past two to three years I’ve struggled with anxiety but I never saw a professional. Although it’s been hard to understand I think I might have depression. Yesterday I did the hardest think I’ve ever done. Talked to my parents about it. Although we didn’t talk about everything (more specifically I avoided my depressive thoughts) it for me, very difficult.I spoke to my dad and he talked about how when he was a teenager he felt the same as I do. He said that it’s just teenage hormones and everyone goes though it but I can’t ignore the fact that I feel like it’s more than that. So my question is how do I know the difference? Between average teenage hormones and depression?

I'm going through a really tough time at the moment. I'm literally hating everything about myself and my life. I've had some stresses in my personal life in addition to normal work stress which seemed to be a breaking point for me. I am unable to take time off work but I am in tears at the drop of a hat and have offended and ostracised a number of my colleagues, and can't stop crying when I'm at home. I've put on a lot of weight due to injury. I just got myself back to the gym when I injured myself again. I tried to make an appointment to see my doctor, or any doctor in the surgery but got told that there were no appointments for 2 weeks. I tried calling a family member, but that has simply made things worse. I just feel absolutely, and positively hopeless and nothing I've tried is making it better. I seem to be all up in my head and I can't turn off my thoughts. I live alone so being at home is the worst thing for me, but because I'm so upset, I'm not motivated enough to go anywhere or do anything. I'm spending as much time at work as I can but it's stressful, and not a particularly great place to be. I tried talking to a friend about it last night but she laughed at me and told me I probably just needed a good stiff drink - hence the reason for calling the doctor, but as you can see, that didn't really help either. I'm not at risk of hurting myself but am really apprehensive now that it's the weekend and I'm going to be home alone, in tears all weekend. I know that when you are feeling like this, that you should seek help. I know that the doctor's surgery didn't know how I was feeling, but it just felt like even my doctor doesn't have time for me.

We're here to learn, sure of it. Have to for survival.
Like so many have lived in hell a mammoth amount of times.
I firmly believe collectively we can in majority of cases get on top of depression. We have to, too many die & suffer in unimaginable pain. It's wrong.
 We're intelligent, capaple of thought. It has & CAN be done including coming back from the bottom. 
A psychiatrist said to me when I said I'm going to beat it..."" It can't be done"".
I say maybe it hasn't been, but that doesn't mean it can't!
I'm Bipolar type 1 & 2 (now moreso) & yes its taken yrs but condensed not so long, so far (details later) have achieved pulling the extreme type 1 manias down to more controlled type 2 & anyone that experiences or knows the euphoria & complete unadulterated bliss, NO BODY on this Earth wouldnt want it. Its what people take drugs for, Pure happiness/confidence the list goes on ... 
Point being, mammoth to let it go but achieved reduction, still amazing though.
I like thinking, am DETERMINED to get this crap, worse scenario under   complete control which'd be a WIN!
In shorter time frame thanks to mania that opens or wakes the brain starting to make huge headway breaking through extremely deep depression.
I'm more than a rapid cycler (4 or more a year) I have 8-10 major cycles a year. Gotta get on top else it'll take me too
BP has by far more suicide than any other mental illness I recently read.
 4 attempts in teens, contemplated a few & until recently it was an option. 
Learning Emotional control
Our brains are possibly the least understood organ but what we do know is they're VERY POWERFUL. If we can understand depression from understanding we can learn. Growth.
Believing creates hope & determination
Sincerely sorry for your pain people. 
We can get this

We have had a lot of fun,  but things have started falling apart. My mood has dropped a lot and it has become very hard to remain dominant when all I want to do is sleep. 
The fight we had was insignificant  ... He said something insensitive about my sexuality and it suddenly spiralled. Now we are only texting each other tersely when normally we would meet twice a week. 
What I am wondering about is whether depression brought on by relationship trouble is the same as clinical depression? Will it be long-lasting? Should I try to ""make things better""or let the relationship go so I can concentrate on improving my own mental health?  It's hard to know whether having his company is important. He's very understanding of my psych.  needs as his mother has been unwell, but in other ways he is an ocker type who is not used to offering emotional support. 
Any thoughts about this?  Thank you.

Just checking in. I've been doing pretty well for the last few weeks - don't know if it's because of the medication or just the cycle, but I'm happy to have the rest.
But the last couple days, particularly today, has been rough. Pretty mild, as things go, and I am grateful for that, but I'm feeling really guilty, like I've failed somehow. Like, I was doing so much better, but then I go and slide back down, throwing away the progress I'd made. I know that's not what's happening, I know it's not rational because it's not like I'm choosing to feel like this, or that I've slacked off on my self-care or anything. If anything I'm better equipped to handle these moods then I have been in the past, partially due to my hard work, and mostly due to the hard work of my psychologist (with an uncertain proportion due to the psychiatrist and medication).
I'm just feeling so alone. That I've done all this hard work, putting myself out there, talking to people, engaging with them, but I still go to bed and wake up alone every day. That unless I keep this work going, most people wouldn't notice if I dropped off the face of the earth for days at least.
I know this is just my jerk!brain talking. I know it's not real. But it feels real. And I'm having to actively fight to remember that it's not real.
Damn it, I was doing so well.

I graduated uni in June 2017 after a final 6 week internship at the end of my degree. I struggled to get through the internship as my mentor and I did not mesh so well and I felt anything but positive vibes from her. I constantly felt like I wasn't doing a good job despite getting a good report from her. All my previous pracs in my degree I received nothing but high praise from all mentors. 
Anyway once I finished my degree a full time position had opened up at my current employment which I took. (For reference I studied a bachelor of primary  education and I was working at a before and after school care as an assistant). I took on the coordinator position at the before and after school care. I was comfortable here and I knew exactly what I was doing. For a while I used the excuse that I was taking a gap year for myself before I went into full time teaching but the reality was the thought of teaching and getting a graduate job made me physically sick. All i could think about was how I'm not very good and I'm going to be a horrible teacher who has no idea what to do so what is the point.
a year later and I'm still trying to cope with my anxiety around teaching and I'm also considering if maybe I should choose and different job all together. However recently my work lost the tender at the school where we run our after school care, meaning a new company will come in and take over and we are all loosing our positions. This is stressful in itself. The new company has encourage us all to apply for positions but has told us we will still need to go through the full interview process. This is very upsetting because I feel like I have to interview to keep my job and I'm worried that other people applying will get it over me because they probably have more experience in the position then i do. My anxiety has been through the roof just dealing with this alone I can't sleep and I've been calling in sick to work because I can't bring myself to go knowing I might not be there anymore at all. 
A part of me is saying go and use your degree and get a job as a teacher but again the thought makes me sick and I already know I'm no good anyway. Then this thought makes me feel like such an idiot I wasted my time at uni to study a degree im going to do nothing with. This disapointment I have in myself hurts so much I just don't see the point in anything. I feel like I've let everyone in my life down and like I'm going to go no where so why even bother continuing.

Hi there, 
i suffer from generalised anxiety disorder as well as mild depression. Recently I have found myself saying no to any suggestions that is thrown at me and I want to find strategies to stop that, because it is hurting loves ones I cherish. 
A lot has happened in my life from upset and broken families, to an unhappy job, grief, worrying about friends, finances many things. 
I just want some help from people that have maybe been where I’m at and have seen the lifhr through the darkness. I want to be a happy and stronger me, not pushing away people that are trying to help. 
Anything is greatly appreciated.

I have often wondered what I would be like as a person, who I would become... if the ""darkness"" was completely removed from me. If one day it just vanished, what exactly would be left?

Since I have lived with it so long. It has resulted in many aspects of my personality, not all of which are negative things... in fact some of them are the best characteristics of my character.

For example, my time spent alone thinking and introspectively searching has resulted in a great understanding of myself, how and why I think the way I do and my beliefs. It has also given me a powerful connection and understanding of my emotions (to a degree that not only men, but most women I have met cannot reach). 

I am highly empathetic to the suffering of others and driven to help when I can. I am able to view things easily from other peoples perspectives. I am consciously aware of many problems that people around the world are dealing with and driven to understand and find solutions or ways I can actively not contribute to them getting worse. It has driven things such as the types of organisations I have volunteered for in the past.

It can also be argued that it has likely increased my intelligence, made me more articulate and able to communicate my thoughts and emotions with others much more easily. Also it has given me a deep understanding of many issues happening at the moment that the majority of ""normal"" people are ignorant of because they are too afraid to look into ""the dark"".

People in my life have learned without question that when things get bad, the worse they become... that I am the person to come to for help and as a consequence I have helped many of the people I care about through some of the most difficult moments of their lives. Sometimes they talk to me because I am literally the only person they know that could possibly understand how they feel and what they are going through.

They also consider me more moral, more honest and more capable of giving opinions without biasm than the other people in their lives. They seem to respect my point of view because I try to be as ""realistic"" as possible.

Hi all, 
I feel I am becoming more depressed atm from not working, yet my energy & moods levels are too inconsistent to seek a new job and also look after my children. I quit my professional job early last year during mania (unknown to me what it was at the time). So I find myself nearly 43 with 2 kids and medications not working/tolerable and I haven't been able to get back to where I was 18 months ago, before this severe mania swept everything from under me (& the following depression). I honestly don't know if I have the energy & strength to find another job/career/life, I've had to pick myself up before and this time feels so hard. I know I'll get through this as I've been depressed before, but I still feel like a shell of myself when I'm not low. I've lost my self-confidence. I feel like I've lost my capacity to use my intelligence. I'm trying to study again to be proactive and at least try to make future head roads into something but I honestly just want to be a recluse and buy a block in the bush somewhere and disappear. Stigma is really harsh too, lack of followup/care from my previous workplace (although it was in the health education industry?!). Probably the hardest thing though, has been my family, they've been too scared to talk about it, only my mum has tried. If I had had breast cancer or something, I'm sure they would have tried talking or being there, but nothing really. It's really confused me, I didn't expect it from my family and it's really affected my will, my worthiness or lack of. It's been the hardest factor actually. Presently, I don't want to trek to the countryside to see my parents/family, I just feel too forgotten to try. I feel like well, if you didn't try to understand or help last year, in what was one of the hardest year of my life, you missed out on getting to know me & you can't know me at all now, I feel like I've pulled away from them all, indefinitely. I know that's not healthy long term but I just don't want to go and 'hang out' with them if they don't get me or want to try. I feel so distant from family love after this last 18 months, it's not something I needed on top of the mental instability and I didn't expect it. They're a loving family but they just aren't great emotional talkers or good with mental health it seems.
Thanks for listening x

Hi all, 
Firstly, its nice to be back here on the Online Forums.  As soon as I logged in, I felt supported.  
It's a bit of a long story, but I'll try and shorted it for you. 
For the past two years, I lived in another country.  I'm now back in my home town.  I moved overseas for work, and while it was good at the beginning, it turned out to be a toxic workplace with bullying bosses and colleagues.  I slipped into a huge depression when I was over there, to the point that I took 6 months off to travel and clear my head.  Now I'm back in my home town, the job search is on and it's getting to me.  I worked in a very particular field, where people get very emotionally-charged with every meeting, and I'm facing a situation where people are asking me when I'm returning to 'The Dream Job.'  To me, it was very shiny from the outside, but once you get into it, its a lot of hard, dirty work with a lot of competition and difficult people.  I've returned to my home town where it seems that my network has shrunk considerably.  I have a boyfriend here who is amazing, but he's new to this city so as a result, doesn't have any networks here either.  I'm feeling friendless and I'm sleeping a lot (which is a big sign for me).  
It seems like a bit of rambling, but I guess I'm looking for a bit of a helping hand so I can get to the next stage without falling into a depression again.  I can feel one lingering around, but so far it has only been patches of a few hours that are bad, and they're no where near as bad as last year's days.  
Any strategies out there for moving to a new place?  I'm not a very good socialiser as it is, so 'going and making friends' is not really possible for me.  Happy to hear any words of positivity and/or suggestions and/or support. 
Wild.

My mental health has been declining steadily for a few months. Ive never felt like this before in my life. I was prescribed medication but it made me so ill. Its like I'm not here at all, I've just disappeared and no one even noticed. Its strange. I get a long ok, and then i have a massive meltdown and cry for hours and just want anyone to help me but no one is ever around. When ever I see the psych I'm having a good day, as I can never get in when I'm having a bad day.
No one ever sees my bad days and it makes me feel like I'm making it up.
Does this happen to anyone else?

I've been struggling with depression for 5 years. Almost two years ago I had a major breakdown which ended in a hospitalization. Since then my parents have kept tabs on me. Particularly my mum. 
I went to therapy for a while as per the hospitals recommendation and the wishes of my parents. 
My issue is that both my parents and my therapist are always asking what I'm thinking or if I'm ok. Or they're asking if there is anything that I want to talk about. I know that they're being supportive but it stresses me out.  How am I supposed to explain my mind to people if I can't even make sense of it myself?
It's become easier to pretend I'm ok to stop the questions. As a result my therapist has suggested we stop appointments and my parents haven't been asking questions as much. 
I know that I want and need help because everything is too much. But I can't verbalise anything. I'm noticing that my behaviour and thoughts are in the same place as before my breakdown but as last time I'm too nervous to seek help. I feel like because I can't explain my thoughts and emotions clearly that they won't understand. 
Any advice or help on how to explain your head to others when you can barely make sense of it yourself.?

Hi all,
I'm on to my fourth antidepressant, first three were ssri now an snri.
I'm not sure if what im feeling is 'normal'?
II'l have a few really really bad days being depressed. They are very panicky depressed days where i even rang my psychologist on the weekend because I didn't  know what to do, they were closed unfortunately. Some days are seriousy good. Like a little too much, for example, I had to go into a shop, but wanted a coffee & smoke first, bunnings was next door so I ducked in to get my coffee, got the coffee but also $100 of plants. Ill clean out cupboards, and constantly do things around the house to the point I don't eat all day, then I feel good about that, my tummy is empty and feel like I'm winning. I have to make myself go to bed by 12am, otherwise I could stay up for hours more. Im not sure if the medication has taken away some social anxiety but most of the time i can talk to people now, but not sure if I'm talking too much to them & i sort of wonder after the chat if i was being wierd. Iv even talked to strangers in the shops which I would never do before. I feel that there' is so much to do but so little time in the day..
Is this what to expect?

Sometimes, when overwhelmed with negative thoughts, I find myself saying ""okay have 20 mins to just lie down and give in to the negative thoughts"". I will lay there, and just sought of ""bathe in the depression"". I will completely let go of any techniques I use to try to offset my bad mood, and just be absorbed by it. I will tell myself horrible thoughts in my head and absolutely be engulfed in self-loathing and criticism. And strangely, it feels sort of as if I am getting pleasure out of this? or it is like a little treat and then I will get back to trying to remain positive later on. Am I the only one who seems to do this?

Hi, 
I believe Ive been severly depressed now for a long time. I tried to seek help a few times in the past but the underlining feeling of helplessness and mistrust I felt made me cease all treatment. I felt a numbness in life like I was either nothing or enjuring extreme emotional pains over and over again via painful memories.
I grew up in a very dysfunctional family where my parents divorced and my mother is what I believe to be a covert narcisist. She used splitting tactics between us siblings and often we communicated to each other via her and not directly. Any type of confrontation or issue was squashed down and denied unless it was a problem for my mother it didn't exist.
No surprises I am very distant from them all today in my mid 30s.
I endured alot but it became too much a few years back. My aunty passed away from cancer and while I was not that close to her leading into the illness I did the best I could to care for her pets who she loved dearly and drove her to and from the hospital for treatment. It pained me at this time to see the way my family acted towards her and each other. My mother particularly started acting up and playing the look at me Im the greater victim here dont worry about her and stole alot of attention away from my aunty who needed it most at this time. My mother and aunty were also spit growing up by my grandmother whom I also believe to be a covert narc.
It was also at this same time I started a new job and was under alot of pressure to perform. My father also popped up and became unemployed and refused to seek assistance at the risk of homelessness. I helped him best I could at the time. 
At the same time without going into much detail my manager at work was nothing less then a terrible person started a situation that pushed me over the edge. She did this knowing my aunty had just passed away for reasons I am not sure of as I was performing well. 
At this point I broke mentally, left my job and started travelling without any thought.
 For 2 years I travelled abroad. I also spent alot of time in isolation when not travelling and had no trust or expectation in people anymore. 
Now I cant find a job even though I have a solid resume due to what I believe is the 2 year gap I took travelling and my confidence is very low.I dont know what to do about finding stable work but I just keep trying anyway. 
I am going to seek help tomorrow and it feels good to finally surrender as I know I can't continue like this alone anymore.

Hi, I’m a 44 year old single Mum of 4 amazing sons, 19,17,15 and 12. 
To most people I look like I’m an organised loving mum and nurse but I know that isn’t really the case.
i have struggled with depression for years and can hide it well. When I work, I am this amazing person who runs a unit effortlessly and is well respected and loved by her colleagues. Then I go home .... and all I want to do is go to bed and sleep or watch Netflix. 
The boys spend far too much time on the Xbox or watching tv as I just don’t have the energy to do anything. I look after their needs..... feed them, wash for them, keep up a happy appearance most of the time, but I never do anything with them. Just do what I have to then retreat back to bed. 
I hate being like this but I don’t know how to claw my way out of it. 
Can anyone help?

I know some people suffer from depression as a chemical imbalance, and others are depressed because of their circumstances. If there is no imbalance, then it is unlikely antidepressants will help. Or do the drugs just make you numb so that you learn to just put up with the situation, rather than dealing with it? Like brainwashing, instead of fixing the problem you just learn how to put up with the suffering in a socially acceptable way. 
Then throw in the therapist for good measure - they can tell you how even though your life is stressful, you are just dealing with it wrong. Maybe I am not dealing with it wrong. Maybe I just have TOO MUCH STRESS. What can a therapist do about that? How can a psychiatrist make your life less stressful just by talking about it? Talking doesnt change the circumstances. All the psychotherapy in the world wont make people any nicer, or the world a better place to live in.

I went off my medication and stoped seeing my theripast last year because my parents pressured me to. I chose to in the end because I was too anxious at the the sessions with my therapist and never ended up improving anything. My parents complained about the cost of therapy and told me that the drugs weren't helping me and were actually unhealthy. I'm scared to tell them how scared and sad I feel all the time for no reason. I act normal and try not to show it and everyone has been telling me how much better I'm doing. But I'm really not enjoying anything and I spend so much time mulling over trying to find joy in anything I never really feel happy. I always want to go out with my friends but when I do I feel like I'm searching for a feeling that isn't there anymore and feel isolated from them. I'm not sure if I would be able to go back on medication or see a therapist again but I'm not really sure how to feel good about myself either. I keep taking on new projects and trying my hardest to help people but it's hard because I feel so alone and no one really wants to help. It's scary talking about it because I feel like when I told people last time they treated me different and my parents tell me how happy they are that I'm better. I don't feel better. I dont really know what to do. But I don't feel like it's going to get better soon. It's so hard to get up for school in the morning and the whole day I'm just waiting to come home. I'm tired all the time and I can't sleep at night feeling like this. I don't understand any reason why I could feel this number empty or alone mabye I'm just making up that I'm depressed. I'm going to school fine and I'm not failing classes anymore. I'm so confused and scared I don't really know what to do. I feel like no one really likes me no matter what they say and nothing I do is right no matter how well I go or what people say about the end result. It's so exhausting. I just want to give up. Sorry I don't really know how to end this or how to post on a thread but I would appreciate some advice

Hi I am 40 have had depression since I was a teenager. I have never taken antidepressants because I’m scared of the physical effects because I’ve also had a lot of health problems and I’m super into natural therapies. I just had a terrible weekend I came to visit my family and bc of my depression I was horrible to be around and just made them all feel sad and bad like a toxic explosion. I love them and hate that this happened. I think if I could have someone who I could be honest with about my feelings and thoughts even though I know they are negative and crazy right when they arise that that could help me? Instead of it getting stuck inside and just escalating till I want to die.

first off hi,
 the last year  I was pretty sure I was suffering from depression but I hadn't and still haven't been officially diagnosed. Since then I've still suffered from those symptoms and it went away for a while but in those 3 months, I had some anxiety attacks. I'm am now okay and not having them anymore and haven't for quite a few months but since I've been noticing some symptoms consisting of random bits of anger with no cause, I would spend weeks sad and depressed with no energy loss of appetite and overall tiredness. because of this I thought I had depression symptoms again but then after weeks of that I would be more talkative or I would feel like I would need to keep talking , I would feel as though it couldn't stop thinking and that I wouldn't need much sleep as well as the fact that I would get distracted very easy .  the happy episodes were smaller but I felt a significant change personally . 


After a while, I typed these symptoms into the internet to see if they relate to anything or just depression. now I know that the internet isn't very reliable when it comes to diagnosis but I discovered that they were symptoms much like Bipolar Disorder.
But more closely related to type two Bipolar disorder. since I've read several things on Type two bipolar and bipolar in general. the other day I spoke on chat with someone from beyond blue and they told me that my symptoms were related and are always possible.  but I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to ask my mum to see a GP because it getting very tired of not knowing . does anyone have any tips?
Thankyou From Char

Hi all, 
Just thought I would engage the community for a bit of support if not just to get some negative thoughts off my chest. 
I've unfortunately taken a backwards step in my battle with depression. I'm having a particularly difficult time despite so much support and great things in my life. 
Full disclosure; I should be happy. My life has been objectively getting better and some unfortunate past events (abuse as a child) are well and truly behind me.
It's scary, this ""episode"" because everything is so much better now yet I feel so awful. I can't sleep. I starve then over eat. I'm losing concentration in university and work (two opportunities I'm very grateful for) and I feel more and more like a burden. Not to mentiom physically I feel weak and often restless/anxious.
I've sought help and I'm receiving it, friends and family doing a great job. Medication forthcoming will hopefully help. 
I guess what I want from this thread is, how do you deal with depression when everything is right? Why does this happen? How do you turn that positive energy around you into an internal motivator? 
thank you so much for reading my post. Just in writting it my mood has shifted in a positive way. I hope this message finds you all well and that we all get through this. Thanks beyondblue for making this forum. It's been very helpful!
cheers

I don't get it!! I try hard, very hard in life!! I've stopped drinking, I have a conscience, I treat others with respect and try and live life right. Just because I haven't done anything dramatic or hit the traditional rock-bottom I feel people don't understand the hell I go through. They don't see or know that every day for me is a personal hell of over-thinking, self-doubt, resentment and loathing of the way my life has panned out. I haven't had any relationships with women ruined for instance (a common ""rock-bottom"" consequence with men) because quite simply I've never been able to develop one. It is so hard going every day so alone and misunderstood!! 
I hate going to GPs and just getting the same mental health assessment done when the stuff going on in my head is so difficult to explain. I am persevering with my medication for fear of the withdrawals if I suddenly stop. I do not want to have to try another sort if these are not working or is this as good as the medication is going to be for me?? Starting from scratch with new tablets will make life even more difficult to manage when other people don't understand me as it is!!
I am intelligent (I have 2 degrees) and a hard worker but it is so difficult to do anything with my career that I can manage properly emotionally and mentally. It is so frustrating, I sometimes wish I was unintelligent and did not give a stuff, it would be be easier to live with myself at the end of the day!!
Can anyone out there get an idea of how I feel or maybe feel the same as I do??

Hi,
 I’m not too sure this will be a good idea to find out about what I’m suffering since I have no courage to see my GP. Basically I have been so sad, feel so lonely and don’t wanna do anything. I could not sleep thoughout the night. I have been thinking of my mum almost every day She passed away in 2012. My life lately has been so difficult. I’m struggling with living and more importantly with relationship. I often think about sleeping away and never have to wake up to face those problems. Apart from that I’m still doing ok with my job. But when I’m alone or have a fight with my partner My thought would drift in to negative side. I never told anyone even my family. Am I just being sad or am I depressed?

My life is controlled by mental illnesses I try not to let it control me but no matter how hard I fight the anxiety and depression it stays. I have suffered anxiety and depression since I was 16. I had tried to make something of my life as a teenager by finishing school and getting a job but since I moved out with my partner 5 years ago I haven’t been able to work or study again since. The anxiety makes it hard for me to leave the house and socialise with strangers. I have hardy any independence and rely heavily on my partner to get me to appointments or even to travel to see my family an hour away as I’m terrified to catch a bus on my own. I’ve been on medication and seeing social workers and phychologists for the last 6 years with only very small improvement. I’m trying to look after myself and get all the professional help that is available to me I can get but doesn’t seem enough. I constantly worry about the future I will have as a result of my mental health and the toll it takes on my partner. Anyone else in a similar situation or have any advice?

I’m a 24-year-old female who was first diagnosed with depression, GAD and PTSD and 16. I grew up in a turbulent and violent household which had an overwhelming impact on my life. Since then, I have always been on this “roller coaster” of mental health. Consistent highs and lows. Now at 24, I feel more confused, afraid and alone than I ever have before. I have no one to talk to about what is going on in my head, and when I have talked about it I’m met with responses such as: “do you think you’re the only one?” and “all you do is complain and I’ve reached my threshold with you”. This has come from family, friends and worst of all, my partner. I feel so desperately alone and I’m struggling to maintain my life. I work 3 days a week and attend university and every single day is a battle to manage, both work and uni have suffered because most days I struggle to leave my house. 
For the past 2-3 years, I’ve been addicted to smoking marijuana. It is a secret that I have kept from every single person in my life, and it’s the only thing that helps me to feel ok. I have no motivation to do anything else, I don’t enjoy anything that I used to enjoy. 
I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to live but I’m too scared to die. I don’t know who to talk to or where to turn. I feel like I’m being tortured by my own mind. I just don’t know what to do and I’m scared. I just want to be understood

For at least the last 10 years I’ve had depression episodes, I’d be on medication and have another episode switch medication or up the dose and maybe 3 months later the episode would go away. I would be going to therapy pretty consistently and I managed to treat anxiety and panic disorder pretty well with therapy and medication and I’m a few years free of panic disorders and anxiety that really impacts my life. However I haven’t seen anywhere near the same change with depression. I usually have depression episodes that last 3-5 months regardless of medication and therapy. This time I’m not really sure if medication is even helpful and it might be better to ride it out since they haven’t worked in such a long time. Other than regular exercise, maintaining a routine, eating good food, as much sunlight as possible is there anything that might help reduce the severity? I do still see my psychologist who is also pretty stumped at how to deal with it.

I have suffered from depression and anxiety as long as I can remember (about 30yrs). Like most people, I have been willing to try anything to make the pain stop. I have given up asking the doctors for help, and given up on trying any more medications. I have tried exercise, mindfulness, affirmations and every other suggestion under the sun (including drugs and alcohol). Nothing I have tried has made this life meaningful.
One of the most common suggestions I hear is to talk about my feelings. There is 2 reasons why this is nearly impossible for me. The first is I have no-one to talk to, no one willing to listen. The second is, from my past experience, talking about things only makes the situation worse. When I see/hear people talking about their feelings and asking for help, I notice that others often respond with sympathy, empathy, or even pity. And the same old same old - tomorrow will be better, find someone to talk to, exercise, meditate blah blah blah.
Maybe this approach is helping some people, but to me having complete strangers trying to reassure me is again, meaningless. Having people say nice things and ""caring"" (for the few minutes that I have their attention) does not in any way make my life easier or more bearable. When I go to bed and get up again the next day- these people aren't there to help me get through the day. They are only listening because it makes themselves feel good.
Am I so messed up that I am just a cold heartless bitch? Or is there something else that I haven't tried yet? Please don't suggest that i try to ""write these feelings down"". Again - that is just another way to make it easier for you to deal with my depression. If people actually cared, wouldn't they be here helping me? If no one cares enough about me to call me or visit or contribute to my wellbeing, why would I want to share my innermost feelings? Just so I can have the pleasure of hearing you say something ""nice""? If I am asking for help, I dont want nice words. Nice words are just a waste of time - yours and mine

Hi All, 
Well I've finally taken the first step to ""fixing my broken mind"" and making my life work this time around for I want a life free of negative thoughts and despair. Currently I am in a progress of medication, counseling, eating well, getting sleep and doing positive thought practices. Have found a site called pinterest  which I find rewarding for things that I like doing, check it out. This illness is such a destructive mechanism in our brains and I would not wish it upon anyone for that matter!!! Family is so important when we are in these times of decline but I believe that we can make change for the better if we choose to fight it rather than let it fight us!!! I have changed some things in my life so far for the good with just retraining my thinking process and find it does work with constant day to day positive thinking. A lot of my depression has come from long term unemployment, financial stress but also a hereditary gene in my family.  I am willing to beat this ""Black Dog"" and make my life better!!! I have made a folder with positive thoughts that I can reflect on each day which helps a lot I must say, things in my life and the way I think and want to change, also I try to focus on the future and not reflect on the past. I do not drink alcohol any more, period, this is such a bad coping mechanism for us, never solves the problems, just makes it worse than it really is!!! I am grateful that we have websites like Beyond Blue because talking about our issues is one of the best starts we can make to a better positive life. Retrain that brain everyday with the tools that you need, I guess we are like cars somewhat, if we don't service them regularly they break down so it is important to eat well and get rest when required to build up our brains and body. In my past I have been to some VERY dark places and now choose never to go back and if something in life presents dealing with it in a different way I find is the key to making positive happy thoughts overrule this. Thanks for letting me pop in and say hello, share my thoughts and desires, you can beat this but sometimes it takes time and the right tools. 
Take Care of you all.

Hey Everyone,
I'm 31 years old, single, currently working in the Fitness Industry as a Personal Trainer, living at home with Mum and siblings. I have depression and mild anxiety/social anxiety that have been clinically diagnosed but have not ever used medication to treat these. 
I have had CBT Therapy before and have been told that I have a fear of attachment from my Parents divorcing as a 12 yr old and that my Mother's voice I have also created to be a trigger for my depression. 
I had a Law Of Attraction life coach for a year up until recent and found it to be complete waste of time and money. From the audio tapes to the goal setting methods, and the skype sessions, then the application of these into the real world with the expectation of significant long-term desirable changes relying purely on belief and ""letting go"" I found very airy-fairy and had no concrete evidence of progression, in fact I felt that I went backwards.
It is not a very stable profession working in the fitness industry. The Market is oversaturated and the pay is ordinary like below $40k p.a. My career options are limited given that I was not an academic in school. Still can't decide what I want to do in life for a career, tried online uni course couldn't do it and am paying hecs off, options are limited as the longest I've held a job is 2 years and at the age where employers are less likely to consider as an apprentice. 
In comparison to both my younger brothers that are fully qualified plumbers and my sister that manages a team of 8 sales reps for the biggest stationary supplier in Australia.
This affects me in every area in life particularly as I've only had less than a year and half relationship experience with 5 different partners in which I did not find attractive. The concern is that not only do I doubt that I can have someone attractive but if I were to get lucky then it wouldn't last because I can't support a family, let alone myself comfortably. I do not connect much with my siblings as I'm the eldest and have achieved very little compared to what they have in a career sense. This makes me jealous, envious and feelings of no self worth as a man.
 Don't have many friends. I don't go out and often stay in my room to watch tv series or live promiscuously by going on online dating sites then meet with women that I don't even find attractive for casual fun or even worse case paying for sex. I neglect taking my dog for walks and find it hard to get motivated to train or work hard.

I had a falling out with my best friend about two months ago (no chance of reconciliation) and have been stuck in a depression ever since and have begujn to eat as a form of punishment. 
I have put on almost 6kgs in two months and I am so disgusted with myself that I continue to eat unhealthy food as punishment.

Hi all I’m so glad I found this place. Already reading through other’s comments and posts I feel not so alone. I hope it makes others feel this way too.
ive struggled with depression and anxiety for over 10 yearsnow and it is a cycle. Once I think I’m through it, it starts again. Today is one of those days I can’t get out of bed which makes me feel guilty and pathetic (not saying that anyone here who can’t get out of bed are those things)  and like I’ve taken a step or three backwards. I just can’t see a happy future for myself and feel like it is always going to come back. I have a full time job, a good partner though I’ve been questioning whether it feels right being with him anymore (don’t know if that’s the depression talking) and see a psych once a month or so. I’m a bit hopeless at the moment.. any support or advice would be great, thank you

im not happy anymore. I know that for sure. but I dot talk about it to my mother because she never listens. she never does anything anymore, we used to be so close and now we can't be further apart. it has gotten to the point where I have learnt to say goodnight to myself because no one else will. I hate talking about my sadness because I hate sympathy. I have learnt to cope without attention to my feelings and so when someone asks me its so foreign and I don't like it. my soul hovers around this fake happy girl when she is at school to make it seem like im okay and nobody would notice but then when I am isolated with my thoughts the real me comes out.my hate for attention Maes it hard for me to speak out about my pain and see help because I don't like the foreign feeling. I have no love in my life and its slowly cutting me off. I feel so alone and im one.

Hello.
I've been struggling with depression for a bit more than three years now. Recently I've hit a pretty low point in my life, and I found that my motivation to be productive with uni work has become almost none. I can manage to get myself out of bed and go about my life, while it may not be all that exciting, it's something. I will be seeing a psychologist within the next week to manage this, but before then I can't exactly ask them for advice.
While I was at school, towards the end of the year I noticed that my motivation to do work was becoming less and less. This became an issue because of exams, but I managed to do enough to not struggle through them. Now I'm at uni, and I find that I can see the same problem arising, although this time I've practically lost all motivation to do my work. 
I love the course I'm doing with all my heart, but I just can't seem to get myself to be productive about the work anymore. At home when I go to do my work, I find I just sit at my desk doing something other than what I'm supposed to be doing. Same goes for being in my lectures and studio session, I always seem to avoid the work, or not go in altogether.
Sure, I've never loved doing school or school work, but I certainly know how important it all is, and I was never afraid to study that bit longer then the recommended time. Now that uni is more mature and stricter about deadlines, I'm unsure as what to do, particularly with the end of the semester coming up I can't get the date extended. This reason also makes me hesitant to speak to my lecturers, as not much can really be done.
I was wondering if there could be any motivation tips/techniques that would be useful in my circumstances. Or is there anything else that could be recommended?
Thanks

Hey,
So for a while now I've been feeling pretty worthless. I live a pretty active life but I can't do any work (school work), am waking up tired, not sleeping enough, eating poorly, and there is also stuff going on with my friends at school, which makes me really irritable and depressed etc. My main issue is that I think I need help but I'm too scared.
I don't want to talk to my parents about it, and I've talked to one of my close friends but I think I need more help. Can I book a GP appointment if I am under 18? If I want to see a psych I have to go to the GP first in oder for medicare I think. Even still, I'm scared to talk to someone I don't know. I think I'll break down crying straight away and not be able to talk.
Any advice?
Thanks

I guess I’m just wanting to write down how I’m feeling/have felt for the last few months as it seems unusual. I have a great job, wife, kid, house and yet lately overall I’ve been feeling bummed out. On paper it looks like I’ve ticked all the boxes and shouldn’t have anything to be sad or unhappy about as there are many people who would see my life as great  yet I still feel crappy. I’m not a talker of my feelings as such and I think the anonymity here is helpful.
i have plenty of support but I really find it difficult to broach the subject to people that know me. Further, I then don’t want to be treated with kit gloves as a result.
I get plenty of exercise and remain motivated, eat well and generally do all the things I’ve read that say “this is what you should do to be happier and healthier” yet again I still feel unhappy
ultimately, I think I feel guilty that I have everything most people want out of life yet I’m not happy with my life...
just wondering if anyone else has felt this way and in a similar scenario and what they’ve done to combat he negative feelings

Hi there.
I am a 36 year old woman who is 7 weeks pregnant and struggling with a low mood. I have previously had anxiety and depression and I am on a safe medication to controlle it through my pregnancy.  But unfortunately at this stage its not doing much for me. I'm struggling right now with hormones and feeling I'll and it reminds me of being in one of my depression states as the symtoms are the same.  At some points it makes me have my growing baby and I feel guilty for that. Just won't to know if any one ells has experienced this and does it pass as the pregnancy progresses. Please help.

I am turning 66 in a week and have had a terrible 5 weeks where I have been hit by a sudden and unexpected bout of depression and anxiety for the first time in my life!! This has been very disabling and I have been struck by the severity of it and confused about what I need to do about it. The strength of my reaction seems out of proportion to a recent crisis in the family but it seems to have raised a lot of issues that I just keep ruminating over. I am waking at 3am and spending hours dwelling on various issues. I have been feeling very flat and have no energy. But the most dramatic thing is how anxious I feel!! I have always been a bit shy at parties etc but this is very different - I am restless and agitated, and feel a little sick in the stomach and chest a lot of the time.
The main reason I am making this post is the surprise I have felt with the suddenness of this situation and incredible powerlessness I feel in dealing with it. I have been quite happy to talk to my partner and close friends but there is a real issue about how much to keep talking about it and how much to ""take control back"" by trying to be positive etc
Wondering if other people - particularly in my age group - have any similar experience or insights
Best wishes to all
Open for joy

I was broken from a young age.. my toxic parents didn't help me develop certain skills... but that was ok, I tried my best with no support, I worked my fingers to the bone in factories not knowing what my future held. I eventually got out the factory and still work on my career on a daily basis.And try to get ahead. But an overwhelming depression and lack of energy for life coupled with bad choices bad friends and toxic family has left me alone sitting on the couch every minute I am not at work. Fat. And isolated beyond the ability to pull myself out of a hole. Without the energy to light up a room I have now found I am even struggling at work now.. working in male dominated industries you need to be aggressive or you will not survive. My fear is I am a train heading in the direction of a family-less , lonely , broken down body and empty life type town for which I tried my best to avoid. And this train is an express

So I had a really, really bad time lately. And despite me really, honestly trying to minimise the support I asked for from my friend, apparently it was too much, and she said that she couldn't be there for me at that point, and that I'd been ""over-using"" her (not her words). And while obviously that hurt me a lot, I can concede that it's her right to do so: if she doesn't feel that she can help for whatever reason, it's absolutely OK for her to pull back. She has to take care of herself.
But now I'm unsure how much I can ask people for support. My other two main supports are good friends, but one of them has anxiety issues, and the other has depression, and I don't want to cause extra stress on them, and clearly I can't tell if I'm going overboard. So the last few weeks I've been trying to handle things myself without asking for support, but frankly I'm not doing well. And over the last couple of days, while I haven't fallen back to where I was before, it's been a definite downward trend, despite my honest best efforts.
In addition, this whole situation has led me to thinking that maybe my thoughts aren't entirely off-base. That I am a burden on the people around me, and I should pull away from them for their own good. I know that's not healthy, but... well, it's hard not to reach that conclusion, isn't it?
I do have the occasional good day, and I try to take advantage of them as best I can. But it just seems like all that does is slow the descent. And I've seen where that descent goes. I don't want to go there, but I can't see a way to divert the track.

Hi all,
My name is Paul. I am a 48 year old male and I am having a really hard time with my depression. I have been unemployed now for over 2 years  since the last paying job. Times are tough and the bills have hit the roof. I feel that I have no purpose anymore and have been able to manage my depression for about 18 months. The last 6 months however I can not sleep more than 3 hours at a time, I get anxiety about my future, I am not eating properly, I think dark thoughts that are uncontrollable and that scares me and finally I have come to the point of being suicidal, but just don't have the balls to do it!! I am losing my mind and my resolve to handle this naturally and may need medication to get me through this. I don't like medicating myself. I don't have ANY faith in the pharmaceutical companies and their placebo agendas to rape the world of money for NO CURE!! As you can see I am broken. Life has broken me badly and now I want out. I don't go out anymore and feel very uncomfortable around other people. 
It is however good to vent and get it off your chest. This is the therapy I have used to get me by for the last 18 months of my 2 year hiatus. I am a majorly qualified individual and have 143 IQ. I am no idiot!! This makes me borderline insane and depression bring it out in me. I feel better to get all this off my chest. Thanks for letting me make your ears bleed, but this is what is going on in my head. Dark times indeed!!!

Fully investing myself into my tutoring work and my teaching studies, I have been shrugging off fatigue and pretending that by ignoring my personal crises they may somehow disappear the next time I look. Alas, recently I have been staring into that particular void and I did not find it wanting. There is much love in my life, the love of friends which means a great deal to me. There is the love of teaching, the love I have for my students and my great work with them, but I have little love for myself.  What I lack is human companionship, the intimacy of the human creature.
This lonely state of mind is entirely self imposed and I pose the question to myself almost as an excuse: ""How can I expect another life to love me if I cannot love myself?."" How can I with good conscience enter into another live and introduce into it the myriad of identity crises I possess, my dark, vindictive yet ultimately confused mind, my sensitive sexuality, my frustrated identity and my nerdy, highly personal theatrics? 
I have long been burying my personal desires underneath my work and now that they have been abruptly unearthed and let loose in my mind, I don't know what to do with them. I've prided myself on my cold, distant attitude toward sexual relations but it is increasingly hard to reconcile that pride with my loneliness and mental health. In an effort to be a messianic figure to my students, their spiritual guide through these dark and troubling times, I have ignored myself and my needs. 
I have never been in a relationship and aged 25 there is a certain shame that comes with the acceptance that I've never been in a sexual relationship and my immediate reaction is to withdraw, but I cannot push this away for much longer. I am not a creature of casual relations, I am a creature which values permanence, predictability and sensitivity and none of those conditions are encouraged by modern match making. I enjoy meeting people in person but I am not a social flower, I don't ""do"" fun, I don't do parties, I don't dance, I don't drink, I don't club and I don't do things like tinder. 
I am the uncompromising autocrat of my own realm but am I going to have to show a gesture of compromise to the cosmos in order to find new people?

Hi everyone,
I just want to vent out my feelings, as I've always been a very reserved person, and I share little except perhaps with a few close people. This is a first for me, I've never really made an effort to join a group, but the time has come, I think.
My depression started about 3 to 4 years ago, I think it was due to someone close to me developing dementia, and it had slowly been tearing away at my happiness and mindset (I'm sure someone could perhaps relate to this). It then started to tear at my confidence, and my motivation to get up, or get out of bed even. I've lost focus at uni, I can't concentrate well enough, and I feel as if I'm a human robot, trudging along day by day, and I feel as if I have fixed that fake ""smile"" in place for hours just so that people could see me as a strong, independent person. But I could only describe my thoughts as intense feelings of loneliness, as if I am walking along a dark gravel road, in a very, very deserted forest. It's cyclic. The thing is, I've tried to change my mindset, believe me. I've tried to talk to a therapist, but every time I make an effort to get back up, I fall back, and it's harder to get back up the next time. I'm tired, and I feel as if I am falling into a dark place. It's so exhausting. I'm blessed, I really am, to be here, to have a roof over my head, but sometimes I feel so numb that my tears have stopped falling. And I understand how lucky I am, and I've tried to see that, but these thoughts (sometimes indescribable), keep tearing away at my soul. I feel restless, but I'm motionless. My social life is appalling, and I don't feel like interacting with people anymore. It's as if my brain is fighting different battles at once. I also suffer from extreme anxiety, which may have caused my depression. I can't recognise that happy girl from years ago. Every time I look in the mirror, I become more invisible. I haven't shared much, but I just hope that somebody can relate, or perhaps someone similar to me, doesn't feel lonely once reading this. The reason I've written this, is I have very little hope left. But hope inspired me to share my thoughts.
Thank you for reading this.

Hi, 
I really dont know if this is the place or whether this is the right thing to do but I dont know who I can talk to. 
Back story - I was diagnosed in 2013 with depression. Went on a mental health plan and seeked counseling with antidepressants over 6 months and felt that I was on the mend and I came off them myself which I know wasn't the right thing to do however, I seemed to have really had my head screwed on. A lot has happened in the time, new relationship, new job, moved to a new area. However just over 12 months ago(3ish years after I stopped antidepressants and counseling), I quit my job with the support of my fiance as I was unhappy, over worked and it was affecting our relationship. I was crying every night, tired, moody and always arguing. I thought leaving work would help change the situation however, I believe it was the beginning of where i am at today... numb. I cant find joy in anything, I struggle to get myself moving, I'm always worried about doing the wrong thing or upsetting someone. I dont keep anyone close or talk to anyone about how I feel. What's worse about this time is I still spoke to my mother and my friends about how I felt, but I cant stand to be that open with them anymore. I feel all over the place and I feel I cant ask for help because I've already done that... and I feel like I wont be taken seriously. I really dont know if anyone else has been in a similar situation or not but it would be nice to hear some advice on what you have done or think I should do.
 
I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense.
xx

Hi all.
this is mick.
so I’ve been going through life like a roller coaster ( like most) and enjoyed the ups and been through the dark deep tunnels. I’ve recently turned 30 last year - after spending my twenties on what felt like a constant uphill. I seriously became self Centered beyond belief and missed so much time (quality and wisely spent) time with important people in mylife, resulting in many episodes, etc etc as you can and may imagine - I feel sober from my self reflective war zone today like I can’t describe I feel I have instead of being the centre of the iniverse have ( after some tremendous recent downers - visit to hospital suicidal to name one from thehelp and escorted by my mum there who put the hammer down to get me there. So today I find myself alone in my home, realising there’s so much to live for - being kind and discovering more about the people who tre at me right ( also parting ways finally with a handful that blinded my heart)or better said, I looked to and called upon as one would stare at the sun. ( negative, bad, all that stuff as the labels may be used u know......) anyways opting to open my heart up again. Mabe find more positive people to have in my life like I’m lonely nights like this - i thought I’d sha re for someone out out there that may connect. I believe in all the hardships in life and battles love always wins! Like someone wise once said if we turn to love - Everyone wins.

Hi everyone, 
I’m a bit nervous posting but keeping things in is what has got me here. (Sorry this is going to be a bit of a long one)
It started a good decade ago when I left school and unfortunately messed things up for myself due to drug use. I had a perfect life and lost so much in a short period of time and found after that I have always been scared of things falling apart. This has given me anxiety and made me live in a bit of a box. I spent my time working hard and piecing a stable life together. Over the years the anxiety grew, I lost my dad unexpectedly; but I continued pushing through. 
Last year was my 10th year in my job and I had set myself up, built a house etc and felt I was in such a great place, yet I felt so sad still always. I decided to stop being stubborn and see a dr. I started an anti depressant which helped so much. I decided to treat myself and go overseas, on my own, and I did it! I was so proud of myself and had the best time. When I returned, things at work got really bad for me and my family were in a bad place and I just felt very overwhelmed (my dr also changed my medication because of night sweats and I don’t feel it is working the same) I keep everything in, I knew I would pop. 
I went to a family wedding, I didn’t want to drink and was not going to drink but I drank :( I don’t know what happened but I ‘popped’ no one will tell me what happened except that it was bad. My boyfriend barely looks or speaks to me. I feel sick and so sad and so embarrassed and so disappointed in myself. I’m 32 and I’m a mess! I feel like I can’t face anyone ever again. How could I let this happen when I put all my energy into keeping it together! My number one priority is everyone around me being happy and have I said horrible things to them? Awww what have I done...I don’t even want to know now.

I’m only 13, but feel like I am suffering through some sort of depression. I have researched the symptoms, and can relate, but when I tried to tell my parents they said that I am too young to be thinking like this. I have been recommended to tell a school health officer or counsellor, but am too afraid to speak out, even to close friends. I have attempted some online depression tests which say that I have moderate depression, but I don’t speak out because I am afraid that I am just over-exaggerating and I really don’t have depression, and making a big fuss for nothing. What should I do?

Hi, I'm sorry for how ugly this post is going to be. I've made my account minutes ago and know you're meant to follow some guidelines but I honestly need some help as soon as possible and just want to ensure I actually do this post.
I'm male, 21 and have had mental health issues for a while now. Recently, I met a girl who's now my girlfriend.
I want to do this for her, I want to have my shit together and be strong so I can support her.
so I've recently come to accept I'm suffering from depression. I haven't made any progress in uni for 2 years despite lying to family and friends about it. My parents have been giving me a generous allowance for about 4 years now despite us not being the most wealthy and I've done nothing to get a job in that time. I'm not even justifying the allowance because I'm not getting anywhere with uni. I also don't have my drivers license yet either.
These things aren't due to lack of ability or intellect, I just don't do anything all the time. I only seem to move when I'm going to socialise and even then I don't always feel up to it.
apart from that I spend a lot of time doing nothing, sleeping a lot, pacing a lot, daydreaming. I do nothing all the time.
my work ethic is non existent at this point despite me doing so well in high school I've completely stuffed everything with uni.
so now I'm in a position where I'm always making excuses about not having my license, always lying about not making money and being behind on uni. I even don't tell people about my allowance. I lie about so much.
now I just feel like shit for everybody I've lied to, i love my fam it and friends but none of them would forgive me for this kindness of thing.
I just feel like my life has already gone down as a stuff up
i just want some idea of where to start j

I don’t really know where to start, I wouldn’t say I’m at my worst because there’s definitely been worse times but I just feel so down and lost.
Ive been trying, trying so hard to stay positive, do things that make me happy and trying to put myself first. It helps for a bit but then when I’m alone at night I know I’m not truly happy. Doing things I love brings me temporary happiness, all I want is to be happy with myself but I don’t know if I ever will be.
I don’t have a job, I don’t study it makes me feel like a big failure but I just can’t find anything that’s for me and my anxiety doesn’t help that. 
I have no friends, maybe some acquaintances but people seem to always leave. I know my anxiety might be the reason but it shouldn’t make them leave. Feeling alone is one of the worst feelings, not feeling good enough. I have to pretend I’m happy to make them happy but as soon as I can’t pretend anymore they are gone or hurt me.
Boyfriend doesn’t understand, I’ve tried and trying for me is hard because it’s so extremely personal and it’s like he doesn’t care. He says he does but like right now it’s his birthday next week and all he cares about is sexual things. When I’ve told him how I feel about myself, I know I shouldn’t stay because he deserves better but I’m too scared to make someone feel pain because I know how it feels.
 I love my family above anything else, I’ve lost a lot of them but that’s made me realise how important family is, I feel like such a disappointment to them. I should have a job, growing, moving out but I’m not. I can’t express how I feel to them because I’ve worried them enough, seeing the pain I caused  them is too much. I never want to do that again. 
I think too negatively about myself, I know I do. I love too much, care too much and try to make others happy before myself. I feel like I just need that one person who understands, I want to be understood. 
I know people say doctors help but to me they never have, I don’t want medication I don’t need. I understand and have nothing against it but for me personally this is a part of me and I’m not going to numb it, I’m going to beat it. I don’t trust them from past experiences.
Thank you in advance, I really appreciate it. I just want happiness, with my life and most importantly within myself. I just don’t know how.

Hi all
I have trouble with automatic thoughts constantly flooding my brain and they're usually hard to deal with and get me down. Sometimes I don't let them get me down but I'm going through a patch where it's hard to do that.
My psychologist asked me to think of ways that help me with those thoughts and what makes them better. But I can't think of much.
Can you please share some ideas?
 
Thank you

So after a protracted battle with mental illness, at the age of 30 I got on anti depressants (about 6 weeks ago). I've been feeling actually really like my old self and have been so excited to not be depressed that I've been taking on a lot of missions--I'm back working again and I'm in two bands who have been recording and keeping very busy because I thought my life was very near over a few months ago. The way I explained it to my psychologist was like being told that you were going to die in a few days and then by some miracle you survive and all of a sudden you have this life ahead of you. The depression convinced me that there was no hope and I believed it. But I recovered and I thought it was a miracle. So I hit the ground running and started to make the most of everyday. And this is how I felt when the medication started working--I was so sick for so long that I started making up for lost time and just making the most of my life. The depression was there but it was in the background and no longer controlling me. Yesterday though, after a tough week with what I'll call 'real-world' issues, I noticed I was feeling a bit on the manic side again and slightly anxious about it. My sleep was very weird the past few nights too, where my body was kind of sleeping but my mind was racing and thinking random things constantly. Pretty peculiar. This morning I was sufficiently fatigued to warrant me not going into work and I've spent the entire day watching netflix and doing nothing. Prior to this my sleep has been fantastic and I've been prescribed  medication which I've been taking every night to help me get to bed.
Anyways, last night I saw my psychologist who suggested that I might be developing, or I might have bipolar but its still early days yet. He suggested this because of the way I described my sleep, my elated mood the past few weeks and how I was telling him I was starting to feel mildly manic. This really worried me as it made me feel like the past 2 or 3 weeks of happiness and motivation was a delusion as a result of an organic illness rather than the result of me making some life changes and doing positive things such as getting on medication and the like. Anyways, so he has made me pretty anxious by suggesting that. I have made mania before a major depressive episode which was a few months ago, but not sure what to make of it all right now and I'm kind of worried about the future. How are things like bipolar diagnosed anyway?

Hi,
I am new to this.  I dont know if this is right but it's one of the last thinking spaces I seem to find some clarity, some peace and some affiliation.  It's a places feel people understand what I think and feel in reading other posted but while getting some comfort in that (no offender to others feeling as I do intended), it doesn't change how I feel.
 
I am older well not old but getting up in years now.  I had a great life's decade ago, out, friends and life at a fast pace.  Move forward, divorce and job changes, bills and life just so hard.  I find myself beyond stuck.  I don't go out and don't do anything.  None of my 'friends' call ordo anything g and I hear from nobody.  My family, well only one of them touched base in any meaningful say monthly time period.  I have bills and things out of the whazoo format son and what my ex left after a life of spending everything plus, a lonely and nothing existence it seems to me.  I can't just get out and meet people, it's not me anymore.  I can't afford it anyway.  I can't afford a psych irthe subsidised psych as I have bills and commitments to everything everywhere that I can't keep up. I wake up every day with dread, well that is when I sleep. If I do sleep I don't want to get out of bed.  I am lazy and I hated who I am and everything about who I am now.  
 
I don't know kw what to do anymore.  I have thought lots of Anthony's and searched a lot how to do things.  I don't even have the guts to do anything which is more of why I feel shit.  I can't even do feeling rubbish and doing something a bout it right.  
 
I am lost and so alone.  I have tried to reach out to services but I can't afford the cost of getting help.  I only get - here's a service, call and go see someone.  If it where that easy I wouldn't be here.  I can't afford so that.  I have a son in private school, crippling divorce and past bills from my ex.  I am lost and can't go on line this any more.
 
Does anyone have any advice.  Please don't tell me to just go talk to a psych,if I could have I would have.  I want to but I literally can't afford that and I need help, I want help.  I can't live like this any more.

Hi there,
i just joined this website and was hoping I could talk to others that may be experiencing what I am experiencing.
Due to me starting a new job I've becomed stressed. Therefore my skin has had a lot more acne than normal. Cystic acne however that just won't die down.
 
i decided to see a specialist and they put me on medication.
I was excited at first. I understand the side effects, such as blood noses, possible depression, sore joints, skin getting worse etc etc
 
1.5 months in and my skin has gotten worse- yes I expected it, but it's just so red. It's so much worse than when I started the medication.
Also, I've felt very 'down' lately.
Ive never really been depressed so this is a shock to me.
I just feel terrible...all the time?
i need to go off this medication.
i want to smile, even if I do look bad I need to smile.
 
Can anyone give me any advice on depression and what's it like? I'm scared I don't like this.

First time posting. I have depression and anxiety. I am studying nursing at tafe. I live with my real dad who isn’t able to work atm due to rain. But any money he gets he seems to spend on smokes and random things. I have put in place a budget which isn’t working. I have to buy groceries, care for 5 animals, clean, wash clothes, do stuff for tafe, etc. I don’t take my meds regularly because I forgot or I’m busy. I see a psychology’s every few weeks which isn’t enough but I can’t affoes anymore. I can’t get anywhere unless my dad drives me because I only have my learners. No one is able to give me lessons so I can get my hours up and I don’t have the time. I have my bf and my grandfather. But that’s about it. My bf is great but is also studying but at uni doing law. And he has his own family to deal with. The only friends I have are the ones at tafe. I don’t have much support, money or food atm. I can’t just pause anything or work. I dunno what to do.

Everyday is a struggle. It has been for maybe close to a year now. It's like I don't enjoy the day and I can't wait for it to all pass so it can be night time and I can just go to sleep. I feel like and haven't for a while, like I don't enjoy anything. Things make my anxiety a little bit better i think but I don't often feel many positive emotions. Or maybe I do but just very very minutely? I feel I can't just relax and just be in the moment. I feel like I'm just waiting for night to come so I can just be in bed and don't have to force myself to do anything. 
I know I have depression and will be having my fourth psych session this Tuesday. I have never had depression before (maybe mildly but never enough to really impact me or last long enough). I was diagnosed with GAD four years ago (OCD as a child and have always had anxiety) so am familiar with bad mind numbing anxiety and almost constant panic attacks but not so much these negative feelings. I had a real bad anxiety period over a year ago and i think thats where this depression stememd from if that makes sense.  Despite having anxiety, I have always loved talking to people and doing different things and exploring the world. Now it's just like I want to sit still and do nothing. Everything I do I feel like I'm just passing time so that I can go to sleep and hope that I'll wake up a bit better tomorrow. 
it frustrates me because everything is pretty good in life. I have such an amazing partner, I have friends (I use to be so social now I strugggle), I work but shorter hours now since this newish job, my family is super awesome... I just don't feel much of these positive feelings anymore. I just don't want to engage and this makes me feel bad because I know I'm not this sort of person. I have always been quite positive and could make almost any situation positive.
I also get upset that maybe I'm not making any progress and that this is the new me and I'll always be stuck like this. Some days I have the strength to laugh a bit and engage in conversation a bit more and act better and do more things even if I don't fully feel it. Is that some progress or am I just like this forever now? I used to love joking around and making people laugh and making them feel good now it's like I just don't care and I hate that.
 
Thanks a bunch for reading! Sorry there is so much to read lol

Hi everyone,
i am really struggling with anxiety and depression at the moment. I have seen my GP who has started me on some new medication but I am just so sad all the time. I feel totally worthless and am struggling to get through each day. I keep crying and feel like I can’t do anything right. I feel so alone and that nobody cares. I have no confidence in my abilities and that I don’t know what I’m doing at work. I am studying as well and really have no belief that I can do the work. I just feel like giving up

Hello, this is my first time posting on this site but wanted to get other peoples opinions on my situation. The start of march my girlfriend and myself went on a 3 week holiday overseas...which was great for both of us...so no issues there. But ever since I've returned I've felt like I've been in this never ending slump. Before I went away I was a frequent gym goer and always (for the most part) happy. But ever since I've returned I haven't enjoyed the gym and i actually can't stand to go anymore. I now drink almost every night now which I never did previously. Can't understand or pinpoint what the issue could be...we've been back from holidays well over a month now

The title says it all, I'm at a crossroad in life or some might also say a quarter life crisis. 


Up until about 4 years ago I was a very happy person. I had a great social life, girlfriend, travelled a lot and was essentially completely different.


I travelled around the world for 12 months and moved to the big city when I returned.


Since then I was lucky enough to land a high paying job as a truck driver. After discovering personal finance and self development I made it a goal to try and build wealth, that hasn't worked out how I thought it would.


3.5 years later of saving 80%+ of my earnings, I've reached a point where my anxiety to spend money is drastic. My connections with friends and family have diminished due to being too frugal and my last girlfriend ended up leaving me.


Alongside this, I also decided to get into shape. I've achieved what some might say is a decent physique but that's not all. I thought this would make me confident but it's done the opposite. My insecurities are through the roof and my self esteem is at an all time low as I'm never happy with how I look.


This has been going on for years now. I haven't had even as much as a verbal connection with a girl for 6+ months, my job isn't gratifying (I receive abuse from drivers all day for delivering them food, go figure) and the thought of knowing that this could be the rest of my life scares me.


With all these combined I've found myself at a crossroad where I'm asking myself if this is really all worth it. I don't find joy or pleasure in anything anymore and I feel like all of the advice society gives (get in shape, get financially secure, succeed etc) just isn't for me.


Surely there has to be another way to live than spending 6 days/70 hours a week working, saving everything I earn and torturing my body with exercise I don't even enjoy and eating bland food I don't enjoy just to have a physique that brings a tonne of insecurities?


To end this I guess my question is, have you been here before and gotten out of it? Any advice I receive (i.e work hard, set goals, save money, be disciplined etc) hasn't worked as it's what has gotten me here in the first place.
Thanks for listening.

Hi all, this is my first posting on a forum. I am Bipolar, have been all my life, well, since I can remember anyway. I was always diagnosed as depressed, and I guess that was because of some traumatic events that happened in my life, and obviously I wouldn't come out of that unscathed. I always felt that it was more than that, ( being depressed, or suffering from PTSD), but I couldn't explain it. As I got older and with my symptoms becoming more serious and varied, I sought councilling and was described various medications to stabilize my moods. But nothing helped. I would swing between feeling what I would consider ""normal"", and deep, deep depression, which I could not understand, as everything was okay in my life. To cut a long story short, and to not go into too much, I was resently diagnosed. Bipolar. Well thanks. Even though  it gives me a reason to understand my longstanding behaviours and feelings, and how I've never felt ""normal"", I now have to realise that this is my life. That nothing apart from medication, can help me. Where was the help I needed all those years ago, before I lost my children, my family and my friends?? How could I have expected everyone else to understand why I was like I was, when I never could understand it myself? I am now nearly 57, in my second marriage, which is being destroyed by this horrible disorder, and I'm really sick of it.

I'm 18 and my mother is 46 and for the past 6 years my mum has had severe depression. 2 months ago I moved 3 hours away to go to university, leaving her alone. I feel bad about this but also know its right for my future. Over the past week, she has told me she has no motivation to do anything (walk the dogs, go to the shop, clean the house) and she feels extremely bad about this. She also has no job and no friends. This upsets her immensely as she wants a job yet is unsure that she will ever get one as it has been many years since her last employment. She gets very upset and sometimes states that she no longer wants to be alive and is only here for me. She struggles with alcohol and buys it when she goes to the shop, then gets very sick and falls back into a pit of depression. This makes her afraid to go to the shop and meet people as she thinks she will ruin all her friendships when she is drunk. I just want to know how I can help her, she won't see a psychologist and has no car to get to the doctors to go on another antidepressant (3 different ones tried and still no results.) She has no friends to talk to about this other than me and I feel so unable to help her. 
Please, I need your advice as I love her more than anything and would do anything to make her be happy again.

Hi, 
so I got diganoised with depression and anxiety about a year ago. I know I’ve had it for longer than that though. I’m 22 years old and I just feel utterly worthless. I’ve left two different uni degrees because I either couldn’t handle it or didn’t want to study it anymore. I’ve got a job that barely gives me any hours and absolutely no talent in anything. I don’t have something that I’m good at or passionate about, I’m just numb to everything. I don’t even feel like I have friends anymore. My two “best friends” just booked a holiday without me, they never notice that I’m sad and when I mention it they do nothing but encourage me to drink alcohol. My family don’t understand either, I know they are trying to but they just don’t. 
I’ve never felt so useless in my life and I feel like I’ll always be useless. I have no idea why I’m even here anymore. 
i just have no idea what to do.

Hi Everyone. I am new here and had a nurse at the hospital I am in recommend this site. At the moment I have been in hospital for the last 4 weeks on a Surgical Ward. I have diabetic ulcers on the side of both feet and under my big toe on my left foot which were really bad. After being in for 2 weeks with many x-rays and bone scans it came back that I have osteomyelitis in my big toe. This is a serious bone infection. What they are saying is that the infection from the ulcer on my big toe went into the bone and started spreading. 
Yesterday (Friday 13th) I was moved to from the Surgical Ward to the Acute Rehabilitation Unit at the same hospital and was told that I will be in for at least another 5 weeks. Being in for just 4 weeks isn't helping my bipolar and anxiety as it is. But now having to be in for over another month is not helping me at all.
I am in a room with 3 other guys, a lot older then me, they are in there 80s, and this is really distressing to me due to some things that happened to me by an older guy when I was a child. It has brought my anxiety to the forefront all over again. They are really good at the hospital trying to do what they can. They are trying to get me into a single room to make things easier since I am going to be here for such a long time.
I just don't know how to handle this much more. I want to just leave but the problem is if I discharge myself I will 100% lose my toe, if not my foot is what they are saying. And with what it looks like and the pain (for which I am on morphine every 3 hours) I believe them too.
Any support and advice would be very grateful. Thank you!

It's been a long time now that I've been 'unwell'. Today I even called in sick from work - isn't it sad that I have to make up some physical sickness? Why can't I just say my mind hurts today, I can't work. Anyway, I thought I was getting better, I was working full time, studying full time, occasionally socialising, but recently it's come back - the numb feeling. Does anyone else get this? You're there physically, but your mind isn't, it almost feels like you're not there at all - you're zoned out, and physically you just feel empty. It happens around friends, in class, at work, right now. I'm just completely absent. 
Now I'm having 'sick' days from work, failing courses at uni, not socialising at all. It just takes a full 360. How do you get back to passing, to working, to talking to people? How do you get back to being yourself again if you don't know who you are anymore?

What has helped me almost fully recover with depression is tricking my mind. That is, I usually dont know if a thought, a system or a philosophy works or not...but I'll try anyway based on the logic.
""A ball wont bounce unless it rapidly drops"". We panic when we fall heavily into depression. Being a motivated person Im always looking for the positve...the bouncing ball tells me that there must be a reason we fall into that state and the ball, like our depression must hit rock bottom before the journey to recovery begins. It might not be ""right"" theoretically however when Ive been rock bottom Ive then waited for the up cycle to appear and like that bouncing ball..Went on the rise.
What if that ball bounces down the road.up, down, up, down..many times until one day it bounces into your hand where you can have some control of it. It will..believe it.
Another physics idea is empty/replace. So if you treat your depression as an intruder of your brain. To reduce its size we must replace parts of it with other volume items..like- a hobby, sport, social, activity, jigsaw...keep moving, replace, replace. If you be idle for too long your depression grows. Deptession loves boredom.
Easier said than done? I know, I've been there many times. But this mentality is but one way to assist in beating the black dog.
Stimulation. You are deeply depressed. In a matter of moments you reverse your mind to do the opposite of what you are allowing it to do. Google
Topic: switching mindsets- beyondblue 
Imagine you suddenly decide to go parachuting or paying passenger in a race car?. For myself when I went abseiling down a cliff my depression evaporated for that 15 minutes, and then when I told friends..excitement replaced...
It worked albeit short periods but it worked.
Topic: depression, distraction and variety- beyondblue 
Keep going forward. Fighting it wont work. Out witting it with logic and playing its own game can find improvement.

Hi,  New member, first post (so pls be kind & apologies for rambling!) 
I am married woman with a successful career an turn 35 on Monday.  I am also the queen of the mask- IE no one knows the struggles behind this perfectly crafted facade and according to my counsellor I have having a mid life crisis of sorts- or as I like to call it a ""pre- midlife crisis"". 
I was originally diagnosed with depression and GAD a bit over 12 months ago.The depression crept up on me as I was dealing with relationship issues to the point where I was unable to work or barely leave the house. The diagnosis was almost a relief- as if having a name made this a beast I could identify and then beat (I come from a health background so a label was useful for me). I tried therapy very briefly but had not found the right therapist and I spiraled- I didn't go back. I opted for exercise & trying to deal on my own & was able to pull myself out of the initial crisis, with a probably unhealthy dose of denial and wine. I denied my GP's suggestion of an antidepressant- I didn't need meds!
Fast forward 12 months and I hit breaking point. The straw that broke the proverbial camels back was a work scenario and my response to it was not healthy, I literally did not have the capacity to overcome what should have been a straight up difficult conversation- I cried, drank, reeled for a weekend and barely made it to work on Monday. It was then I realised I needed help. I made an appointment with a counsellor and the ensuing 6 weeks have been an emotional rollercoaster thats on a constant downward spiral. I am learning a lot about myself, and how I got here, I also finally filled the script for those antidepressants- and after 2 weeks feel like the numbing cloud over my head is lifting slightly. 
But I have a way to go- my therapist suggested I take a leave of absence to deal with my mental health, and spend some time truly analysing my life, goals, values, relationships... But this terrifies me- I feel like I might burn everything I have worked so hard for down and have to start again, I also know this could be exactly what I need. 
Keen to hear from others who have worked through similar times, did you take time off, go to a treatment facility, holiday solo? 
If this sounds familiar or resonates in some way I would love to hear from you X

First post so hello everyone.  And pre warning that I'm not great at explaining things.  
 
At 32 I've just begun my second fresh start in 6 years.  I took myself 2k km from my friends and family with a partner, then when things failed in that relationship, I persisted 2 years til now after saving some money and really trying to rebuild myself.  Rebuilding included Drs,  Phsyciatrists,  meds, exercise ect. 
For those two years I was unhappy. And potentially very lonely.  So much so that even now I fly solo and so use to my own company as I never had any support network.  
I have so many issues banked up,  that I didn't know about until my whole routine was changed in coming here.  Naturally,  I'm a stress head.  I've also since Xmas last year not been on meds as the ones that seemed to work I grew somewhat immune to after 14months. 
Anyways,  that's a bit of my history.  There's much more detail in a lot of blanks.  But it seems that I rebuilt nothing until this new move.  
My point of this thread.  After reading these pages for a few weeks,  not really knowing how or what to say,  or if I should even bother.  Is that I'm feeling very off,  or done,  or exhausted.  
I have no ties.  Technically I'm free as,  and a lot of people say they wish they were in my shoes.  But they don't know my insides and what goes on there.  
So here I am.  Fresh start.  I've gone backwards.  Crying when I cook a meal again,  scared to go to the shops,  having panic attacks when I see work uniforms and how I'm unemployed - yet way too not together to be able to even sit an interview.  I refuse to centre link.  I came here by choice after leaving a job.  
Ive never really had beliefs in how society is run. I've lost my motivation, even to enjoy little things.  My attention span is short, restless, even sitting here writing this make me want to delete it and just not even bother cause it takes time.  
I tried opening up a few times.  But I just seem to get categorized and it frustrates me. 
I guess my question is.  What do I do now? I'm honestly exhausted from the last rebuild which feels like it was a waste.  I feel purposeless and a waste myself with no energy to rise again.  
Not how I wanted my fresh start to begin at all.  
Thank you for  sitting through that.  I really appreciate anyone listening.

The battle I continue to have is that there appears to be no rhyme nor reason for my mental descent into this involuntary melancholy. Yesterday, for no explicable reason, I felt in control of my emotions and went about my day just feeling ""normal"". It is such as great feeling when the weight has gone and yet today, right now, and for no reason that I understand, the elephant has returned and sits squarely on my chest and he won't budge. I read everyone's own experience with this ""thing"" and there appears to be a reason for most people in terms of their journey with this debilitating madness. I can't find a reason, well a conscious one at least. Family and friends need to find a reason and constantly tell me why I must be feeling the way I do. It frustrates the hell out of me because they're wrong but they need to hang their hat on something. Is it possible that there is no reason for this solo journey of torment.

Hi all,
I'm a first time poster. 2015 was when I first encountered serious depression.. I had a relationship break up, moved states and had a very sick father.. so I could almost ""justify"" why I felt so bad.. It took me about six months but I eventually got myself out.. but the antidepressants I was put on never game me vitality, they just helped me function day to day.
Fast forward until the end of Jan 2018, and I had another relationship breakdown... this was the catalyst for me to spiral into a major depression (which i'm still in) - although a catalyst, I know it wasn't just this.. I think ever since my last episode in 2015 i've always been right on the edge, but that break up came as a huge shock and pushed me over the edge.
Since 2015, I was on multiple types of medications, fast foward until now and I have a new (but amazing psychiatrist) who genuinely cares and wants to help.. Initially he put me on something different to try and help me get out of the spin but I had a terrible reaction and went into Akathisia.. So for the last month i've been on two seperate and different medications again. 
What i'm struggling to understand is last week I felt so good, like I was getting back to my old self.. and then I woke up on Sunday and had completely returned to that numb feeling of just wanting to die (i'm not suicidal, life just seems pointless). I've told my psychiatrist and he said he's seen it before when peoples mooods go up really quickly that they can come crashing back, and he attributes a lot of it to coming off the other medication about a month ago...
So my question is:
1) wouldn't the AD's have already been out of my system?
2) How can I go down so quickly?
3) Am i just on the wrong drugs?
Sorry for the essay.. I have a very supportive network but none of them experience depression so can't really understand it.

I've been a little lost of late, struggling a little, trying to build up the courage to actually go to a GP and talk about possibly having depression. After weeks and weeks of back and fourth in my head pros and cons. Today a friend asked me if I was okay? That I seemed quieter than normal. 
my first and normal response was to say ""yeah fine just a bit tired"" but today I rhought NO I am going to be brave say no I am not okay. 
As I start d to responded: no not really my 'friend' had already moved on to tell me about how she had been having a bad day. i felt like she had kicked me in the gut. Why ask if you don't care enough to at least listen to response.
Dont by me wrong I am happy to help her out and listen to her bad day(as she put it) but it got me thinking how do you know when to tell someone NO YOUR NOT OKAY. Because ig they don't listen to you it sure makes you feel worse than you did before.

Hello,
I'm new here and this is my first post, and I feel I need to get this off my chest. 
I'm a fresh uni graduate and have just started my first full time job in media and I'm now three months in. This isn't a job I wanted but it was the only place that offered me something, and being a desperate graduate, I took what I could get. Although it's not what I wanted, I figured it would be a foot in the door and I can gain some professional experience, and who knows, maybe it might exceed my expectations.
 
Even though I kept an open mind, this job has been more of a disaster than I thought. Ever since my first day, I have felt like an invader on the team that I work. Although most people are friendly and occasionally chatty with me, I get a very strong vibe that I'm unwelcome. This has been documented numerous times where everyone has gone out in a group to lunch and I didn't receive an invite. Other times I have been invited and I'd say I'll quickly go toilet, and they've all walked off and left me behind and I can't find them. And other times I have gone to sit with them at lunch and the mood very quickly drops and everyone stops talking. Even the other night after work, everyone went out for drinks afterwards and I had no idea. It wasn't until I bumped into them in the lift and another person I didn't know asked me to join, but a few people on my team didn't even acknowledge I was even there.
 
The girl I report directly to is extremely patronising and has gone behind my back to say things to my manager that she could pull me up on herself and simply say, ""please inform me next time"", for example.Her patronising and condescending emails to me often have my manager and director CC'd in them so she appears like she's being a leader, but it leaves me feeling awful about myself and makes me doubt myself and my worth.
 
I was really hoping that considering this isn't a job I was genuinely seeking that the people I work with would make it feel worth it. But everyday I feel miserable, and even on weekends I am constantly thinking about work and it's already taking a toll on my mental health. I stress too much, I always feel down, and I dread waking up every morning. But I'm worried quitting would look bad on me, considering the advertising & media industry in Australia is tiny and everyone knows everyone.
 
Any advice on what to do would be massively appreciated.
Thank you!

I have depression down times, constant depression in the form of Dysthymia  and bipolar down periods. They are all distinctly different.
 
Depression when it hits can make me tired but that is more like what my wife feels and she hits the bed. For me it’s a time when I feel suppressed, emotional, foggy head and no motivation.
 
Dysthymia is a depression that is forever present. Thankfully my positive mind over rides that most times and it is easier to live with.
 
But bipolar down times are the most difficult of all. It’s like living on a cliff edge with your feet trying to push you away from that edge only one day something or someone gives you a push. Over you go. That person is called “life”.
 
One example. We had visitors yesterday. Before they came we cleaned up the house, packed away stuff and even cleaned the car. All was set for a bbq in out entertainment area. We were all seated and my lovely niece commented “there’s a spider web up there”. Boom! The bipolar mood struck. Sensitivity on a global scale! With my bipolar mood it hits like a slap in the face, I can never reply during such a time, I have a desperate need to run away and on this occasion I slipped into my bedroom for a while, deep breaths. In years gone by it would be a case of crying my eyes out but I’m 62 now and I’ve learned a little about how to face the challenge of returning to the group as if nothing happened…after about an hour.
 
It is important to let you know that this bipolar reaction is unavoidable. It’s something we have to live with. I’m on Ad’s (small amount) and mood stabilisers that have a great daily stabilizing effect for me. But its these downers through the slightest trigger that sets me off.
 
To suggest finding courage to return to the fold is an understatement, its taken me many years of changing my mindset of allowing the bipolar to take a firm grip to reversing that trend and returning to normal life and family.
 
So my method/routine is to do this-
 


Remove yourself calmly from the group


Take deep breaths


Find distraction (I get on a forum)


Go for a short walk


Accept that it isn’t the other persons fault


Rejoin the group with a joke or humour


 
You might have your own routine. Can you share it? Have I described the bipolar downer accurately?

I’m struggling to cope with this feeling of complete hollowness. I’ve had this deep sadness in me for years and it just won’t go away. I used to be able to cry, but I can’t even do that anymore.
I’m so so tired and I just want to sleep to stop thinking. I’m so numb that the only thing I can feel other than this unmoving sadness is when I’m lashing out at others. I snap and say terrible things to those around me just so I can feel something. I hate myself for it and I just want to stop it all. I just want it to stop. I hate myself for doing this but I just can’t stop
I don’t want to do this anymore. Please

I feel like i'm sick in the head. Like there's something wrong with me. Some poison in my system that's changing me. Damaging me. My intellect sets me apart from others, I'm not easily fooled. I know all the Psychology and Reverse Psychology that people use against one another and how everything is all me me me and no one gives a damn about us. About what we want and feel. I keep feeling as if my own flesh and blood family has abandoned me. Like no one has my back. No one to turn to and no one to lean on. I feel all alone as I fall into a deep black abyss that no one can pull me out of let alone understand it. People mouth adages and courtesies and pleasantries at each other never meaning anything what they say. They just want to talk about themselves or take your money and don't care about the damage they're doing. I am so sick of this place and so sick of myself.

My mom died about two weeks ago and I was overseas so was not with her. I flew back straight away but she had already gone. It was very sudden. My mom was my best friend, I talked to her every morning and every night, she was my whole world and now she has gone. The pain I feel is unbearable, it’s constant and debilitating. I can’t imagine not seeing her again and it’s killing me. I just don’t know how I will get through this, it feels like it is impossible.

finally got over my anxiety for now lol to ask for advice and strategies in dealing with Centre link and Job providers????
little about me. 7 yrs ago i was able to work full time and was working long hours before i started to get sick and exhausted weekly I resigned when they did not implement my idea's, ways to reduce my stress and dependency on me running the company so i could actually have a sick day  and to focus on health and family. 3 months later i ended up needing multiple surgeries over 2 years for a cyst that was causing the infection and multiple hospital visits for septicaemia.
I have seen every specialist (no definitive results and causes). I am limited to bed most days and now have a herniated disc in my lower back to add to the fun. so pain and fatigue permitting  i am limited to at the moment to 3, 15 min activities a day. needless to say depression and mental problems social anxieties have arisen. Some from me dealing with my new life as well as past trauma. I am and have been trying to ways  (medication,CBT,BT) of dealing with such mental issues. available but have had limited actually mental diagnosis.last time was me seeking assistance to deal with depression 3 months ago. 
Every time i think i am well enough mentally and physical  to even think about work i try to engage people and apply for Centrelink.my anxiety over explaining my issues and vulnerabilities or even asking for help from randoms is one thing, dealing with them and their lack of compassion and understanding when i am exhausted and mentally unstable has caused depressive episodes in the past.usually ends in me having payment suspended.
5 years after the last surgery i have nothing and am soon to be homeless again. I had already been struggling with anxiety about dealing with them.and have now had 2 panic attacks (not diagnosed) When forcing my self make contact this month.
thanks for taking the time to read. I will check replies when able .
 peace out.

I am a 30 year old female, and have had chronic depression since 2013. I had been put on antidepressants, and yes, they do help a bit and make the depression not so horrible to bear. If anything, it stabilises my emotions and the anxiety that comes with it.
I am scared though, because it's been nearly 5 years and I still haven't ""recovered"". The things I get depressed over are fears of my loved ones dead, homelessness and being alone all my life. Until 2013, I never used to think about these things to the extent I do now, and certainly never used to let it bother me to the point where I get panic attacks or start crying.

I'm still working out if I'm dealing with a possible lifetime of depression or maybe these thoughts are normal, and everyone thinks them?
The good news is, since 2015, I have gained control over depression and had found happiness in my activities again by building up on small pockets of enjoyment, until those pockets of enjoyment start growing and fill the hole in my heart again.
So while I'm dealing with life a lot better (and mostly done this on my own efforts), I still sometimes have the odd night when I crawl to bed because I don't want to face anything, and think about upsetting things that I believe I must face one day.
Can depression last a life time?

Hi All, 
I would really appreciate your advice and help. 
My husband is clearly going through depressive phases again and again. The last one (he is not yet really out) has been one of the worst and longest lasting. Ever since I noticed these recurring phases, I have read up a lot about depression and noticed over time that most of his behaviours and the things he says are clear symptoms of depression. I subsequently read up a lot on what can be done and how to help and I have managed to propose to him to see a psychologist more than once. Unfortunately in the past, they did not help much and the treatment was not for long. This time however, he has been seeing a psychologist for about six or seven months and it seems to help him, albeit very very slowly. However, although he realises that he feels depressed sometimes, he seems to not want to accept that this may actually be ""the real deal"", i.e. real depression that he would usually get diagnosed and treated for. Every time I speak to him about getting properly diagnosed and potentially considering medication, he blocks and says that everyone, including me, gets down from time to time, so why should he be any different. 
Based on his phases, our marriage is currently in danger because I have come to a point where I am simply exhausted to go through these crises every year. Fully knowing that every beautiful episode is followed by the same horribly painful pattern. So my question is, what can I possibly do to enable his understanding and willingness to explore further options before this illness that he does not want to accept because he sees it as stigma will ruin our otherwise beautiful relationship? I know the psychologist visits are great but they are not sufficient. At the moment, we are getting into a better period again but I have lost all trust in this relationship staying better and not drifting off into the next crisis again in a few months time. 
What can I do to support him to embrace the thought rather than pushing him and hence making him want to move further from it? I feel without him going and acknowledging that he may be ill and he may need medication to support the psychology, our marriage will not survive because I cannot stay in this painful situation. To me, it is so clearly visible what is going on but he just cannot or does not want to see it. I would hate to end this relationship as we have a lot of love for one another. I don't want the end be based on an illness. Can you help?

Dear Someone,
I am in recovery from anxiety and depression and my wings are broken. I often feel so overwhelmed that I feel numb. Maybe I’ve cried too much or maybe I’m still in disbelief. I have just come home from rehab and just when you think you’ve reached rock bottom you fall a bit more. I know recovery is a long term journey. I am at the very bottom and I need support. I found out my partner had been seeing another person while I was away. I can’t even explain the pain, anger and shame I’m feeling. I can’t help but blame my own inability to control my anxiety and depression as reason to deserve this. Maybe my self esteem is that broken. Some days I can’t get out of bed and face people because everyone expects me to be “better” now I’ve been to rehab. I have my phone permanently on do not disturb because I don’t want to talk to people. How do I fix my wings?

This is my first thread. I guess I'm just feeling like crap, because pretty much everyone I know ignores me. Not that I'd talk to them about the way I feel anyway, because it seems like they wouldn't care if I did.
Don't get me wrong, I don't sit there and prod people to feel sorry for me or anything. This is when I make general conversation. I'm pretty sure I haven't done anything that could justify people treating me like I don't exist.   
 So I have this friend that I used to be really close to. We're both female. I met her in high school and she's my best friend, although considering the way she treats me, I don’t know why I call her that. We were really close in highschool, closer then I was with my own sister.
She had a bad homelife or atleast that's what I gathered. She was always very secretive. Anyway, she basically lived at my house at some points.
It was always a strange friendship. It was like I was always trying to gain her approval and I was like her lapdog or something. I'd do anything for her, try to protect her. I loved her so much, I just wanted her to be happy.
She could be mean sometimes, insulting me in front of other people. Hell, she kicked me in the shin in front of a bunch of people once. Wow, you're thinking, why would you ever want to be near someone like that? It's hard to explain but she was really charming and intelligent as well. She made me feel loved but also like I was a walking piece of human excrement at the same time. It was weird.
Over the years though we drifted appart from time to time, as you do. I got a girlfriend. Other then that though neither of our lives advanced much. She would also do this thing were she would just completely drop off the face of the earth and no one would hear from her for, damn, years even.
We've been in contact allot more the last few years, usually because I push and push until she starts talking to me again. It also tends to be when she needs something, or I'll coax her by offering to share.
Anyway, its gotten to the point where she's blatantly ignoring me again. My sister is also ignoring me, which is less usual.  Although we don't talk much in general and she's a pretty busy person. Although, she seems to have time to post stupid things on Facebook apparently.
I feel like crap. These people that I love don't even care enough to reply to a message. They don't even try to hide it. It's like they want me to know I mean nothing to them. Or they just don't care if I know...

I finished a course in health with flying colours, but then when I started the clinical placements for the course, I very quickly realised the work wasn't for me, after wasting 12 weeks doing the study. Just another thing that I have failed at.
I have no idea of what I want to do with my life professionally anymore and live with my elderly parents because I can't afford to live on my own, I have never been in a relationship as I am gay and not out.
Everyone around me is kicking goals, living the prime of their lives and I just stay where I am treading water without a penny to my name.
While I am not suicidal, I really am beginning to wonder what the point of living is. It's just the same cycle of getting up each morning to another day of sadness.
Everyone around me is kicking goals, and living the prime of their lives while I am going no where.

If my loved ones were feeling so lost, overwhelmed and numb, I would hate to think they couldn't reach out to me! Yet life is TOUGH! I'm so overwhelmed that even trying to cook a stirfry (our quick and easy meal) paralyses me. I feel I can't reach out as I barely have the energy to write initially, let alone respond.
How do you ask your loved ones for help? How do you move past your paralyzing moments?

I have never been diagnosed with depression, but the older i get the worse i seem to fear everything - (im 33 for reference)
i can't socialise properly, im scared of people.  im terribly confused about what to do with my life because im too afraid to take the plunge into something new- i can't stand up for myself in conflicted situations and always give in to keep the peace. I basically hate who i have become. My home life is unsettling. where do i go from here.

Hey everyone, 
This is my first time posting and I'm just asking for some advice. I left my job a little over 12 months ago, to begin a new one with a relative in their business. I thought it would be great because it's closer to home and I was promised the flexibility as I was studying towards a degree at the time. It being a new business, it was a struggle to get it off the ground and I really struggled in that first year with being burnt out that has gradually made feelings of depression creep up on me. The job itself is very high pressure and I have been battling severe work stress for atleast a year now. 
I have never struggled with any feelings of depression before beginning this job, although I do struggle with social anxiety. I thought it would be easier for me this year as more people were hired to help me, but I find it isn't the case.
I have been trying to sway my thoughts to the positive but it isn't working. I find myself always saying to myself that I have to just through one more day, and one more day and so on... I go to bed with anxiety about having to go to work the next day, and then wake up with anxiety about having to go to. I feel like I would rather do anything but this job. It's just not for me. 
I don't know what to do as I live out ofhome and have a lot of expenses that my partner cannot managed on his own and it being a relatives business I'm worried about letting them down by leaving. I feel like I am trapped which isn't making it any easier. I don't know what to do anymore...

I have lately been through some pretty traumatic stuff and i have not been myself, all my parents see is an ungrateful spoilt child who gets everything she wants so im apparently not entitled to feel emotion. With this in mind, i feel disconnected from my life as though im here physically but not mentally and its scaring the crap out of me. Why do i feel completely and utterly alone all the time? or why do i feel so disconnected from the world?

So last year I had depression really bad and used these forums for support when I needed it and they really helped. I wanted and probably should of continued to post on the forums but life got to busy and I couldn’t find the time. Anyway I feel like I’m depressed again and I don’t know what to do. I have a beautiful girlfriend, gorgeous puppy and good friends but I am working a job that is distroying me. I work at a camel dairy and was pretty much made assistant manager after a month of being there. I enjoy trianing and working with the camels but the hours aren’t great and I feel the camels aren’t getting the right care they need it the training that they need. My girlfriend works there as well and really doesn’t enjoy it either. Things are slowly getting worse with the camels and seeing them in pain and stressed is slowly killing me inside. I feel like I should be happy as my bosses are nice they just don’t really know what they are doing and I have an alright life at home. Becuase of the hours I’m working I don’t have time for my animals at home or any of my hobby’s or study and when I am home all I want to do is sleep. I’ve been offered a few jobs now and want to take them I just have no idea how to go about it and quit. I feel like I’m slipping mentally more and more everyday and I don’t want to get back to where I was last year, I don’t know what to do anymore.

People say these magic words.. It's not her fault she was ""depressed"" and I didn't know what I was doing... 
I know that I was doing things to feel alive. I know that I was having massive highs and lows. I just didn't show anyone. 
Seen but not heard.
Smile but be unhappy. 
Laugh without knowing why. 
cry because I'm happy. LOL get that one.. freakin crazy!
Argue to distract. 
Hide to feel safe. 
Don't talk to family.
Have no friend only acquaintances.
Love without feeling.
I'm trying to stay positive now. and trying to find the right Dr to treat me. I've seen a few now and I find myself just telling them what they want to hear. I don't know why I do it. I've lied for so many years I can't be open to anyone. 
My husband has also turned around and said quit a few time, I don't know who you are, he thought he know me but now he feels he never did. But the bad thing is he has realized that i know him better than he thought. 
I play with peoples heads. Give them what they want to hear and I change my personality to suit every occasion. I scare myself with how good I'm at manipulating situations, I'm the chameleon. But also can be a social butterfly. 
What I need to do is STOP! Stop being someone, everyone else wants me to be and be myself. Problem... Who it that! 
And when I start thinking me, I hate myself.
I do stupid things to remind myself that I'm worthless. That's what I will always be a disappointment, a waste of space. Hurtful to the ones I love the most. 
WOW the list goes on and on.. 
I'm ashamed of my past, and I'm never going to forgive myself for what I've done.
How can one heal, if they know the person standing in the mirror is everything you despise in a person.
How can one stay in the life they have, knowing that they will be trapped in a mind of a hateful person.

So, at the start of Janurary 2018 I started feeling terrible.
I got a massive brain fog, couldn't concentrate and at sometimes felt like I couldn't see.
The range of things I've felt from Janurary to now is almost uncountable.
Its effecting my job as I can't go to work without having a panic attack.
In march all the brain fog and lightheadness went away. I finally started feeling normal again. In fact even now I feel normal.
However I have this overall Numb feeling. Its not like my skins numb or my minds numb, It just feels down to the core that I'm Numb. Like my soul is numb or gone. I just feel empty. When ever I notice this my anxiety skyrockets and sends me straight into a panic attack. (Even writing this is spinning me into a panic attack) The numb never settles or goes away. Is this depression or am I dying?
If I'm in my room alone I notice the numbness fairly often and feel uptight, however when I go to work (I work in a pub) as soon as the counter starts getting full I find myself going completely numb from my head to my toes and start falling into things in order to grab onto reality. I often end up sitting outside then getting sent home early due to my inability to work. The panic attacks end pretty quickly (A minute tops per attack) however I go into insane panic drive and throw myself around i.e running to the bathroom to suck water out of the tap or falling into things.
I've been prescribed meds  however I'm too scared to take the pills. I get panicky thinking about taking them.
This numbness is overall ruining my quality of life, I don't feel like I'm here. I'm just kind of walking through life watching. I'm not suicidal however I am very worried about my wellbeing incase this isn't depression. I've been to several doctors all my results have come back fine. No history of family diease.
My hands tremble from time to time if I'm feeling real anxious (Which is all the time) and it causes me to panic more about what if I'm dying.
I'm coming here in order to try to find some common ground. because when I google this numb feeling or try to tell someone about it they all reroute it back to ""Oh is it like emotional numbness?"" But Its not emotional numbness, well I don't think anyway. I just feel like my body isn't my own and I panic as soon as I notice it. Should I start taking the medication? I've been to a therapist and it didn't help. I've always been very anxious but I've never felt like this.
This is literally ruining my life.

I am recently single from a long term relationship and want to know if their is anyway to deal with this lonely feeling and actual enjoy being single? I don't believe that i will ever get in another relationship again as i have no confidence and can not speak to females. So with that in mind, are there any methods in dealing with loneliness and not wanting a relationship so bad? Because that is all i want and it is the main cause of my depression! Thanks

Hey, I'm Ben. 
I'm not really sure what brought me to signing up an account here today, but I know that posting anything personal on FB, Instagram or any other social media is viewed as attention seeking so I avoid doing that. What I really need is just somewhere to get my thoughts out without having to pay for an anonymous blog site that no one will see anyway. Depressive thoughts aren't exactly a niche topic that people would pay to read I wouldn't think.
Anyway, I'm 38. I have a stable job in the public service and 2 excellent cats that are the reason I look forward to going home to. Way better than being alone. It hasn't always been like that, back in 2010 I realised a dream of becoming a business owner and barely 3 years later that dream failed. I made excuses as to why. Bad timing, wrong business, wrong area, but all it really was in the end was my ego thinking I could just ""make it work"" because that's how I always did things. Just start and figure it out along the way. I'm still paying off the $100k debt, struggled for a year or so with some on and off again labouring work before getting my PS job back mid 2014 but I'm back on track financially.
I had become used to being on my own for the last 20 years after a succession of failed attempts at finding someone special because I ended up just being a place warmer until they found someone better. That's not an exaggeration either. Every. Single. Time someone better came along for them. So told myself I'm better off alone, which I feel is true. I swore I'd never let anyone get close to me again but towards the end of 2016 someone came into my life and was relentless in her friendship building. We became fast friends and recently met Australia Day long weekend. I swore I wouldn't fall for her but we had been talking daily for over a year and I begged myself to keep seeing her as a friend. Though on more than one occasion we would say that we are pretty perfect for each other. We match and just clicked. it was inevitable to feel like this...
She had become very quiet after about 2 months ago after meeting her, I put it down to her work load after taking herself back to Uni. Then last night I found out that someone new came into her life and I have become unnecessary. That was the reason why I barely hear from her at all, at best I get a few words in a reply. I always find out the hard way instead of just being told about it
I'm over this. Soon I'll be 40 and alone. This is my life and thanks for reading.

lately i have been very depressed. this is my 3rd depression relapse, though i dont feel comfortable going to see a psychologist, hence why i am posting this. its not me refusing to help myself; im just too scared to truly open up.
my friends, family and teachers have noticed a change in me and they keep asking me if im okay, to which i just tell them that im fine, even if i am visibly and quite obviously not. this is because my best friend gets angry when i cry and will start ignoring me and talking to other people.  i dont want my friends to think my depression is me seeking attention, and i feel as though they really dont care and i am burdening them with my issues. i also dont want to upset my mum, as when i had my first depressive episode it seemed to take a toll on her, and i dont want her to suffer because of me. due to all of this i suffer in silence. 
i have absolutely no motivation to do anything. i have stayed in my bed for almost 2 weeks and i havent showered or changed my clothes for 5 days. i have school work and other things i know i need to do but the motivation is absolutely not there. 
i dont really like to talk about my problems and when people bring them up i just joke about it and then say im okay and you dont need to worry about it, but im really not okay. im not sure what to do at this point.

Hi there 
just wondering if in the last 3-4 or even longer if my high and positive live style is just part of a bipolar high . 
I lived depression free till about 43 then depression slowly crept in firstly not to bad but in the last year and a half I had two mayor breakdown allways combined with a relationship breakup after depression kicked in - 
just wanna describe before I met those two woman I was really feeling great . I just describe what I been doing 
healthy eating 
surfing a priority( getting up early and using the day ) 
learning a instrument 
meeting new people 
good sexdrive 
took my bike to the desert ( 
when i ride my bike I don’t concentrate on any negative as I think it attracts the accident 
going bymyself on holiday and being adventurous 
buying nice things 
Working on my car 
getting into bed and can’t wait to start a new day - 
doing little projects 
living in the now not thinking about the future to much 
at work offshore I take day by day and don’t concentrate on the day I leave 
make the best out even if the work is crap 
i do Talk  a lot , allways have - but not rapid 
just enjoyed the beautiful ocean and the hobby I do in under and on it 
being busy so there is no time for thinking 
when I start a relationship Iam always full on , think very much all possible into the future to quick - then depression comes and I get needy and the over 
sure i wasn’t like that all the the time but a lot and always before I meet anyone as that strong personality is attractive. 
 
Anyway now Iam worried my highs are unatural ? But I always kind of lived that way not thinking to much of the future and enjoying live , 
Now i worried that that is all just a part of bipolar bipolar????? Confused as I always been like that just without the depression part ...... that s just active since the last 3 years and I think I know what caused it (( working fifo , loneliness, not connected with peoples, no friends, no family, daughter growing up , isolation, midlife crises , no purpose , not being needed) 
so are my positive feelings normal or just a up ??? Confused 
a lot

Hi hope you're all doing well!
I moved to a new place about 6 months ago and I feel as if I'm starting to sink. I feel like I'm losing myself and I just don't have anyone around who I can talk to. I feel completely hopeless and I don't why I just can't cope with these things like other people do and just move forward with my life.
I was living with my parents before I moved here but I'm getting used to not having them around - this has made me feel more alone than ever and it's an awful feeling. I was just wondering, does anyone know any ideas to meet people around you especially when you're feeling so horrible? I feel like I'm not the life of the party right now and I don't even know if I can speak to people anymore and have a normal conversation! I was so hopeful when I moved up here that things would be better but it's been so awful as I've just been so stuck in my head and almost scared of what's out there.. If anyone can provide some advice that would be so great!

Speaking from experience, if your depression has an obvious cycle to you, timing of your motivation could be in vain. It could be counter-productive when you don't reach your basic goals of fitness. Ever done some jogging when depressed and fallen into an emotional heap?
 
Often we read in these pages sufferers that try everything known to man in motivating themselves while in a mental down time. But isn’t this a similar concept to that old and common saying “just snap out of it”? We cant just do that, we know that, then why would we try the same in a physical sense?
 
Accepting our illness is essential as the thread talks about (google) “Topic: Acceptance- is this our biggest challenge- beyondblue” and motivation is another step we need to gather an inner strength, as part of our good management. How do we do this.?
 
Recent studies suggest that that annoying depressive cycle when it arrives is best left to run its course however long that might take. So fighting it is a waste of time. Going for a walk might well help but not intense exercise thinking you'll break that cycle. Considering this revelation, motivation strategies are best placed on hold.
 
My wife and I go to the gym 3 times a week for over 45 minutes of intense training. I was 131kg 9 months ago and unfit with a poor diet. We’d arrive and hop on the treadmill for minimum 20 minutes. This time period I was told allows the heart to get fit. Any less time and it’s a waste of effort as the blood pressure drops then rises again before 20 minutes, thus its good cardio training. Then weights for the rest of the time. However, several times I’ve arrived to get on the treadmill and only lasted 2-3 minutes. My mind was depressed maybe stressed…it has to be clear and content to do that machine. I think this is a reflection of what I’m talking about.
 
When we attend the gym and I’m not depressed at all, I accelerate my training, stay for over an hour and really put in. Furthermore I’m capable of lowering my food intake and eat healthier foods. I've lost 9kg. Based on this, it could be advisable to commit yourself more to your motivation regime when not depressed. Whatever you choose in terms of exercise, it is well known that physical exercise, like adequate sleep and relaxation is essential to the well being of the sufferer of the black dog.
 
Cant motivate yourself? Relax, do some muscle tensioning exercises and don't worry. Wait for that cycle to go by then run like the wind…

Hey Guys,
First and foremost i'm really grateful there's a forum like this I can goto to get advice. I am 99% sure my partner has depressions. A few weeks ago she came home from an engagement drunk, broke down and wanted to leave me because we have no future - she said she didn't want to be here anymore, didn't want to live and life would not get any better. She had tried to break up with me 2 times prior. Once in september last year after a small argument about how she's overwork and shouldn't stay back all the time and once again mid January - which was COMPLETELY out of the blue. 
Some background one her. 

She's turning 32, was in a long term relationship and her partner cheated on her. She was singler for many years before we started dating.
After her breakup a close family member commit suicide. She felt guilty that she didn't help before it was too late.
Best friend and 'rock' moved overseas. 
She hates her job. 11 hour days are common. She's been trying to find a new job but has been getting rejected. 2 years of job applications, working late and taking work home. She had 6 month contract role / promotion but had to go back to her current job. Very stressed.
She severely injured her back 2 years ago. Eroded disc. Needs surgery. Constant pain. Manages it with opioids. Was on the list for a year. Got called up September 17, they gave it away. Was called up March 18 - was suppose to go yesterday but they postponed it due to emergency. 
Since her injury and work situation has gotten worse, i've noticed her get worse. Her friend came back to visit, but left after a week which may have made it worse. She very much feels like her friends no longer do anything and the 'fun' part is over.

She has told me she no longer loves me. Each time this happens it correlates with other negative things happening. It feels like she bottles everything up and feels like she needs to change something immediately - and i'm the only thing she has control over.  Most recently she wanted to break up was after she found out her surgery was postponed (Saturday). In my mind, it's clear she just has a hard time seeing the good in anything - and i'm her emotional punching bag. 
Do i leave her? I love her to death, she's a beautiful person who at the moment just seems beaten down. Do i accept she doesn't love me anymore and give up? Any advice would be good. We currently live together (for 2 years) and have been together for almost 3. 
Thanks in advance.

Hi all,
First time poster, long term supporter of Beyond Blue.
I am a 29 year old living in a unit with my dog. I have a part time job and I study full time. I have a wonderful family and lovely friends. From the outside, life is seemingly wonderful; but for some reason, I find myself sitting on my couch in the dark each night feeling like I am the only person in existence.  I feel as though everyone else is busy living their lives, while I sit back and watch as an observer rather than participating in life.
I have battled with anxiety for my entire life and have spent time in hospital. I recall as a child (as young as 4), when my mum would work night shift, I would sit at my window and wait for her car to pull up in the driveway. Each time a car passed my home that wasn't my mum's, I would panic and think something had happened to her. I constantly worry about how I will survive without my mum and dad when they pass. I think this is because they are the only two people whom I have an actual connection with. This worry keeps me up most nights. I see a psychologist fortnightly but don't seem to be getting anywhere. She makes comments such as ""you have a very, very complex mind"" and ""you are craving love and acceptance, but as soon as someone comes close to you, you shut them out"". 
I often feel pathetic and ungrateful because I am well aware that there are wonderful people out there who are living a life a lot more difficult then mine.  What is wrong with me? I really have nothing to be sad about. 
Does this empty feeling ever pass? Will my impending sense of doom ever fade? I don't want to feel like this anymore.

Hi
My mum has been clinically depressed for about the last ten years, however over the last couple of years, and months especially, it has just seemed to become worse and worse. I used to be very close to my mum, but now I find it difficult to hold a conversation with her for longer than 5 minutes without needing to walk away. She used to have so much interest in my life and what I was doing, but now it's almost as though she doesn't really care too much, and is more interested in the things I've done wrong than right. The house doesn't feel like a happy place anymore and because of that I'm working as much as I can to avoid being here and dealing with the tension. I have anxiety myself and so it's very difficult for me to be calm and happy in my own home when there are people yelling at each other and constant tension, especially when my mum doesn't really acknowledge that anxiety is a real thing, but that's another issue in itself. I would say that I am the most understanding out of the other members of the family that live at home, as I've done research and have probably spoken to my mum about what she feels more than anyone, but I'm really struggling at the moment to cope with it all. She is constantly on a short fuse and the smallest thing can lead to a massive argument. It's been a while since I've had a conversation with her and not come out of it feeling stupid and worse about myself, and I'm just not sure what to do. I don't want to upset her because I don't think she would take hearing any of this too well,but it's having a significant effect on my own mental and physical health, and it has been doing so for the last four months. She does occasionally see a psychologist and is taking medication, and I've also tried to make sure that she knows I'm available to talk anytime, but it only seems to be getting worse andI don't know what to do. Sorry if none of this makes any sense, but I would really appreciate any advice. Thanks

Thank you for reading.
I am 7 days sober and struggling mostly with guilt and self forgiveness. I have been an alcoholic for 8 years and during this time I did have sober periods but these were short lived.
I am struggling to cope with the shame and guilt I feel toward myself and my alcoholism.  I have had poor judgement, made bad decisions and put myself in situations that made me extremely vulnerable because I was ""blind drunk"".  How can I forgive myself?  I fear that if I cannot find a way to forgive myself, I will drink to escape what I have done and who I have become.
I would really appreciate hearing from others who have struggled with self forgiveness.  I would be especially grateful if you could share with me exactly how you were able to forgive yourself and move forward with your life.
Thank you again for reading.

I'm really struggling to keep on top of my depression lately. I'm fighting it so hard but circumstances keep overwhelming me. I'm very prone to situational depression since my 20s but I've managed to stay on top of things and nip things in the bud. I still get bouts of it but never as bad as it was in my 20s. I pride myself in that I keep on top of things. However, my life is feeling more and more isolated and stressful lately and I can't seem to find a balance to keep that depression dog in check. I can feel it..  making my throat sore, making me cry all the time, be bad tempered and angry at life. How do I get control of this thing?
I'm a single parent to three children and one of them is special needs - this child is having massive problems at school and is autistic so sometimes violent and sent home. My children are all still pretty young (all under 10) and my ex husband committed suicide 2 years ago (something I'm still dealing with and I still have some post-traumatic stress over).
 I only work part time. I love my job as it is something I enjoy and gives me some social interaction but other than my job I can't go out because my my special needs child who cannot cope. My mother helps as much as she can but I'm pretty isolated and I know this is one of the problems. I have no partner and my friends all work full time so I'm on my own a lot which is really bad of depression I know. I try to keep myself really busy and focus on positive things but I think the stress of my situation is getting me down. I get on top of things then it's like a balancing act because something will go wrong with my special needs child and I have all these appointments to take them to - it's so overwhelming and it's all down to me. 
 My friends are supportive and I've told them I've been blue lately and they were concerned and said to ring them when I felt like that but I can't/don't want to bring them down and moan plus they're so busy all the time with their own lifes and work.. what to do?

have you ever felt so physically dead on the inside that you convince yourself you truly did die when everything went wrong. 
i cant do anything without being unenthusiastic all i wanna do is sleep and cry i hate this feeling and my anxiety also gets the better of me i used to love hanging out with groups of new people and going to parties but now id rather sleep and eat .its so hard to function or be scared or feel actual emotion .this guy was head over heals with me for around two years and he could deal with me when no one could but i broke his heart over and over again and i felt no feeling towards him.my mother passed away when i was 12 i am currently 16 ,i wasn't very close with her i always felt like she planned my life to be hell , my mother had  depression ,schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . she had 3 children to 3 different and only knew 1 of their names my mother was an alcoholic and a drug addict i got ripped out of her arms as soon i was born and i was put into a foster care where the lady who was my foster mother used to cry and cry because her youngest son had died and she only had him so she needed someone to fill the gap ,docs didn't think i had any family so they tried their hardest to find a relative and thats when they found my grandmother and grandfather they have raised me all my life and every family member i know has no news on my dad . my mother died from cancer and she was so loving towards me but i stood my arrogant ground i couldn't even say i love you .when she was in a coma the night before she died everyone sung the song she sang to us ""you are my sunshine"". everyone gave her kisses and individually wen tin their and and talked to her but i almost passed out in the bathroom i couldn't talk to her .i missed my chance that was the last time anyone ever saw her again.i felt so dark and so empty at age twelve the next day i went to school and acted normal no one asked me if i was okay and every time im now sad everyone thinks its that and i hate when people think they know how i feel but they dont .im sick of feeling like i have no one to turn to i just want to be able to accomplish my goals and get better.

My troubles all came to the surface at the end of last year. Working in a job and being treated unfairly and bullied so relentlessly that one day my mind just snapped and I had a breakdown. I had worked so hard for 10 years and felt like at the end, I got nothing out of it but misery and a diagnosis of major depression (this was not the only factor that caused my diagnosis).
So I was put on antidepressants, first time for me and I gave up my job and decided to embark on a new career and at 34 that’s not easy. But I did it, I took up study and began looking for part time work.......
I got an interview after applying for 61 jobs..... (no joke) I did really well and was sent last week for a medical, at the medical there was a form it asked me what drugs I’m taking? Being an honest soul I told them about the antidepressants. I was at the end of the medical taken to see the doctor, who told me I was considered unfit for duty....... I now have to get a doctors report to and I’m quote the doctor here “ say that I’m not going to go crazy wile in the job and cause a major incident”.
I decided that day that I was no longer taking my antidepressants, I feel like I have been singled out because I have to take these damned things and as a man I feel weak and that I have no control in my life. 
Currently I’m on day 4 no meds and the side effects are killing me it feels like my brain is getting electric shocks and I can barely get up. I’m angry all the time and just sit in my room listening to music and avoiding my family. I just hope that I can get myself sorted out in time for my next job interview.
 Anyone else gone through something similar?

I feel like I always want to be left alone and I feel like screaming whenever anyone wants to engage in inane chatter or small talk. In a social environment I am always aware of other people and what they are feeling and simultaneously I'm always fearing their judgement and hoping they haven't noticed that Ive put on weight or noticed I've said something stupid. I come across as friendly and funny and kind. I care about other people and feel best when those around me are happy and content but if theyre not, I soak up all their negativity and it drains me emotionally. When I'm alone, I'm free of all these stresses and can read books, create art, engage in a thought provoking TV series or enjoy a wonderful meal. It is peaceful and I am happy. In our society however this is considered wrong and weird. Plus I'm a Mother and help my brother, ex partner and best friend look after their children so I am constantly asked to help and very rarely alone. Today I just feel like crying and running away. Am I suffering from some type of emotional disorder?

As a thought experiment let's assume that we all have a goal seeking machine at our disposal. Let's assume that our brain is fundamentally a goal seeking machine.  Now Let's put that hypothesis to a test.  Let's take a brand new brain, one that has not been cluttered by any information at all, good or bad, a human baby.  Well, almost no bad if we ignore the first encounter with other humans is to have your bottom smacked to make you cry because they love you.

After that ridiculous encounter you calm down and start looking for food. Some people have called this instinct but this is as misguided as slapping your bottom.  You goal is to get something to eat and is duly provided by someone who really loves you, your mother.

Next, sometime later, you find yourself laying on your back in a crib with an interesting multicoloured mobile dangling over your head. You don't know what this perverse thing is so you decide to see what it feels like. But that's not as easy as you think.  Your arms wave around, your fingers grasp at the air.  You have no concept of the vast multitude of muscles to achieve your goal, you need help.  Over time something in your brain, by trial and error, guides your hand and fingers to what you want.  You have achieved your first goal.  Well, second if you don't ignore your first one. with your mother, but that usually only happens when you are a teenager.

After that ordeal, you learn to use that technique to achieve goal after goal. As time passes you want more and different things. And that something inside your brain always finds a way to get it for you, using whatever means you know of, sometimes using very inventive methods you aren't really sure where they came from.

Now you have grown up and had many many life experiences and have gained a vast storehouse of knowledge. It was gained in every way that it's possible to gain knowledge. Much of it you don't consciously remember and a lot that you can't put into words, like how to ride a bicycle, but it's there nevertheless.  It has a name it's called tacit knowledge.

It is that tacit knowledge you will draw from for your self help. You only need a goal to bring it out.  It's always worked in the past. Any ideas?

Hello,
I am going to be honest, it's taking every ounce of courage I can muster to write this.. and even more probably to hit the post button.
I was diagnosed with depression/anxiety in my early teens and over the course of the years I've tried to manage it with a combination of talking therapy with various psychologists and more recently with anti-depression medication. A few years ago I was also diagnosed with the early stages of Multiple Sclerosis. Fortunately it has not impacted on my life too much and the prognosis of it ever doing so is relatively low, especially with the recent developments in treatments. To put my situation into greater context, I am hitting my mid 30's,  whilst I ma married I have not achieved certain milestones expected by this age. I am struggling with my identity - who I am versus the mask I wear to hide the depression. 
However, the reason I am reaching out is because I am finding my old methods of coping when I feel that ""black dog"" of depression beginning to get the better of me are no longer working. 
I know logically I am not alone, that I am allowed to feel this way and allowed to ask for help... but we all know how it can convince you otherwise. I am trying to fight back, trying to believe I am not alone. I am posting this partly to prove to myself it doesn't control or define me and partly because I hope there are other people out there who can offer some advice. 

I need new coping methods to fend off the dark days. Does anyone have any strategies they use that work well? I used to write or play video games but I feel so tired, blocked and disinterested that these doesn't seem to help me anymore.

       And

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can help my husband, who is amazingly supportive, but need advice on how he's meant to 'help me, help myself'. I feel terrible because he feels so lost when I begin to shut down. I have no suggestions on what he can do because if I knew what to do, I'd be doing it myself (I do hope that makes sense). We share our thoughts and feelings a lot but he'd like to know if there is anything else he could do to help me more forward and past the down days/cycles.

Thank you to anyone who has spent the time reading this. 
I appreciate it more then you know.

Hi,
I was diagnosed with depression around this time last year and spent most of 2017 in therapy. I made some great strides and found my lows became less low and I was having more highs, which I hadn't realised were missing so much from my life (I was diagnosed last year but probably should have been many years before that).
I had a very long run of, as I've taken to calling them, good brain days where I've been on top of things and the occasional feelings of worthlessness or despair have been easily controlled. However, the past few weeks, without anything really changing in my life, I've found myself back in the hole I had climbed out of.
I am that annoyingly familiar case of someone whose life is going well but still finds themselves crippled by depression. I'm happy in my marriage and my home life. My job is boring sometimes and interesting other times like most jobs and my hobby of writing is going well. I've won some competitions and joined a writer's group who reacted really well to me and my work. I have a novel written that's currently being manuscript assessed, which is admittedly adding to my stress as I wait for the report to come back so I can edit the book and try and get it published. But that stress is a good stress in the sense that I'm moving closer to a finish line.
I haven't posted on here before but I thought that it might help me to see if anyone had any coping strategies for when those dark feelings hit and it feels like a weight has fallen on them that they can't lift off. I probably need to go back to my therapist but I find that his area tends to be talking about things rather than giving me strategies and I like the talking but I don't like the feeling awful afterwards without the weapons to fight off the feeling terrible.
Any help anyone can offer would be much appreciated, and just to know that there are people out there who might read this and know what its like is reassuring. When you're fighting something this big it's nice to know there are other people who might know how to find its weaknesses.
Thanks,
Sean.

It’s been a while since I’ve had an episode of depression. This latest one has been a doozy.
Ive been seeing my psychologist about my depression and anxiety all year so far and I mentioned something to her today which I wondered “does anyone else feel this way?”.
 
What I have noticed is that after I have been depressed for some time, crying constantly, being really on edge and touchy, there comes a point where I don’t feel anything. It might just be for a day.
When I feel this way I almost miss being depressed, because the feeling of crying is cathartic. It’s comforting and I know it. It’s a release for what goes on in my head. 
 But not feeling, not crying feels strange and in that moment I miss being depressed. 
This seems to happen every time I have an episode st some point or another.
Does this happen to anyone else?

Hi! 
This is my first thread - Im not really sure how it works and Im not really sure I know what I want to say. I am lonely and scared - Ive always surrounded myself with high achievers and in the past, that made me grow and better myself but now, it just drowns me.
I advocate for mental health and looking out for friends and family who are down but when it comes to myself I have no compassion. I cannot love myself - I feel broken and betrayed by myself. I feel like a failure - when one thing goes right, 20 things go wrong for me. Logically, I know my life is still pretty good despite my condition - I shouldnt be like this but I am and that makes me feel worse. 
My family don't understand how I am feeling and just tell me to get over it - every else has. But now I am on anti-depressants and can't control my emotions or motivation and I cannot tell my family. I have to lie about my expenses to see psychological help and get medication and I feel so separated from them, so separated from my high achieving friends who keep progressing with their amazing lives while im stuck here.
The whole world is flying by me and Im just stuck here.

Hi, I’m new here and I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar for about 6 months now although I was incorrectly diagnosed with major despressive disorder for the last 5 years. I also suffer from really bad social anxiety. I’m a 19 year old female and I struggle every day with bipolar even though I’m on 3 different types of medication to help get it under control. I can’t hold a job due to my mania being too intense and my depression being too bad so money is a serious problem for me. I was on Centrelink for study but I couldn’t continue studying because my brain is so dead I can’t stay focused on anything and it’s really hard for me to process information. The only time I leave my house is for doctor appointments and to see my psychologist. The only financial support I have is my mum and my boyfriend which they insist is fine but it makes me feel so helpless. I’ve got very few friends since finishing school and none of them know about my mental state. I feel like I need to get a job or study like everyone else my age (which my extended family members have rudely pointed out) but with my unstable moods and extreme anxiety about leaving my house, this feels practically impossible. I feel trapped inside my head all day every day. I wish I could see my psychologist more often but with my money issues, I can only see her once a month if I’m lucky because of my mental health plan. I’ve already tried going to my local mental health unit but the only thing the “psychiatrist” told me was to lose weight (I’m slightly overweight due to being on so much medication) and make more friends. I’m not confident in the public mental health unit anymore since hearing that. I was made to feel like this is all my fault and maybe I should just get over it which is physically impossible. I try to act as okay as I can around my mum as she’s already stressed enough about her work and the rest of my brothers. I have 0 confidence and self esteem even though I’m trying to improve my body positivity through exercising every day but losing weight isn’t going to help what’s going on in my head and I fear I’ve also developed an addiction for exercise and I’m very conscious about what I eat and how many calories I consume in a day. I’m really struggling with myself mentally and physically and I feel my life lacks so much substance but I’m so mentally tired all the time and it’s just so hard to try and stay positive. I’m constantly in a dull state and I really don’t know who to turn to anymore.

I’ve been suffering from clinical depression for a while now, but only recently diagnosed. The mental health nurse I had been seeing since I was 15 for things like anxiety and anger. I miss those days — At least I actually felt something. In the last few months my mental health nurse had packed up and moved. I had only just started learning how to manage my depression with the aid of my MH nurss and was prescribed medication.
I live in a rural area and allied health was a luxury which has now been taken away with nothing to compensate. I’ve been left alone to deal with this empty pit in my stomach that I was not ready to deal with alone again.
I’ve explored other avenues, I kept at my medication until it ran out, but I felt no different on or off it. I refuse to go see my GP without allied health but find it impossible for me to unload 5 years worth of therapy on to someone new. I’ve tried getting high, which just left me feeling the same. To make a long story short, the only thing that has worked for me is sex. Or anything sexual.
It’s only a brief feeling but when I have sex I actually feel something. Even if it’s regret, anger, sadness, happiness, whichever... It’s something. I’ve only recently lost my virginity September last year but find myself thinking about it all the time; wanting it all the time. For the record I don’t sleep with anyone willy nilly. I like to pick and choose who it’s with, I like the romance. Nothing more. I don’t care for the men I’m with and none of them care for me I hope.
I feel like I’ve sunken myself into a pattern that I don’t particularly care for but I’m not in a rush to get out of. I’m still lonely and I still feel numb every other hour of the day. I don’t really know if I’m asking for advice or looking for affirmation or whatever, I think I’m just speaking out loud.

Hi Beyond Blue Forums,
I've been feeling rather down and very much unwanted by the people in my life. I feel like I'm always second-rate, used and will never ever be good enough for anyone. My friends and family are all very talented, high achievers and aim for good careers and a solid future. Me on the other hand, I'm always supporting my friends dreams, encouraging them to take chances and feeling happy for them. I try my best to work hard and do well, hoping that one day I'll be able to shine and stand next to them. But I realised, no matter how much I try, how much time and effort I put in- I'll never be good enough for anything, I'll never be able to succeed and I'm just not going to have a future.
My parents at home are supportive of me, but they don't see the whole picture. They kind of feel that if I'm well fed and have a roof over my head, then I'll be happy. I'm also limited to how much emotion I can show in my household. Since my family has always been very large and happy - with no one ever having a history of mental/emotional issues, they don't really understand how to deal with someone been upset or going through a phase of emotional breakdowns. 
Overall I just don't feel very wanted. I feel that my friends kind of have me there just for the support. They'll use me once and then kind of  throw me away. I'm always second-rate in everything, I'll never stand out and I kind of accepted that I will never be special to anyone. I always feel isolated from this world, tired and really just want to give up.

As it's well known, Australia has intense heatwaves. In recent years, the summers had gotten hotter (global warming?) and the Bureau of Meteorology said that heatwaves could cause mental illness.
I agree with this. Any thoughts?

It is understandable that those with mental illness are more moody. An extreme of this is bipolar. Moods are an inherent part of day to day life...such is why mood stabilizer medication is usually prescribed.
Along with such medication, bipolar or not, we should seek a bundle of remedies to approach our illness. Just like relaxation is good for anxiety and therapy good for BPD sufferers, a multi pronged approach is the best way.
With moods we can add these ideas to our arsenal. We have several body sensors that can trigger good feelings and alter our mood.

Hearing. How many of you have a change in mood when you turn the music on? Make sure you select the up tempo happy music though or your mood can plummet as mine did recently when a sad song from the 1970's reminded me of my dash to the bush escaping society.
Eyes. Look up. See the blue sky. Today a neighbor told me he saw 13 wedgetailed eagles in the sky at one time. Wow! Clouds, wow! Look at nature. Adore the animals in the sanctuary. Observe.
Skin. How many of us welcome a hug? Just someone touching us. Words aren't always needed. Argh...someone is here, that's good, that's peaceful...I'm not alone....
Taste. A mint. A simple lolly can distract your mind that's in a bad place. I love cooking, different tastes. It's turned into a hobby that changes my mood. careful not to bake cakes....they flop = bad mood. Instead I cook thins easily done like donuts, vegetable pies and Anzac biscuits. It also gets positive reaction from family taste testers. That boost confidence.
Smell. Ever got out of a car at the top of a mountain or in a forest and taken a deep breath? Argh...that's so nice. What about picking roses from your garden and placing them in a vase in eyeshot of your seating position in the lounge? You instantly smile as you sit down. A mood stimulator!!

With the mind we should feed it. Give it what it wants. What is clear is that just remaining stagnant saying to yourself ""I'm in a bad mood"" is not allowing for any stimulation and we don't believe we can be stimulated because of our mindset. Bad moods are like automatic negative irritations that we think are not controllable, not unlike depressive states. We can usually do something about it. Remember the senses and the apology to the person on the receiving end of our mood.
 It might not be your fault but it certainly isn't theirs.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 about 18 months ago, and it
took a good 12 months for me to adjust to this and try to take my medication
regularly.
My biggest problem is that I feel I’ve lost part of what
made me ‘me’.  I used to be able to a
thousand different things, I worked full-time and had several very busy
volunteer jobs, and studied, and I always crammed it in.  Now I find that I’m not really interested
when I get home from work.
 I still go out all the time, work full-time, see friends,
etc, but I just don’t go at the frantic pace I used to.  And I really miss that, because it gave me so
much joy and fulfillment.
 I can’t work out if this is because the pills make me slow
down and more ‘normal’ speed, or if it’s due to my relationship break-up six
months ago, or maybe I’m just getting older (I’m 35).  
 Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

I’ve always been a homebody but have felt my depression and anxiety get worse in recent months. At the moment I really only feel safe and comfortable when I’m at home - I’m very anxious to get home when I’m out and even have left work conferences early in a fluster to get Home. I’m often tired because of my meds but this is really getting in the way of my life - especially being able to stay and focus at work. Any tips for coping with being out??

Hello community.

I've had this question on my mind for a long time and if anyone can shed some light, I could do with some help.

I'm 24 and looking to start my career - which ironically is in counselling. When I look back at everything I've managed to do and accomplish, I have a whole list of amazing moments. I have a great support network and I genuinely love meeting new people and socializing. Everyone around me knows me for my positive energy and humor. But what they don't know is that I spend a lot of time hating myself, feeling anxious and worried and, at least for the last month, crying alone.

My depression is getting worse because I'm thinking I won't make it. When I'm in my lowest low I hate myself and I feel powerless. Every time I do something, I do it wrong. I've realised that I social with others as a mean to pretend that everything's fine but it's just fake. The people around me aren't actually friends and I have no one to turn too. I've never felt more alone and yet I find myself being the  typical extrovert. I'm tired of putting up with front.

Has anyone else felt like this? Is it somewhat okay to go against the typical symptoms of depression as an extrovert?

In the last year or so, I have started to experience depression. It isn't too severe, only lasting a few days at a time before my head clears and I am back to my regular self. What I have figured out is a pattern is starting to emerge though. In the days preceding my mental health taking a turn for the worse, I am very happy, energetic, productive and ready to do anything that is going to use up the energy I have. Then, sometimes in the space just a couple of hours, I will become lifeless. I'll be tired, unable to think, super distracted and most of all numb - all the things you'd expect from depression. If anyone out there has tips on ways to smooth the transition from going form super high to crashing lows I would appreciate it. Or even for when I am in that state, tips for dealing with the numbness that would also be appreciated! Cheers fam

Hi All, 
Just recently (last month) I lost my job after only being there 7 months. This wasn't my fault but a company restructures and I, unfortunately, was one of the ones that had to go. Its been 6 weeks and all I've done is focus all my time and energy on trying to find another job. I've been unsuccessful multiple times and find that I'm not getting far in my search. I'm getting severely anxious and depressed in the process because i think as time goes on my chances of being hired are going to drop. 
I have signed up to multiple agencies and have had no luck with them also.
I'm exhausted and feel like I cannot do anything until I find something so I don't end up in a downward spiral that I cant get myself out of. 
FEELING STRESSED, CANNOT SLEEP AND REALLY WORRIED ABOUT MY FUTURE.

2015...
The year of disasters, the year of pain, the year I loss the person I was. 
In 2015 i was diagnosed with high levels of depression and anxiety, I never admitted to it and I never accepted it. I moved to another city this year, to find out who I was, find my feet and wonder what happened to me throughout those years. No one understood why I left home, many probably didn’t care and many thought it was a phase. I was surrounded by drug abuse, domestic violence and fear. 
I was 15years old when i removed myself from my home and tried to find my own way, many would say it was stupid, but to me it showed strength, courage and bravery. 
2016 I moved back to home, back to a town where I lost the person I had become but giving it another shot.
2017 I finally admitted the illness, I have depression and Anxiety. I am not in anyway someone who thrives off attention, It could seem that way but I simply am the one who is afraid of people seeing who the real me is. I was the one who never told the truth about my family because I was simply embarrassed, but letting everyone know what I battled for many years wasn’t embarrassment it showed independence . Something I am so passionate about now, how I could come this far after everything I went through growing up, and of course I didn’t go through it alone, I had family, i had friends.
I don’t enjoy going out all the time, getting drunk, sleeping around; simply because that’s not where I want to go in life, I saw how that turns adults, I saw how that can destroy families, I was a victim of abuse, violence and I got this far and i’m not willing to give up everything i have fought for now
I lost friends simply because they wanted the party life and i couldn’t keep up with it because they could never understand how much it made me hurt inside, so i distance myself from them, and I know that was one of the best decisions, because I know have friends who will ask how I am
Admitting my depression was one of the strongest things I have ever done, and although I will always have it I now know I have people around me

For the last 15 months I've been a mess on and off due to being broken into and assaulted. Up until 4-5 months ago I managed to hide it and keep it to myself.I finally went to the doctors and I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety.  I have been struggling at work and I don't know what else to do other than quit.
Can anyone help me with what my rights are? I can't go back as it's not a healthy environment and I even get panic attacks driving to work. I have next week of from my Doctor's recommendations. but what am I supposed to do? I have some holiday leave and I'm worried that I won't get it if I don't give them notice.

I'm sitting at work and counting down the minutes til my appointment with my therapist. All 171 of them to be precise. But I'm back to trying to get through the next 5mins. Then the next.  Then the next.  I can't believe I'm back here. Again. I'm overwhelmed with a feeling of hopelessness.  That I'm in a situation I cannot control, I cannot change.  This is years in the making and I'm stuck in my life trap that was kicked off with emotional deprivation as a child. In adulthood it has resulted in poor choices in friends and partners that started as a kid. Never putting my needs first. Only attracting or being attracted to emotional unavailable men.  A 'best' friend drove me to depression last year.  I broke that off, but I'm left without any close friends.  I don't even know how to turn to people.  I'm so closed off, but that's my safe place.  Looking back, I've never had emotional support.  And without going into details, a recent diagnosis, means dating is pretty much off the agenda. I have no one to talk to or turn to (other than my therapist) and now it feels like there is nothing I can do about it.  I've been in therapy for some time - working on my life trap but it feels like trying re-write history.  But you can't.  It is what it is.  I'm damaged and it cannot be undone.  I'm looking down the barrel of a love-less life - getting older (I'm 43 now) - being alone forever (as both my mother is and grandmother was - and both suffer/suffered from depression).  I cannot help but think why bother? And then I apologize to God for being so utterly ungrateful, knowing I have a life that is beyond the dreams of some.  I'm just so done with this, the emotional roller coaster and being back down in the deep dark pit that is depression.  I'm not sure I have it in me to climb out again.

My name is Keira. I'm thirteen years old and I have had depression for two years now. A lot has happened to me over this time, too much that I can write in one entry (I tried yesterday). I came to beyond blue because there is a lot going on in my head and I think I need to get some of it out. I wrote a lot yesterday. I wrote about my heartbreak, my hospital visits, and my feelings. But in the end of all my draft entries I came to the same conclusion. I'm fine with my life. I'm not looking for an answer to cure depression because there isn't one. Everybody has a different situation, everyone has different feelings. I used to be angry, upset and confused. Now I'm just numb. I find peace in the small things, the little moments that I look forward to give me something to live for even when I'm on the edge. Most people would say I don't know what depression is, I'm only thirteen, I don't know pain. But I know heartbreak. It's the thing I obsessed over for months, the thing I spent sleepless nights crying over, the thing that made me scream and bang my head against the wall and self harm to drown the voices in my head. I know what pain is. Not all kinds of pain. But I know heartbreak whether you believe it or not. I like it at my new school, here I'm invisible. Everybody thinks I'm quiet. They don't know about anything going in my head. They don't know my past or the things people said at my first high school. I would cry in every lesson when I was there. Before I had depression I was the happiest girl in the whole school. I was popular and bubbly and I was friends with everyone. I had plans to be famous, to write books, to travel and play my guitar. Now I have no clue what I'm going to do when I leave school. I don't even see myself living past 15. I left my past behind and it still haunts my mind and it still hurts me. It shattered me. But now I feel nothing. I still think about the memories every day, but I don't have the energy to feel. I just want to sleep. But its hard to sleep when you have insomnia. Even when you're on medication. I'm just too anxious to sleep, I feel too alert. It's like I can't stand to have my eyes closed. I've lost al my emotions. I just think now. I always felt like I was different. I guess that's a coping mechanism for my failed dream of being an actress. At least I'll always be the main character in my life. No one can take that away. I've learned to be friends with the demon in my head. In a way, its a good thing they came.

May be a silly question. But I do sometimes wonder if my personality type plays a big part in me having / suffering from depression. I riddled with self guilt, sadness and a feeling of hopelessness.
Question,  if I was the type of person who could rip someone off and not lose a single nights sleep or run a business that deliberately takes advantage of vulnerable people, would that put me in a category of people less likely to suffer depression. Then of course would be the question of weather I would change to become this type of person, which I'm guessing would make me more in control of my thoughts as this type of person would be more motivated than I am now. I know it's a very strange way at looking at this but I'm sort of wondering if the type of person I am makes me more likely to suffer from this self destructive disease.

Hi, im not sure whether this is the right thread to post this on, but I'm just assuming that people on here will be able to help.
Lately (over the last three weeks or so), I've been feeling awful. I've been mentally exhausted which has made me physically exhausted, disconnected from my friends, sometimes unable to get out of bed on the weekends, and unable to motivate myself to study. I'm so teary, sometimes I spend hours crying for no reason, and at school the smallest things make me tear up. My friends have asked if im annoyed at them because they've said I seem disconnected and really snappy, but the thing is I just feel like I just can't partake in conversations, and sometimes im so mentally drained, even on days that I've done nothing, that I can't go out to parties and things.
Pretty much im just curious whether this is just part of the HSC, or something more. I have quite a large workload, but I've always managed it really well, and since I'm aiming for a high ATAR it's not plausible for me to drop anything. Thanks to anyone who replies.

One of the ways I handle my depressive episodes is by binge eating. This shouldn't be that big of a problem, but considering I also suffer from an eating disorder it makes my life hell. I'll eat up to 1500 calories because of depression, and then I'll fast for the next 3 days because of anorexia. After fasting I'll feel good about myself until I eat again. And because after eating I don't feel good about myself, my depression gets worse, and I binge eat. And then the cycle continues. Is anyone else in a similar position as me? And does anyone have any advice?

Hi, 
so I’m 21 and seriously struggling with my mental health. I’ve never been this down in my life and I don’t know what to do. So some background I was recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I have probably had the symptoms for much longer. I originally started my uni degree in social work and I realised a few years in that this was a terrible decision and I moved onto law. I have been doing law for a year and a bit and I am now regretting it to. I am struggling so much with it and I have recently gotten a job in the field and I am terrible at it. My bosses hate me and think I’m really bad at the job. They have said things to me like “Maybe this job isn’t for you” “you just aren’t getting it” “you seriously need to pick up your game”. I feel so stupid because this was so important to me to get experience. 
i feel like such a failure. I am not getting anything right. I am now thinking of changing to Human Resources. 
i am just so depressed. I’m even losing my friends. They just don’t seem to get or care about what I’m going through. They would leave in an instant and not think twice about me. I know they would. 
I just don’t know what to do with my life anymore. I am not good at anything, I’ve lost all ability to concentrate, I’ve lost my motivation, I’m sad and angry all the time and I just feel so stupid and dumb. 
i don’t know what to do. I am just over everything and giving up.

Hi guys, 
I'm a 32 year old woman who is diagnosed as bipolar and severe depression. Have been this way for the majority of my adult life. I managed to work full time up until I was 28 as a vet nurse, then I had to have a year's break. I'm back at work now after my second big break doing 20 hours a week at the same place. I love my job. I love my employers. Yet I'm really struggling once again with going in. All I want to do is sleep, I'm just bone tired. I'm just thinking to myself if I can't manage a measley  20 hours a week what the hell do I do? My employers have been beyond understanding and supportive, and so have my workmates. How many times can history repeat and I call in sick and everyone suffers? I'm in the exact same position I was in 10 years ago - when does it get better?? I've tried to help myself, have been in counselling, have been admitted to hospital, the whole nine yards. And again, how can I keep doing this to the people who care about me? I'm 32 years old and my mother still has to check in on me and make me dinner or lend me money. I keep waiting for it to get better but it never ever does. I don't want to be unemployed, I love my job, which I've had since I was 16 years old. I guess what I'm asking is, is it possible to be bipolar/depressed and still have a job? Would love to hear from anyone who is experiencing this same turmoil.

Hi,
Just wondering whether anyone else experiences this and whether they can give any advice.  I'm going through a bad patch in my life and I've lapsed into a pretty dark depression and sense of hopelessness.  To make matters worse, I feel very isolated because I don't have a 'best buddy' that I can call every day that 'normal' people seem to have, and my support network is very limited (I do have a long-term partner but I don't want to just depend on him).  I read plenty of tips online for how to help yourself during depression and the common advice is to reach out to friends and family, but what if you don't really have much of friends or family to reach out to in the first place??   I've started counselling, and while I'm at the session it seems to help and I walk out feeling good, but it's only for an hour once a week and in between I still have the reality of my lonely life to contend with.  These online help forums help a bit too and thankfully they exist, but it's not the same as having a true face-to-face connection with people.  Does anyone else feel this way?  Just feel so alone.

I’ve had depression for a long time but it got really bad due to work about three years ago. About the same time, my memory started to faulter. I have a great teenager, a loving partner, but I feel lost. I’ve had a lot of support since leaving work (until recently that is), regular psychologist and psychiatrist visits and I jangle from medications. But I’m lost. I don’t remember most of my life. I remember bits and pieces. The important things like my family, some personal history and stuff. I forget decisions I’ve made, things I’ve done, people I know, names etc. People have to jog my memory or remind me of things, even minutes after.  I just feel helpless and lost.

Hi
I think I am depressed. 
Lately I have been having problems with my fiancé in the bedroom. We haven't been able to be intimate for 2 months now because he is suffering from erectile dysfunction. At first I blamed myself, that I wasn't attractive, but he assured me it wasn't that. However it keeps happening, and it is really starting to take a toll on our relationship. I feel as though he is being very selfish in his own feelings but keeps forgetting how it affects me, despite continually telling him. It seems to be putting more pressure on the situation but I can't help feeling anger and hurt toward him for it.
I am at the point where I feel not living is an easier option, the arguments and low self esteem are so draining. Perhaps it has triggered my feelings of worthlessness. In the past 2 weeks I have had 3 panic attacks, and begin crying for no real reason.
I just want to stay in bed and not go to work tomorrow. I get so tired of having to pretend I am happy.
I don't know what to do anymore...

Hey, 
I’m here because I think I may be close to rock bottom and literally have no idea how to get back up again. I feel like nothing I have tried has worked, in fact that things have gotten worse the more I have tried to address my depression and now increasing bouts of anxiety.
I don’t know exactly when all this started but I suspect it’s been 15 years or more. 
I think the trigger points for me have been having been diagnosed with cancer at age 28 (I am now fully recovered), my father dying of a heart attack when I was 33,  last year age 38 losing my job and now in the last couple weeks my wife leaving (citing my depression as one of the reasons).
I think there are other things like feeling that I have made poor career choices that are now holding me back that niggle away. These seem to be becoming worse.
It can’t go on like this so today I am going to take it more seriously. I’m interested in any tips, that can help. I feel like there is nothing in my mind or life that doesn’t need massive amounts of work. No idea where to start :(

Over the last couple of months, I have realised that i am depressed. I have tried to bring it up to my parents but I'm scared they will think i am over reacting or if they over react to the subject. My mom has a lot of problems with depression, not in the sense that she is depressed but she reads a lot of stuff on teen depression and i don't want her to see me that way. could someone please give me some advice? that would help.
Thank you,

A lot of people have better eyes than mine 
But no one can see it 

I called my parents overseas and dad just asked how his grandchildren are, how my husband is, how the passion fruit tree in the garden is...He doesn't see it 

And I laughed my head off with mum to those silly jokes I googled before I called her because I really don't want her to worry about me...She feels guilty enough not being able to help me ... She doesn't see it 

I called my sister and she gave me a big lecture on how to eat a healthy diet and how to exercise to keep the cholesterol low... she doesn't see it 

I take my middle son to school each morning and meet a handful of school mums everyday... They often comment on how cute my youngest baby is and how big his eyes are... They don't see it 

I used to speak to few of my friends about my feelings but they have their own life too... They eventually not check on me anymore to avoid depressing news... They don't see it 

My husband who is the most significant person in my life but is always busy with work... He struggles to keep his ""demanding"" wife happy and is losing himself too... He sees me but he doesn't see my feelings or my hair cut... He doesn't see my tears or why I bleed in my heart... 

No one can see it...No one sees I am lonely. No one sees I am falling. No one sees how hard I live for others. I wonder if anyone will see it if I disappear

Hi guys,
So I am a first time poster and I have been dealing with Depression, Bipolar and anxiety for as long as I can remember. This all came out in a way that it never has before where I completely broke down at work. I was saying that the world be better off without me and I wouldn't a burden to anyone anymore. 
There are 3 main contributors to my current feeling and state. Financial, physical and mental. Those are each a side of a triangle and I am in the middle. I fall as though the side and just pushing and squeezing more and more and it's pushing me over the edge. 
I feel awful for breaking down in a public place the way that I did. I need help dealing with this and to live as a happier human being. I haven't spoken to anyone before about it except for when I was 12 and had a counsellor. I am too scared and worried to talk to other people about it and seek the help that I need. 
Thank you for listening and I am sorry if I wasted your time.

I first stumbled on this in 1997. I hadn’t been diagnosed with depression and bipolar until 6 years later but know now I had them all along. Recovering from a marriage split with kids involved, survived a suicide plan in full swing and heavily depressed when I moved into a caravan park it seemed all downhill from there but I decided to rebound.
 
To get myself financially ahead I worked 3 jobs including one shift work. I purchased a block of land and ordered a kit home, a two storey quaker barn to be used as a house. Suddenly I was flat out either working or building. My only day off was one day a fortnight while I had my kids but even then as they played hop scotch on the house slab I toiled cleaning up or moving things.
 
I became physically exhausted. I know this because I had a delivery of 60 sheets of plaster. Huge sheets by any standards and I had to cut them smaller to hang pieces on the wall. After several days the stack of sheets didn’t seem to have reduced and my old back injury returned. Suddenly, the thought of failing overwhelmed me and I collapsed in a blubbering heap.
 
Ten minutes later I got up, made myself a brew then got stuck into it again. How? Well, I’d been conditioned to be positive and never give up. Always seek the positive…and the positive was- that I was so exhausted I slept well and no longer dwelled on my ex wife and her childish antics and emotional abuse. I was proud I was succeeding albeit on my own during late nights with candlelight. 
 
Since then I’ve always taken on challenges to over exert myself so I sleep better. This is particularly good for ADHD sufferers or those that have guilt or mania or dwell on issues. Being active means keeping your mind in constant activity, a busy frame of mind, always thinking, always doing, not stopping except for sensible breaks.
There are spin offs. You succeed in doing something, creating, re-establishing your life. What's the motivation? well look for one. In my case I'd lost my home, neighbours, dog, full time fatherhood. My ex got the house and I got our garage. My motivation? Get my house back by my own hands! 
Any regrets? Well yes, I could have done with a smaller home and employed a tradesman or two. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. 
You can do other things to make yourself spent like sports and hobbies.
 
While you are exhausted you might well be thinking of a troublesome topic but you aren’t beating yourself up. Better than moping any day. Achieve and be proud.

Hi all 

Like many people, I have struggled through my life with depression.

 I have found that recently my depression has been increasing due to various reasons, feelings of worthlessness, diminished the ability to think, concentrate and to make constructive comments back to those who are asking for help.

I am proud of the support I have provided to people in my 15 years on the forums although some advice isn't accepted, but we genuinely hope to spread light on why they are feeling depressed --------------

I know others, as well as myself, have had a relapse with their depression and how it has affected them, to know that one simple trigger to anything could cause this to happen.

Has your depression become worse through personal or work related issues!

Any support you can provide me during this difficult time would be really appreciated. 

Geoff.

Hi All
I had my first bout of depression over 20 years ago from an Hormonal Injection. I recovered well and had never had another episode until May this year. I started not feeling well and not sleeping well. I started working because all the symptoms of depression were there and I am perimenopausal. I gave myself anxiety just dreading falling into the dark hole. Bam......next thing depression. A depression far worse than before.
Back to a psychiatrist who gave me medication and the journey began. But this time weeks went by and I wasn't really getting anywhere. I had used both medications before but this time my body just didn't feel right. Weird side effects and the fatigue was awful. I was no longer the woman I was multitasking and getting everything done. I couldn't concentrate couldn't think what to have for dinner everything that was once simple became my nightmare.
I went to my GP often as I trusted her more than my psychiatrist! She ordered full bloods yet again and Bingo there it was! My calcium as well as parathyroid levels were higher than they should be. I was then sent for an Ultrasound of the thyroid. Bingo there it was again. An enlarged parathyroid gland. Believe me when I tell you these little glands control the hormones in your body and when they malfunction can rock your world. One of the most common side effects is depression and generally not feeling well.
I am booked to see a surgeon in the new year to get rid of this enlarged parathyroid gland. All it takes is 20mins. Within 2months I will be able to wean off my medication.
If you don't feel right and you are being treatment resistant, keep pushing until you find the answer. I'm so overjoyed to finally get to the answer that caused this depression. I hope you are able to get to yours. Will repost after surgery.
 
Merry Christmas

Today (11th of March) is my birthday and like most special days I used to be excited about Christmas, Easter and New years eve I am finding myself not wanting to live this day. Like I wouldn't care if the day just skipped and we went straight to Monday. I think why I feel this is most events have been a disappointment to me and now my birthday is just the same.

Recently I was “fired”
from my second job. I know that when people are fired they often don’t believe
they deserved it, however this is a true case of I really didn’t deserve it. 

At the time, I was
also taking time off from my first job, as I have desperately been wanting to
leave entirely. I
thought by taking time off there, I could focus on my second job, however then
this incident happened. The time I took off from my first job was for a 2 month
period, and I cannot cancel it. So right now, I am unemployed, and have been
for almost 4 weeks. I wasn’t getting many hours at my first job anyway, and it
was an environment that was severely draining me mentally; not because the job
was hard, but because it was too simple and not mentally stimulating in the
slightest. I was losing my sense of self and a bucket load of intelligence just
working there. I don’t want to go back.

I’ve been looking
for more work, applied for some, but there are not many going around. I can’t
apply if there are no positions available, but when one comes up I make sure to
apply. I’ve not received any acknowledgment or response for the ones I have
applied for.

Not having any
success there so far, I looked into studying. It seems like a good avenue to
take, other than it’s going to cost me quite a lot of money; money I don’t
have, other than savings, but once I go through my savings I’ll have nothing to
survive on. I’ve also had a lot of anxiety when it has come to study, so the
money situation isn’t the only thing holding me back.

I’ve suffered
depression amongst other things since I was fourteen. Four years ago I made
progress, and thought I had overcome it. But now I feel it taking control
again, and I’ve tried my best to keep it at bay, but it’s a beast. I feel
hopeless, lost, miserable and pathetic. I’m an adult and yet I feel like I’m
not living like an adult should; I’ve struggled but found ways to cope in
recent years, but now I’m beyond struggling and I don’t know what to do. I
wanted to be in a stable full time job by now, and yet I find myself unemployed
and depressed.

How it came to
this, I do not know; possibly just poor judgment of character and choice of
work. In my mind, I know their actions speak more about the type of people they
are, and not about the person I am. But it’s their actions, their intentionally
cruel decisions, which have affected me so greatly. And now I am
struggling beyond belief, and falling into a black hole of depression as each
day passes.

Hi,
Um,
so I'm in my late twenties and I've had Depression/Anxiety for over 10 years,
and have gone through numerous medications and psychologists/counsellors over
that time, so in a way I'm
fairly experienced with it, eg. I've matured past the stages where I was
potentially suicidal, I'm quite good as assessing and modifying my thoughts and
actions, I'm fairly comfortable talking about it with other people
and I'm much more in control of my
emotions etc.  I do still get the common depression symptoms: struggling
to find things enjoyable/feeling numb, feeling isolated or lost/crying,
feelings of dread/hopelessness etc.

My
big problem is that while I've matured and pretty well manage my negative
emotional/impulsive thoughts and feelings. Unfortunately, I have now calmly and
rationally come to the conclusion that life and how I/we live it is actually
fairly awful, boring and depressing. eg.
My friends are becoming less social and
inclined/available to do social things as we get older.
I also don't seem to enjoy things on the same level as other people. Things
like movies, social media, going to cafes, dinner parties etc. These are all fine, and I enjoy
them well enough while I'm doing them, but I don't find them fulfilling or
particularly engaging, they're just fun little distractions, like a
mobile phone game. 
I'm pretty good at engaging with new
people, but it is very hard to make new friends as a lot of people don't really
want to expand their established social circle.
I feel a kind of societal obligation that I should be
spending more time working, even if it's
something unfulfilling. I know earning money is important, but
what's the point if in my leisure time there's nothing fun to spend it
on/no-one available to do fun things with.

I'm not suicidal at all, I just
have a suspicion/feeling that life actually sucks, and that's more worrying
because I feel I've come to that conclusion rationally. I'm also very
responsible regarding alcohol and drugs, but now and then I somewhat rationally
think maybe I should start drinking a lot more or give hard drugs a go because
maybe that'll be properly enjoyable and help me forget the day-to-day dullness
of things (I know that that is a terrible idea, but you know, carrying on the
way things are doesn't seem that much better). 
I am hopeful that I'll one day discover that
actually life is good and fun etc. I
just don't really know where to go from here.
Any thoughts/suggestions would be appreciated.
Thank you

Hi everyone.
I’m a 20 year old woman and i’ve Been experiencing mood swings regularly for 2+ years. (I can’t remember exactly how long) I have no diagnosis as of yet in relation to these mood swings. I swing from a low grade depression to hypomania multiple times per day. Occasionally a deeper depression or a full blown manic episode but these a much more rare. I also have severe anxiety which is diagnosed (GAD)  
What I experience every day is completely exhausting. I lost my social life almost completely, I don’t work because I can’t handle it. I only study part time but am on the edge of not being able to cope with that either. 
 Daily stresses often trigger mood swings. A small stress in my day could send me into a depression. Often by night I’ll switch to a hypomania and could stay up all night being creative and energised. I may change half a dozen times or so a day! My mood swings don’t seem to hold much of a pattern except that I’m often hypomamic at night. I sometimes feel stable in between these highs and lows for a short time and sometimes I feel manic and depressed at the same time. It’s all a complete mess! 
My episodes seem to be getting more intense on average as the years go on. I’m exhausted. Sometimes I self medicate to be able to chill out or I do other risky things. 
Doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists I have spoken to just keep telling me I have anxiety but don’t seem to consider these swings as anything seperate. I was prescribed anti-depressants multiple times in the past and each time they made me hypomanic/manic. 
Does anyone know if these swings may fit a specific diagnosis? Does anyone go through a similar thing? I’ll be more than happy to explain/clarify if needed. Any help/support would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for reading!

So I’m at the lowest I’ve been in a long time. I am trying to remain hopeful but it’s so hard right now. Brief story. I’m married with a 4 year old girl. I was pregnant with my second but delivered at 20 weeks about 18months ago. I soldered on after that and did really well to put a brave face on and tried to be positive about having another baby. I have been married for 5 years but I actually can’t stand my husband anymore I even think I actually hate him. We fight constantly he calls me names we are not in a healthy relationship but I have it in my head once I have another baby I’ll be happy and things will improve for us. We’ve just had such a hard run the last couple of years. I’ve just gone through my 3rd failed ivf cycle and im finding it harder then ever to stay positive because the only Person I have around me gives me no support at all and makes me so miserable . I just don’t know where to go from here.

Hi,
I am a manager at a retail store and I have been diagnosed with Chronic depression and anxiety and it’s been ongoing for the last few years. I have a team member who is also in the same situation as me, however they have been dealing with it for 20 years. My store manager moved the team member to a different area and told them that the reason was “they were putting to much extra pressure on me”. Is that a case for harassment as I never stated this at all and it felt like a way to justify their actions?

I live with my anxiety and clinical depression, it's with me every day in various strengths as you all would understand. I have tried a range of medications to try and take the edge of life but all of them seem to make the melancholy worse. No energy, no motivation which I have more of when not taking meds. I just become lethargic and always tired, basically useless. That is my ongoing experience with meds. How is it that others find meds very important for a sense of well being whereas I simply can't?

Hello

I'm so tired of meeting psychiatrists and psychologists giving general and generic advice (and in my experience they all do). They have not been through the pain and just give you
advice like you have the power to change it. You can't, it is in built in your
upbringing.
I need a guide.
Tired of not sleeping, unable to work.
I was working in employment services and they really
affected my mental well being.

My father was murdered when I was 4.

My mother is not mentally stable and raised us like animals.
No guidance, no support.  She took her
not having a husband out on us. Her legacy to us with mental ill health.  She gave us food and clothing and expected us
to become perfect members of society. Never gave us any values. Put us down. She
did more damage to us than anyone can imagine.  I am 40. I just need someone to discuss my
life with, someone I can share and bounce off my plan, so that I can move on,
but psychiatrists and psychologists don’t do this. I need someone to advise me
as they would there family member, son, friend, brother not all this political
correctness do as you feel that psychiatrists and psychologists give you. I am
bright and can do a lot but I am losing it slowly as for over 30 years I have been
battling with this.
I am sick of psychiatrist and psychologists saying you are
an adult now you can deal with it. I can't. If they had their parents taken
away from them, they would not be where they are, why can't they understand
this?

Sick of this feeling of emptiness, always thinking…
Help me…

Lately, I haven't been feeling anything. My hobbies, my favorite TV shows, music, nothing makes me feel anymore. It's mind numbing and honestly, I really don't feel like myself. But, last week, I came back from school, sat down at my desk, and bawled my eyes out. I was crying for absolutely no reason what so ever, but after you cry aren't you supposed to feel relief? Because all I felt was an overwhelming sense of guilt and regret. Then, this morning, I woke up feeling nothing. I went to go brush my teeth but all of a sudden I felt... everything?? Like, all the emotions that were deprived of me over the past weeks were all coming back in a sudden burst. But then I felt nothing, again. So, I sat down in the same chair and burst into tears, for no reason again.
 
Now, I'm in my bed, really confused about what's happening to me. I was supposed to go to school today but I lied to my mother that I didn't want to go because I had assignments to work on (which is half true) but she got really angry at me and started to argue. But, I just let it happen?? Normally, I would argue back but I just felt really guilty. She finally agreed to let me stay home, so now I'm here. I actually started crying while I was writing this (for no reason, I might add) so now I'm really seeking for help. What is happening to me?

Hi,
I'm struggling as I seem to go on and off depression very often. I don't even know what causes it sometimes but I think it's my social anxiety and lack of good friends mostly..
At the moment I'm living with a room mate/ friend and I am dealing with feeling very down for no reason. I don't want to be in this negative mood around her or anyone else because I feel as though it may ruin my friendships, but I know when I am feeling depressed I get very quiet and moody and it shows!! My friend is very loud and talks a lot so when I'm quiet I feel as if I will impact the friendship in a bad way and she will get sick of me.
I'm very rarely in a great mood - and I don't know what is causing this - if it's lack of close friendships, lack of doing things I enjoy, being in a new city that I'm not sure I like or what. I was feeling okay for a little while because I was starting a relationship with a guy and he really listened and was there for me - but i realised I didn't have proper feelings for him and felt I had to be honest. I now feel completely alone again and I don't feel like I'm connecting with anyone properly. My room mate is becoming a bit much because I feel she doesn't understand I need my space - she wants to drink and go out all the time even when I've said things like I need to do job applications and things - and i feel like its almost my responsibility to keep her entertained. I'm starting to get a bit tired of it and miss living with my parents sometimes because of this :/
It's not that I don't want to have fun but I just feel like I often need a break from her and we don't even really enjoy doing the same things and she almost always gets her way. Ugh I shouldn't be feeling like this I shouldn't be complaining I should just be trying to enjoy things and have fun I don't know why I can't and why I'm not enjoying things that I should be! It's almost like I'm just not getting what I want ever and I'm constantly just in the background getting swayed by other people.. I really can't take it anymore and don't know what to do :/ sorry for the long rant :(

Hi everyone,
I'm posting because I pretty much lost my job today and I feel awful.. I have only been working in this job for just over 4 months and I found it very difficult from the get go. I wanted to leave as soon as I started, but decided to stick it out as I thought things may improve.. my boss has been really really strict on me. She knows it is my first proper job after finishing uni, but there were a lot of things she expected me to know and pick up straight away, and unfortunately I I guess am not smart enough to do these things and I haven't lived up to her expectations..
I want to apply for a new job now, but my confidence is so hurt that I don't think I'm good enough to work at any job.. I tried really hard so many times to do the work I was asked to do, but I feel I just can't.. I'm really worried that this is going to keep happening to me in the work place and every employer is just going to think I'm a hopeless case.. I really want to improve, but maybe there is just something wrong with me :/ I just have no idea where to go from here and I am really really worried about my career and what I'm doing with my life.. I just wish things were simpler and that what I can do would be good enough :/

I have recently started to feel alone and rather isolated from the rest of the world. I have lost several friends, some of which I have no clue why they no longer speak to me or what I have done wrong. My family is rather old-fashioned and doesn't really understand why I am constantly upset and trying to explain everything to them is difficult.
I feel as if I don't really belong in this world, and living everyday is a burden to my family. I struggle to get up in the morning, find motivation to do the things I used to enjoy doing and rarely go out to any social events or meetups anymore. All I want to do is stay in bed all day and avoid as many people as I can. I know that I will never be good enough to do anything, and is having the urge to give up once and for all.

Hi everyone,
I’m new here and feel like I have nowhere else to turn. I am 39, female, have been single for most of my life and have recently had what I can only describe as a falling out with my 2 closest friends. 
I have been battling feelings of incredible loneliness for a few years now and generally am able to push through my struggles of sadness, anxiety and loneliness to function quite normally. But this year has been awful, I was so happy, had met a new man and had a great circle of friends at the beginning of the year and all have degraded to the point where I feel like I have no one and nothing. 
This is now impacting all areas of my life. My work performance has suffered, I have zero motivation to get up and exercise and even leaving the house has become difficult. I feel invisible, like no one cares about me. Because I’ve previously had such an active social life, am adventurous and travel and get out there, everyone assumes that this is still the case. I feel like I have no one to talk to, to open up to, especially due to the loss of my 2 closest friendships in the last month. 
I have made my first counselling appointment for Monday but feel like I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown because I have taken that first step in admitting I need help. 
How do I get back to the fun loving, carefree person I once was? I feel so alone and this is impacting my ability to put myself out there, even in social circles I once felt comfortable with. How do I meet new people, create meaningful connections and have people in my life I can count on? I feel so lost, am constantly crying and suffering headaches and stomach issues due to the stress of this. 
Thank you for reading and I welcome any assistance or advice you can offer.

Hi. I am a 24/7 carer for my 81yo mum who has multiple physical problems and is now getting some kind of dementia the last 2years which has not official been diagnosed. She also suffers fecal incontinence at many times the last few years.
I have been her carer 24/7 for over 5 years now and for 5 years previous to that where i would visit a few weeks at a time and return to my unit but eventually i was here so much i moved in with her. Im a 49yo male and get zero support from my family.
Ive always suffered depression and anxiety but the last 2or 3 years it has taken over my life as has the caring for mum.
Id just like to know if there is anyone else in a simmiliar situation ?

You
lost your arm or leg. However, you still can achieve things. You
still can earn some of your living. You still can play a role in the
society or in your family. People worked very hard to invent
equipment, which can complement your capabilities.  

I
have depression. I get un-welcomed visits from this Black Dog. When
it arrives, this Black Dog takes over my brain. Brushing my teeth
becomes an impossible mission, let alone going to work. If it comes
while I am at work, it takes over my mind. On a blink of an eye, I
lose all my capabilities to do anything useful. Even going home
becomes a huge effort.  

It
is relatively easy for you to imagine how difficult living with no
hands or legs can be. However, unless you have been through it (God
forbids), it is impossible for you to understand how the mind can be
crippled and you have no control over it. For short periods of time,
I feel normal; I can laugh and communicate. At most of the time, I
cannot do anything at all. My biggest problem is that I cannot tell
when the change from being normal to being mentally handicapped
occurs. I literally wake up every morning wondering if the Black Dog
is present today or not! Sadly, it has wings! This Black Dog can
disappear in a blink of an eye for a few minutes; then, it comes back
in a surprise un-welcomed appearance. In a single
hour, I experience different personalities and feel having different
capabilities, all based on how much presence this Black Dog has
around me.  

I am
a useless piece of sh*t. I cannot keep a job. I cannot play a role
model for my children. I cannot commit to anything. 

Over
and above all my frustration and incapacity to kick this Black Dog
out of my life, you blame me for my illness, and you accuse me of not
being strong enough to face my problems. My problem is not a
temporary sadness. My problem is a malfunction in my brain, which
scientists have been struggling to fix.  

Finally,
I am not trying to undermine the physical pain (as the title might
indicate). Rather, I am trying to stress that the pain of an
invisible (mental) illness can be as much as the pain of a visible
(physical) illness. However, what makes the pain of a mental illness
100 times worse is that people around you do NOT acknowledge your
pain, and even worse, they BLAME you for it!  So, I do NOT envy
physically handicapped people because they are not suffering, but
because people appreciate their suffering.

They say that the definition of insanity is trying the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result. What if on appearance it looks like the mentally ill person is doing the same thing for the same result but what is actually happening is that the person is trying something different and that difference is so infinitesimally small to the naked eye, it is invisible. Invisible to everyone, except the person with the illness.
The human mind is the most amazing and complex thing in the world. The whole world was essentially created from our minds and nature. We often venture down paths with our mind that take us anywhere and everywhere. Sometimes these paths are terrifying and unpredictable but never the less, we venture down them anyway. Sometimes we discover things that are 'too much' so we back out or take another direction. For people with a mental illness, these paths can lead to danger for themselves and/or others and can be tragic for the person and their loved ones.
This is certainly not an invitation for anyone to risk their lives or the lives of others. My priority, our priority has to be safety. We need to constantly evaluate what is happening and constantly work out if we have delved into a risky situation where that risk is too high. Under valuing our lives is a error that all of us make at some point in our lives. We can also not take calculated risks which can hamper our evolution as human beings. There has to be a balance.
My journey with Bipolar Effective Disorder has been fascinating and also caused considerable pain for myself and those I love. Unfortunately, I think this pain was a learning experience and most of it was unavoidable. Each time I have experienced an elevated mood or mania it has been the same but different. It is a paradoxical experience. It is like riding a bike, but an unpredictable bike that changes shape and form and at times the bike has been riding me. It is by its nature uncontrollable, In fact, the key to Bipolar and maybe even life, is knowing when to control yourself and when to let things be. To co exist with what you know and what you don't know, but accepting what you don't know. Patience is also vital.

Hi
   Its been a while since I put my first post on this fantastic page but I seem to hit a low again, my test score was 34 I believe how tired I am I can hardly keep my eyes open. I am in a terrible rut and I cant seem to get out of it and its really getting me down, 2017 was without doubt the worst year of my life and I was glad to see the back of it.
  I have been waiting for a basic procedure to be done its a umbilical hernia, I was retrenched so I could no longer afford private health insurance. I have been waiting 7 months, and I was told that it will probably be done in June. My marriage also failed last year as well, and that is really starting to hit home as well.
 I always hear that you should talk to people don't bottle things up and I was doing that for a while but now I have become very reclusive. I found that every time I spoke about how I was feeling I was tearing open a old wound I hate the way I feel at the moment, if they told me I would die tomorrow I wouldn't bother me.
 I know my problem isn't as bad as a lot of other peoples but I am in such a unfamiliar place mentally  at the moment I'm not sure what step I should take next.
  Why am I so tired.

Hi all 
I am new to this and I have finally found the courage to accept what I am experiencing and reach out. 
I am 26 years old, I am a female and I am a lawyer.  I have always had tendencies to get depressed and experience anxiety.  However, it is not until recently that I noticed myself getting worse than ever before.  I feel empty inside and I have lost all hope and enthusiasm for life.  I am scared of my own thoughts, and they just keep getting louder.  I walk around all day with a fake smile on my face but deep down inside I am broken and holding back the tears.  Today alone I found myself wiping tears from my face on several occasions for absolutely no reason.  I woke up in the middle of the night with severe anxiety and found myself throwing up in the morning.  The struggle to get out of bed is getting worse and there has been occasions where I have laid in bed for days straight without any food.  
I am here today to ask if anyone can recommend a professional I can see to help me with whatever it is I am experiencing.  Also, if anyone has experienced this and can share their recovery with me, I would be forever grateful. 
 
Thank you

Hi everyone, I’ve just joined and wanted to introduce myself. I’m looking forward to finding people to talk about mental illness with.  
I’m 41 and in the last few years I’ve been diagnosed with (in order) alcoholism, bipolar, chronic fatigue, and adhd disorders. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 20, but now looking back I can see I was showing symptoms from about 13/14. 
I feel crazy all the time, I can hardly work and I’ve practically cut off all social ties. My job means nothing to me and I really can’t handle full time work, but my husband hadn’t worked for years so there was nothing I could do to help myself. I felt so stuck.
Anyway life goes up and down, and sometimes I’m stable and sometimes I’m not.  I stopped drinking about 3 years ago and I’ve got a good psychiatrist. 
 But for a while now I’ve had something inside me I want to say out loud to anyone who’ll listen, “Hey I’m really sick! And all the medication I take makes me sick too! And I’m not the person I used to be, and I don’t even know who I am now. And I need a break! I need a chance to get better, But how can I find that with two kids and a full time job?”
I really don’t have anyone to talk to about this. My husband is supportive but he really doesn’t understand what I’m talking about when I describe any type of episode. 
My parents wouldn’t mention bipolar for years, but Mum has now stretched her vocab to describe it as “a head thing”.
My friends are amazing beautiful people and they’ve known me long enough to see all the best and worst. They’ve never judged me and never will. But on every single get together I bail at the last minute. I know it’s stupid but I keep doing it. 
I think what I really want, is to find people who understand me when I talk about having a mental illness that consumes me.

I am feeling caged, in my mind, I want to do all these things but due to circumstances for each one I cant so my mind is just screaming at me. My imagination has got it picture as a woman (as I am female) in a cage trying so much to get out, like really fast..... I don't know how to describe it 
The things include study, but due to finances at the moment I can't continue for 3 months (i think this is the main one causing it), Art, but I don't have any canvases, going out, but my anxiety is interfering and if I am being honest I do want to stay at home as Its been a busy Xmas/end of year.
Does anyone else feel this way? How do you cope? What are some ways to subdue this feeling?

Hello,
I'm not sure what I'm doing here again. I guess I thought that typing out my thoughts would stop them swirling around in my head, snowballing and becoming more dangerous.
You see my dog had to be put down yesterday morning. I'd spent the whole night prior awake with him, watching him be confused, disorientated and struggle to breathe. It's a horrible memory that will always haunt me. I suffer depression but I mostly manage to ignore my problems through use of antidepressants, watching TV and entertaining myself in my head by daydreaming about a better life and pretending I'm living it.
I am single and have always been due to the acute distress that anxiety brings on whenever someone was to tell me their interested in a romantic sense.  At my age (31) a lot of people are coupled up so it makes me feel very lonely and sometimes I am terrified of spending my life alone, with no one to hold me when things go wrong. 
I feel ugly, growing up the world tends to send the message to young girls that their appearance is the most aspect of them (fairy tales, TV shows, movies and magazines) and being a sensitive person I grew to believe this too strongly. 
I'm not working. I get acute anxiety and when that's at play I be extremely lethargic and depressed. I quit my job over a year ago, went overseas for a holiday and then stayed with my parents when I got back. Ever since I just haven't been able to bring myself to apply for another.
My brain is broken. Over the past couple of years I've been experiencing bouts of what I term 'acute distress'. It can be triggered by things I never thought would affect me all that much and it's really intense. Whilst in this phase I can't eat or sleep or even sit still. During the day I can find things to distract myself with (mostly) but nights are spent pacing around the house, whilst feeling progressively worse and worse. These bouts can be really unpredictable and I live in fear of it happening again, especially given I just lost my dog.
I can't cope with the fact that we all get old and die. The thought of losing loved ones just make sick and I worry about it a lot even though they aren't sick.
Despite the above I have a lot of positive things in my life. Loving family, good friends and I still have savings from years of working so am not about to face financial destitution. I just can't seem to be able to appreciate the positives in my life and just get sucked into that black void of depression.

Hey readers, sorry for bothering you with this nonsense but I feel as though I won't be able to get a good night's rest unless I type or write my thoughts out.
For a year or so now, I've felt completely uninspired and unmotivated to do things. I used to be very driven and ambitious (performing well in uni, making an effort with hobbies), almost to compensate for my social life which has always been very lacking (I was bullied badly in school and have been withdrawn ever since, I'm in my late 20's now). My confidence is really lacking and I'm too fearful of opening up to people, mainly because I feel I'll eventually be dumped as a friend for being boring (I lack a lot of general knowledge as I've felt a lot of information pointless), lacking talent (didn't pick up anything as a kid and never stuck with any hobby for long enough) or weird (although some key people in my life support my sexuality, I still don't feel comfortable at all about letting strangers know that I'm gay). I feel like I don't deserve to be confident as I don't look the part, am too awkward and weak of wit.
I've been trying to build myself up instead of just moping. A sports club has provided me with some good friendships and an exercise routine however eventually the awkward social interactions between club members has driven me away. I volunteer too which has given me some purpose and perspective, although there is still the social anxiety come every shift. I've been reading books everyday to get some ideas and inspiration, even though this hasn't been terribly fruitful (some novels do excite me though).
My current job is quite decent but I've started to mentally check out from it and am now laying the foundations for another career which I'm not even sure I'll be able to mentally pull through with. I'm in a loving relationship already but I'm always wondering if I'm just letting my partner down by being such a weak person.
I feel as though my social skills probably factor greatly in my problem, especially as I'm getting older and start to fear missing out on experiences. My lack of interest might not actually be a lack of interest but rather dismissing any activity which might possibly put me awkward social situations or that rely on the company of others to enjoy.
Sorry if I contradicted myself (or if none of it made sense) but can anyone who can understand share some insight? Would love to hear if you managed to get your life on track. Thanks.

I havent been anywhere to be diagnosed or anything so I'm sorry if when I say that I was ""depressed"" I've gotten it wrong. I know many people have actual diagnosed depression and I don't want to make that seem less important. 
About 2 years ago I was depressed and not thinking straight. I'm not sure what exactly got me out of it but I think a combination of exercising and finding new hobbies helped. 
I'm now going downhill again. Right now I have a huge assigment thing that has no deadline. That seemed like a good thing but it really isn't. When I was in school I lived off deadlines and they really helped me get things done. I've ended up setting my own deadline, finish it before my birthday (start of April) and it's failing miserably. 
Things I used to love doing now seem awful. I used to love cycling. Now I don't want to go anywhere and it's crazy. I'd cycle 3 hours or more to get to somewhere if I really wanted to and now I don't want to go the 10 min to the library or shops so nevermind the 40 min to get to my closest friends (closest as in distance, but I guess theyre pretty close to me too). 
I've tried pushing myself to do these things but it's like I don't want to enjoy them even though I do. Deadlines and threats don't seem to bother me anymore and I don't seem to care. 
I've taken a job that I don't need because I'm basically a kid and I think I just got overambitious. I'm proud that I've kept it for this long but now all it does is drain my energy that I need to be putting into my schooling. 
And to make this post even longer I've got my whole trip problem (my main issue i guess? Just the most confusing for me). Last year when I'd gotten out of things and was happy I planned a trip to England (I'm in Australia). I saved up and in January bought the tickets, thinking I'd get over this if I kept doing the things that make me happy. Well I leave in June and I'm terrified. I have no reason to be, everything's sorted and I'm staying with family,  everything's payed for and I should be happy but I don't know if I'm making a really dumb mistake.
Basically I'll try anything at the moment, my parents are out of work with all the shutdowns here and everything's falling apart. I have no clue what to do anymore.

I feel like my Life is like looking through Binoculars backwards. I was once a hopeful, happy and positive person. After a workplace accident in 2004 that triggered a deppressive episode I have been dealing with the condition ever since. I am not fulfilled by anything it seems anymore. I dread going to work as the owners of the business have lost faith in my ability to perform and it has eroded my confidence badly. My colleague is not happy there either. He said to me the other day that he had lost weight, I said that he looked good, but his response to me was 'I probably have the big C' (being Cancer). That made me feel like walking out then and there. I only work there part-time, but I am not sure I can even do that. This has been my third attempt at finding a suitable job in 12 months. I no longer even like the Industry, but what do I do when I feel I have nothing to offer an employer?
I don't want to suffer anymore, it makes me so tired all the time and I feel like I am looking at an ever shrinking life ahead, like the binocular scenario.
I feel that a move to a smaller town near the sea and away from the City might be a good move for me, away from the hustle and noise, but my partner is commited to her job and a move at this time is out of the question for her, and as I am unsure I could live without her, I remain stuck......looking through those binoculars.

Hi, I'm new to this so yeah. 
I've always had depression and anxiety  since I can remember, it  feels like my whole life has been one massive battle that I can never win. I know why I'm depressed and why I get anxious there has been a few times in my life where I have felt OK and that's when I've been working so my mind focuses on that and I'm to tired to think about my feelings. Now I'm out of work and can't even seem to get a job interview. I stay home all day and have 0 motivation to do anything. I started off being sad at first now I just feel numb, I don't feel sad or happy or angry I just feel empty. I want to change but I just don't know how. I'm seeing a physiologist but I feel like talking about my problems gets me nowhere. I'm really in a rut and I don't know how to get myself out of it. I guess I'm asking for advice on how to motivate myself to help myself. Thank you.

Everyone always says to ask for help and to talk about your feelings but I feel like I can’t do that anymore. I feel so alone and it never ends. All I do is distract myself from it for a while 
Im scared of talking about how I feel because no one ever knows what’s to say or how to help
Ive been to therapy and all it is is new ways to distract myself 
I don’t have any reason other than my family to live

Hi all,
I've read thousands of posts and seen all the advice and it's all good BUT I was born this way.
Nothing happened to me and my parents did not do anything to me. I was just born this way.
No one touched me as a child, I was NOT abused or felt up. I was just born this way.
I hated people from day one and thought they were all suspicious.  I have never liked anyone.
I would rather hate people than get to know them because no doubt they would turn on me.
I just wanted a thread for people who thought they were born like this rather than all the threads that state something happened to make them like this.
Nothing happened to me....I was born like this.

Hi BB'ers
This is my first thread. I'll keep it short as I'm on the train going to my dreaded job. Plus, would rather give bits of info at a time.
35 year old male from Sydney, Australia. I guess I have a mix of depression, anxiety and the overall issue of bipolar type II. 
I've had 20 jobs (19 to be exact) since I was 17. 
Have had counselling and was on meds for 3 years which I stopped 2 months ago on my own accord - the meds weren't worth it.
Anyway - I feel good now as I generally do on the train in the morning.
I'll be updating this thread over time with more detail about myself, my current state of mind, and contributions to others. 
Chat soon

Hi, I am a new member.  This is my first post.  
   I am struggling with motivation even though I have a full time job that I love.  I am motivated when I am at work, but when I am at home I often struggle to do simple things like putting on a load of washing. 
 I am 37 years old, single and have no children.  I live alone because I love peace and quiet.  
I have a ""to do"" list which is never even close to being finished.  I just feel like I can't be bothered, and I am tired most of the time.  However, overall I am disappointed with myself for not getting things done.
Symptoms suggest that I have moderate depression.  Please don't tell me to go to a GP.  I was on antidepressants for 6 years (2011 to 2017).  I stopped taking them about six months ago - against medical advice.  I was sick of the side effects (low sex drive and  difficulty to orgasm).  Also, since stopping the meds, I have noticed very little change in mood.  I have had problems with fatigue and motivation for many years. 
I had a blood test less than two months ago which was normal.  I.e. iron, B12, blood sugar etc. are all within the healthy range.  I am also quite fit and regularly ride a push bike (1-2 times a week).  But I used to cycle a lot more.  
Has anyone here had a similar experience and was able to get their motivation back?  How did you do it? 
Thanks for reading.

Hi
Firstly thank you everyone for just being here.
I am currently diagnosed with depression and taking medication.
As per the heading, I am trying to work out, am I depressed because I do not like my current situation or do I not like my life because I am depressed?
I have a good job, make good money, have a good house and a good relationship. But I hate my job, I hate the city I live in and just do not like the things we do. I have become a hermit and really only leave the house to go to work and social events I can not find an excuse to avoid.
I am counting the days to my “early retirement” so I can get out of here, but 2.5 years seems to far away and it was when I considered other ways out I visited my GP.
My partner knows how I feel, but she is happy in her own world and gets annoyed by my excuses and “lazyness”.
Becasue of my “comfortable” situation no one canundetstand why I am unhappy.
Would changing my life make me happy or will depression just follow me into a new life and make me hate that one too?
Thanks for listening.
Cheers
Craig

Hello everyone, i am new to the forums and felt like it would be good for me to write how i feel, and what i have been feeling for the past couple of years that i have been afraid of opening up about. I'm 22 years old, and feel like i am severely depressed and anxious in general. I have little to no friends, no social life what so-ever due to my parents being super strict growing up due to religious beliefs and my 'safety' it was in their 'duty' to keep me safe at home and not find out who i truly am by making relationships with other people outside of school and so on forth. I feel like it had spiraled from when i was in primary school i would say 1st, to 2nd grade i would get bullied a lot by kids, and it kept happening from then on until 6th grade. It caused me to end up going home crying every single day. Starting highschool the same thing. I've never been a type of person to stand up for myself.  In general i am not that aggressive looking at all i am petite, and small only 4'5 of course everyone had towered over me at school even other girls. I was born prematurely, very early! so that is why. Nobody seems to understand it, i've realised through out my life people are quick to judge and point fingers once they see something 'out of the norm'  I am a perfectly healthy girl, nothing wrong with me except i am very short. I feel like all of my pent up emotions as a child, and how people have treated me have just made me hate myself. I often look at other people and wish i could be like them. I think i have depression, and anxiety. I cry a lot, almost every single day, i feel uneasy about being near people i prefer to be alone. I often get sad, and just cry away my feelings until my head hurts. I have seen a school therapist when i was younger, but i honestly am not sure if i have depression i think i am just lonely in general. I have noticed nobody in my life stays, i feel like i am a person who loves too much and i seek for the love, i give out. for somebody to reciprocate those feelings. i feel unwanted 100% of the time, and i am scared that i have a dependent problems. I love being alone in my bedroom for hours, but then at night i get lonely because i feel like i have nobody in my life who cares about me truly. I feel like i am so depressed but then again i don't know if i am i feel like there are people who have it much worse and that i am 'not worthy' or getting help, or getting medication because i don't know if i am depressed, but i feel it.

Hi,
I'm new on here and I'm not sure how to do this all but here I go...
I have major depression and anxiety and have battled with this for many years but just recently things have gotten worse. Even though I'm going to work and look happy on the outside on the inside I'm a mess. I feel lonely, judged, misunderstood and so empty in life. Everytime I try to reach out I get rejected or attacked and I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know where to turn. I have a psychiarist and GP trying balance my med and a psycologist to talk to every few months but nothing is working!!!! I don't want to feel like this anymore. I have no energy to excersise and eat well... I'm at rock bottom...what do I do?

Hello,
I’ve been increasingly struggling to be happy, mainly at
work, but it’s starting to make me feel unhappy all the time now, and I’m not
sure really what I’ve done wrong or to cause this mindset. I love my job. I am
lucky to work with great mentors and have opportunities to learn and grow. Just
before Christmas, I applied and interviewed for a job which I had been acting
in for 18 months. During that time, on many occasions, I was congratulated on
my work and promised I would be rewarded when an opportunity presented itself. I
think I feel like it was implied the job was mine, and the recruitment process
was a formality. Well, I got an interview, and I don’t interview well, I get
super nervous and my brain just gets confused and I panic. But I didn’t think
this interview was so bad, but I didn’t get the job. They told me 10 minutes
before I left for Christmas break. I felt very hurt and unvalued, and mulled
over the whole situation for most of the holidays. I got to a point where I was
determined to go back to work, put my head down, do my job, and wait for a new opportunity.
I went back to work, and had no work to do! They had restructured the team and
taken all the work I had been doing off me. I felt like I’d gone from a leader
in the team to being discarded. I still tried to make the most of it, and be
happy. But with every day that passed I have been getting a duller and duller
and I’m starting to feel bitter. The new starters joined the team, and I know
it’s not their fault the outcome is this, but I am finding it very hard to be enthusiastic
about the changes. I’m normally very good with change, I embrace it and
champion whatever cause is on this week. I am looking for new jobs, but need to
stay here until I find something. I just want to be happy again. I am not sure
how to change my mindset at work? And I don’t want my emotion to creep into my
home life and make me feel low all the time. I have thought about talking to my
GP, but I don’t know that she would be able to help? 
Thank you for reading my (long) post. I feel even a bit better already just having written it down.

Hello all 
I am new to the forum and hope that I will be able to make some positive contributions or at least be able to empathise with others' experiences.
While I like to think that I have my depression 'under control' - after all I have lived with it for 30 years - the fact is that I live in constant fear of it boomeranging back.
And this week it has. Can't sleep, no appetite, feeling anxious, tearful and fearful. The usual.
So, I do the only thing I know works for me. . . drag myself out of bed, get dressed, and go out and fake it until I make it back again.
My frustration is that this is all self-inflicted. I have in the last 3 months taken on exactly the type of job and work environment that in the past was almost guaranteed to stress me out. And it has. I thought I was ""more resilient"" these days. Not.
A sensible person would say to themselves, ""look, I just can't do this"" and go and find something else to do that suits them better. 
Can't work out why it is that I keep returning to what is for me a poisoned well, hoping that I have developed some kind of immunity, and then getting surprised and upset when it makes me sick.
What is that I am trying to prove?
So, I am now going to sit down apply for another type of job that is less well paid, less salubrious, but which won't drive me nuts.
Thanks for listening and hope to listen to you in turn.

Hi everyone!
Just wanted to see if anyone out there is potentially going through a similar thing. I was the happiest girl in the world all throughout high-school and my early teenage years, then when I was 16 I got diagnosed with 2 chronic illnesses - systemic lupus and another lesser known illness that I'm not really comfortable sharing with the world. 
Both of these conditions are lifelong and the best case scenario is that they get kept 'under control' with constant medication which hasn't worked in the nearly 4 years since my diagnosis. I feel like I've tried every medication and every natural therapy and yet, both conditions being progressive in nature, have only gotten worse over time. 
I am absolutely terrified of the thought of them continuously getting worse as I grow older and never going away as they have already taken such a severe toll on my life in such a short time. I have become extremely depressed in these last few years. They have stopped me from doing everything I enjoy, made me drop out of high school in Year 12, I was unable to do any further study, I had to quit my job, I have zero self-confidence, I can't go out anywhere, I can't go out in the sun, I can't afford anything but food and petrol etc etc. 
It has left me in such a horrible headspace that I can't even find the energy to go out and try any new medications because it's just such a big task that has already failed so many times and I get so overwhelmed every time I think about having to continue living like this for another 60ish years. I also am so stressed about all of this that I hardly ever sleep more than a few hours.
Going out of the house is really difficult - pretty much the only time I go out is to go grocery shopping - so I have a non existent social life. I have no support from my family either so it's getting pretty lonely keeping all of this inside my head too.
Sorry for the long post - any advice/similar stories/anything appreciated. Thanks for letting me get it out!!

 I' m over putting on a fake face. I just want to be confident and happy again. I want to enjoy life but I feel like I can't..
It's affecting my life so much I've been unemployed for 3 months now because I'm to scared to apply for jobs as I feel like I'm not capable to do it.
my partner is really supportive but I feel it's going to eat away at us.
I'm not sure what to do im to scared to see a shrink. Is it possible to come put of this slump?

Last week I quit my job. I had just got a promotion and I didn’t feel I could do it and I was stressing about it all the time and coming home crying most days. Now I’m unemployed and feel so down and have no motivation or energy to do anything. All I want to do is sleep and not think about what my life has become. I constantly compare myself to others which I know is not healthy but I can’t help it. All my friends have great jobs and seem happy but I feel like I’ll never get to that point. It’s starting to affect my relationship with my boyfriend who I live with too

Things have been getting worse and no matter what I try to do, I can't seem to find a solution. I have always told myself sadness is mind over matter, and that got me through things until now. I thought I was OK and thought I had dealt with the things that are getting me down, but lately I can't seem to think about things without falling apart. I have felt very sad sometimes throughout life, when things have happened, but I was OK, life went on, I just continued. But I've never felt like this before and its starting to worry me, because also sometimes I dont seem to care or feel about things either, and that just doesn't seem to be the person I think I am or was. I only think its depression now, because I took the online test. Im not sure if it is, or I'm just experiencing really different, overwhelming and sad feelings... Im not sure about how this works, as I honestly didn't read all the information properly. I was just hoping someone could tell me what I should be trying to do next. I dont think I could talk about things to people, cause I dont like doing that. I dis some online reading, but I don't want to speak to a GP or tell my family and friends how I feel. I know I'm not feeling sorry for myself, cause that's also not me and I have never asked for help before. I sort of want to just delete this message and figure it out, but I have been trying to do that, and I can't get ahead. I know I need to send this message, cause maybe I do need some help and I don't know. I really wouldn't be here if I hadn't tried to sort myself out. I am sorry if this is not the right place to be writing this, I know there's a lot of people that definitely need the help. I was just really hoping I could speak to someone online about how I feel and if someone can tell me if I am depressed or its something else. I also had like two out of the ordinary emotional outbursts last week and I can't understand that either...Thank you for your time to read my message. I hope to hear from you soon.

As i live in an isolated regional area with all the cold weather with my depression i am finding life very hard at the moment. I am not new to BB but have not posted for some months but find myself needed help as I am sliding into a dark place which i seem to carry with me…
With not that much support available in my area at night i decided to reactivate contact on these forums as it was helpful then so why not now. STS

Hi all.
I guess i came on here to find help with my life. I just turned 36 a few days ago, and i feel like my life is falling apart. This new year has not gone well so far and its only feburary. I was recently rushed to hospital with a mystery illness. It took 3 days to figure out what it was. Thankfully nothing serious. But the whole experience made me realise what a loner i actually am. I received many messages on fb of support. But not 1 visitor. When i was realsed i sat in my house alone for a week. I've always been very independant, which i do love but this experience has really reinforced what a looser i am. I'v done nothing in my life that I'mproud of. A high school drop out. Retail working looser. I hate discussing my feelings with strangers but I'm at the point of breaking. It's affecting my work life and my home life. I'm more withdrawn than I've ever been. I'm really good at hiding it but its getting harder and harder. I feel stuck. Theres nothing that anyone can do that will make my life magically better. Magic doesn't exist. Be real. My life sucks and i don't know what to do. I'm not diagnosed with anything. I won't even discuss this with my dr even though I've been struggling with depression for many years on and off.

This is going to sound silly but I have major health anxiety and am currently suffering a bad episode after having a CT scan last week and seeing the radiation/cancer risk associated that I’m terrified as in the space of a week I’ve gone from having big dreams and wanting to do so much to just an empty shell.
I don’t look forward to anything now because in my head it’s all pointless and I just look up videos about death and reality. What happens next, how to allay ones fears.
What can I do about this? Does anyone else here feel this way?

Hi,
I'm new here and I don't even really know what I'm doing here.
I think the title says most of what I'm thinking, I'm a 24y.o nurse and I'm pretty sure nursing is my calling but my personal struggles with depression are starting to effect my work as well as my personal life. I'm pretty sure it's only recently hit me that there is something wrong and I still don't really get it. I feel like I'm supposed to be immune to feeling these thoughts inside because of what I do. I can't keep blaming my unhappiness and negative thoughts on the shift work making me tired, my boss being condescending or the fact that I can't get out of the house except to go to work and reward myself with sugar for just finishing a shift - I don't have any weight problems but I know sugar isn't what my body needs and I end up feeling guilty for doing the one thing that makes me happy for a minute because I should be preaching health. I feel ridiculously lonely all of the time. I reward myself with the justification of staying in the house all day I didn't realise until now how socially isolated I am. I tell myself to get out of the house but there's often no friends I can think of asking to be with. I have one close friend but we don't talk about this stuff. The rest are aquaintences and I feel like I just annoy people anyway.
I guess I want to know if there's anyone else in the medical profession feeling this. I feel like I should be better than this but sometimes it feels so deep that I wouln't know where to start even trying to make anything better.

In 2016 i got depression really bad and i begun staying in my house a lot. Id forever be in my pyjamas in bed or in the house cleaning. i didnt care about myself. After a while i didnt speak to anyone. My friends became distant and i felt all alone. 
I tried councelling but its almost impossible for me to speak about my emotions or my traumatic childhood. Its something ive been trying to forget my whole life. I have bad anxiety and all I find myself doing is shaking and crying. So i stopped going. 
The only thing that makes me want to keep trying is my partner and my dog.  
My partner hates the way I've become. I know he thinks im lazy and useless because he has said it a few times on my bad days. He says he doesnt mean it but i can just feel it. I dont know how these words make me sink so low. 
It feels like for every positive step i take there are two negative. Im just sinking deeper and deeper and cant even save myself anymore. 
Where should I go from here?

Since coming back from a getaway with friends, I have been slowly progressing towards a relapse. I've been feeling numb and empty in the meantime and today it all came up. I've been able to go on with my life, but today it was difficult enough to make it out of bed. I've suffered with maj. depression for a while now and I've been seeing someone about it. I have a appointment tomorrow, but I still feel so guilty about this relapse. It's the first time it has happened to me. I knew that eventually this would happen but even expecting it didn't make me as prepared as I would have liked to be. 

I just need for some guidance and advice here. Anything really. About how to go forward following this relapse and what to expect for the short and long term future.

I am 25, moved out of home 6 years ago, in a relationship for 5 years, been in my same job for 6 years, lived in the same place for 9 years. 
My emotions always seem to go the same way every morning. Wake up sad, go to work sad, have breakfast, happy for 10 minutes, stressed throughout the day and angry as soon as I get home, and that is even if I get home on time. My sibling has 3 kids, I have none of my own. I try to help her as much as I can but feel like I can never say no to them. I said no once and my sibling didn't talk to me for a day before trying to convince me to leave my partner at home to come and see them. I feel for my partner. I feel for my mum, always at work and when she comes home, she has no time to spend with anyone as she is FIFO and misses a lot. 
 
I can't make any friends as I consider myself to be ""weird"" or ""awkward"". I say things, instantly regret them. I do things, instantly wish I was at home in my room. I can't help but want something to happen to me, you know, like a car crash, illness, have a child (my partner isn't ready yet), move country, something HUGE! something to make me feel something other than sadness all the time. Then I reconsider and tell myself that's crazy and I shouldn't think like that. But the thoughts creep back in. I am stuck. I am lost and I don't know how to move forward.
 
Talking helps, but not every time, I just want to cry, and for no reason. Thanks for listening.

Hi
I am not sure exactly why I am writing this.  Or if it is just going to be more screaming into the void.  But it never seems to get better.  Meidcation or therapy don't seem to make any difference whether I am using them or not.  Maybe it's knowing that no matter what I do I am always going to be the same person, and that person is never going to be good enough no matter what.  I am always going to be dumber, uglier or slower than everyone else.  Which is why I'm going to be stuck in retail till I'm 90.  I don't know how to accept myself because there is nothing I can accept.  I have never been able to do anything on my own without help, whether I've asked for it or not.  I have always needed extra tutoring, more time than every one else to understand, more likely to make a mistake, over and over again.  Every time I try and do something different, I hit the same wall, just to be told I am too stupid or tha my ambitions exceed my abilities.  I am more of a burdan than anything else.  I just feel completely worhtless all the time.

I’ve become unemployed, part of the reason my depression worsened, and can no longer afford my psychiatrist, who charges over $150 for 30 minutes. My medication is no longer allowing me to cope so now Im unable to find a new med. He also said I need inpatient treatment which requires an upgrade to my private health insurance or I’ll be out of pocket around $3500. 
is psychiatric treatment for the rich in Australia?

Heya, I've posted on this site before but the topic had nothing to do with what I'm about to talk about here, so I decided to start a new thread.
Most of the time I'm a pretty apathetic person. I find it hard to empathize with what others are feeling on anything below the surface level. With my own emotions even, it was like they were far less dramatic than what other people around me were feeling. Obviously, it's because of depression. When I'm depressed, it's less me crying all the time and more like an extreme haze of apathy. But these past two weeks things have changed and I'm just wondering what's going on.
So yeah it started with me telling my suicidal sister to kill herself. Which was damn weird because I said it out of nowhere and something I regret for sure. It was like I reached peak apathy and graduated into a grade-a assholeness. I was just saying things left and right with way less of a filter because empathy was just not there at all. That was around two weeks ago. Don't worry, I apologized and she said it's okay but that was just a really weird situation because normally we have a great relationship and I felt Nothing for that entire week.
And then this week, I suddenly start crying and stuff! For the first time in months. What the heck. It was like a 180 and now I'm just in a state of perpetual panic because of all these ~emotions~ and I cried so many times yesterday and today. All of my emotions have been magnified it's so weird. Like if I'm scrolling on twitter and see something funny I actually smile! What! But it has its demerits as well since I was feeling extremely anxious today and then a freaking job offer called me on the phone and I denied like an idiot because I was panicking and could barely formulate thought. Its been a strange February so far. Does anyone here relate or have an idea of what I'm talking about? If not thanks for listening anyway. 
TL;DR Help my apathetic self is suddenly feeling emotions and its super freaky

Hi all,
I am 23 and have been suffering from depression for many years, pretty much all my life. Sometimes i am tired of trying anymore and working hard to overcome it. My mind just tells me I won’t get better. Seen therapists and all and have taken meds too. Therapy helps but I get better for a while and fall back into deep depression again. I just feel hopeless about things ever changing. No friends or family who understand or can support me. I feel like I need more support than I currently have. Anyone feel so low before? Like your mind is telling you that nothing will work and you wont ever get better? What can I do?
 
thanks in advance

Hi to anyone listening,
I will ask in the odd chance someone might be able t point me in the right direction.
Forgive me if my sentences are not well written. I re-read them later, and cringe.
What happens if you have left it nearly thirty years to seek advice, as I really have no choice, despite the fact i do not think they can help. My ability to cope with life just happenned 3 months ago, when I could not get answers for the pain in my back. Since then , well things have become so much harder.
I'm lucky, very lucky, I have parents while they might not understand me, love me unconditionally, which has kept me going.
But I started seeing a phycologist, for the second time in my life. THis was last week. And really do not know where to start. Does he need to know my life story, because  most of the pain I have experienced has never left me. it almost seems to me, he can not believe I have all this inside me, but I have.
I do not want to take anti depressants and I am taking too much non -recreational drugs for the Young onset Parkinsons deasease I have been battling for the last 10 years.
 
What will it achieve, an early retirement, because I finally get labelled clinically depressed. I do not want to retire, as I know I'm good at my job, but the is pressure there too.
No one would have the time to solve my issues, and I try and suck it up, and when I get a chance to talk about my pain, I get in a confused state and do not know which problem to start with, so I end up looking crazy, and saying things that will not help me, and only makes me look worse, and that I do not want help.
But truly, know one can. I will not do anything stupid, for the sake of my parents and family , as they do not deserve it. They have tried to help, but do not seem to understand the challanges i face. NO one does. So that must mean the problem is with me. Which is something I do not accept. 
There is much more to the story, there is alot of issues at play here. Too much to write here. And this is not the place.
But if something is bothering you, even if it was 25 years ago, or you think it is important to address for you physologist to understand , is it too late to discuss those issues now. Or should i just address the current situation..
Anyone

Hi
I recently started volunteering at my local community centre mainly helping on reception. All the staff commented on how well i was doing and it felt great knowing i was helping people as well. I do that on Tuesdays and this week they asked if i could help in the food bank today. I did and it was one of the worst experiences I've had in years. I was told of for using basic english talking to people by another volunteer who has been on that area for months. Alot of people who use the service have very little english due to only recently comming from refugee camps. The way some of these people where spoken to should be illegal. They where not there for free handouts, just to get heavily discounted groceries for their families. 
The experience has really sent me into a down hill spiral. For the first time in close to a year it felt like positive things where starting to happen both in my life and around me but now i just want to close the door and go back to my normal safe working life and not try to be happy.

Hi I have just joined and hoping to get some guidance on getting through my days. I just turned 55 and I sometimes feel like a fraud feeling like the way I do. I have a fantastic family, a good job and a lovely home, outside looking in it looks great, but from where I stand. Not so good. I struggle everyday with the simplest of tasks.  Getting out of bed, showering, cleaning the house. My husband is amazing, it's our 25th wedding anniversary tomorrow and I have nothing planned, and that is making me feel worse..not even a card.  I work from home so I don't need to leave the house, so I don't go shopping.
Please give me some pointers on how to get through my days better

Hi,
It's my first time in this forum, I've been scouring the internet for some research on that ""heavy heart feeling"" I have extreme tightness in my body that I can't seem to shift with exercise, yoga, meditation, stretching or regular massages. (been trying these with a personal trainer since July last year)
I'm starting to believe its emotional. Its true that when I've suffered emotional pain I try to block it out, I've felt the feeling of the wind being knocked out of me when going through emotional situations and I have grown into a place where my body feels like its constantly bracing for impact. I can't unwind the tightness, I feel like a wrung cloth and I can't unravel. 
I have recently been promoted into a more high-pressure role (no pay rise) and I listen to meditation tapes and breathing exercises and I can't seem to shift my energy to a calmer place. Sometimes just trying to take deep breaths sends me into a panic, because my chest is locked tight and when I can't take a full breath the effort sends me into a panic. (shoulders, neck, traps, hip flexes, ribs all tightly locked on)
I'm cynical about counselling as my mother is one and I've been to a few I didn't vibe with. (I would seek more professional help if I could to find one that understood what my body is doing to me) It's very hard to afford good mental health care, and even harder to explain what it is I'm feeling.
Any techniques I could try or people I could see? Any tips or words of wisdom welcome and encouraged.

I have had depression for the past 2 years and it has been slowly getting worse. I have panic attacks multiple times a week and cry at least once a day. Generally I keep these things to myself but there are friends that I see every day who experience these things with me. Recently they have told me that they don’t know what to do and don’t want to “deal with me anymore”. I know that they care about me but as my depression gets worse, we grow further apart. I feel like I am annoying to deal with and a burden to hang around. We struggle to talk because they don’t experience the same things I do, so they don’t fully understand, and I have trouble communicating what I am really feeling. After having a big fight with my friends in December, we haven’t talked once. I now rarely leave the house apart from a couple of days a week to go to work. I feel as though locking myself up and staying home is making me worse but I also have a panick attack every time i think about leaving the house by myself and without a real purpose of leaving the house to do something other than just get out. I need some advice on trying to manage my attacks and depression and how I can talk to my friends about it. They are extremely important to me as I do not have any close family, but I am unsure of how to approach them.

Hi there everyone
This is my first post on the Beyondblue community forum. So I am a 21 year old male and I have had depression for almost 2 years now and as a result I cannot sleep. I have never had trouble with sleeping throughout my life. It has only started since I was diagnosed with depression. When I go to bed at night I just simply cannot sleep at all. I will lie there for hours in my bed trying to fall asleep but I just cant. The thoughts in my head caused from the depression seem to keep me awake all the time and I've tried lots of different things and it still doesn't work. I am just curious if anyone else has experienced this and if anyone knows any good advice on the matter. The problem is that because I have a lack of sleep. It is becoming increasingly more difficult to treat my depression and to exercise because I am perpetually exhausted from not getting enough sleep.

I’m not sue where to exactly start, or what to exactly say, but I need to express my feelings and emotions.
I’m lost, and feel stuck. I’m “happy” one day and extremely down another day. I don’t feel I’m truly happy with myself or my life, everyone is living and I feel stuck. I want to enjoy life, find my passion, love the relationships in my life but I just can’t. I want to achieve things, be truly happy. I want that more than anything. I just am stuck, I don’t see any jobs that truly is what I can do, my anxiety plays a part but it doesn’t fully control me. I want to succeed, get a job, find true friends, live a life of me being truly happy within myself but I don’t know how. My anxiety hurts me when I need to recharge after lots of social interaction even with my partner, which he doesn’t understand because he is the opposite he can’t be alone. I have my passions that keep me going which is art, poetry and basketball but I feel my feelings have even affected those things. I am one of those people who just want to make everyone happy, because it makes me happy so when I am having a down day I just hide it because there is really nothing they can do, and me seeing them happy instead of worried is helps me more. I just feel lost and you reading this can probably tell I’m all over the place. I’m just sad, down about a lot of things and I’m trying to find my way out. Thank you for reading my confusing mess and I hope if anyone feels similar you are not alone

I was just wondering if anyone had experience with this... I don't really have much of a support network. I have BPD and PTSD and regularly have mood swings that take me from extreme highs to lows. It's usually pretty situational, but lately I've been having lows regardless of what's happening and then just coming out of them. But, what happens when I come out of my lows it feels like they never happened. It's almost like a switch was turned on and I can see clearly again. I'll be laying on my couch, feeling like my world is ending, then almost instantly I sit up and feel like I can conquer the world again? There doesn't seem to be a trigger to this, but does anyone have experience with this and can offer me some advice? I feel like it makes me look like I'm faking.

Hi, 
I was raised in the society for which the word depression is just a fancy way of doctor taking Fee from a patient and nothing else. I am living among people with same mindset. 
I am blessed in many ways as I got parents who love me most and would do anything in world to keep me happy and safe but I can’t say anything to them or show them a face which isn’t smiling as they are so far away and old , that this will become unbearable for them. 
I have a beautiful little girl who loves me a lot but since loss of my first baby due to negligence of people in my life, I have been left feeling every single day for past 7 years that why it was him and not me who was put in that grave. 
I don’t know how to cope with my situation. I passed 4 initial years by drowning myself in work 24/7 but for last 3 years I have left job to raise my girl and day by day I am making my life more miserable. 
When she is around me I work like a person whose sole purpose is to raise her and keep her happy but when she isn’t around I feel blank. I feel like I have been put in a box where there is silence and no one can hear me scream.

Hi all, 
For the past year my mood has been pretty bad. After graduating and starting my first full time job, things just haven't been going well. I struggled with the job in my first workplace, and was eventually asked to leave. I managed to find a position elsewhere, but things haven't  been going much better there, and now I'm very much at risk of losing this current position as well. For some reason I struggle to perform the necessary tasks, and both my past boss and current one feel that I'm not making any improvement. I find it hard to focus, and I feel tired and unmotivated all the time though I get plenty of sleep at night. This has triggered some anxiety issues, which I thought I had overcome prior to starting the job. I had severe anxiety issues several years back due to some deaths/illnesses in the family, which slowly went away, and then came back in the middle of last year. 
Now I keep getting these moments when I feel completely useless and worthless, and I'm convinced that everyone would be much better off without me. I compare myself with my relatives and friends and think of how successful they are while I'm struggling just to hold down a job. My late granddad was a greatly successful man and though I know he loved me, I keep getting these thoughts that he was ashamed of me for not being as smart and confident as his other grandchildren. At times I think that my parents are  constantly disappointed in me for not achieving anything in my life. Sometimes I feel like breaking down completely and at times I can cry for no apparent reason when I think about my life. I feel like I'm going  nowhere and I just want to leave everything behind and hide away in a corner indefinitely. I haven't been officially diagnosed with anything, and I'm just terrified that if I see my GP she'll tell me I have depression or GAD. 
Can someone pls talk me through this? I'm too embarassed to talk to my friends/family and I don't know how long I can keep on going like this. 
Thanks in advance.

hi, i am new, I have been in my job for well over 20 years but my bosses are coming down heavily on me because as many will know job environments have changed over time where bosses are now more focused on rules, red tape and bureaucracy than actual results. The bosses say my work is ""wonderful"" but are critical because I don't appear ""UP"" and I am ""late"" (it is the public service it 's supposed to about flexi time)  all that aside the atmosphere now is very tense and I feel paranoia and more depressed than I already have been for many many years ....(I am 51 years old) I have problem relatives also.  I wonder whether I should try harder to get the sack or resign....I know I should see a doctor..but I have before and taken anti-depressants that didn't work. If i go back to a doctor to try and help me get out of work it will involve many trips will become costly? I can't afford it I don't know what to should I just run away?

Depression is one of the major contributors to mounting sick days. Its as if, we will get better, then we wont take so much time off. But its short lived. 
The ramifications are big. Your boss increases his frustration whether you know it or not, it will be there. As 80% of people have little empathy for mental illness, you might regret exposing your reasons for time off. The whole saga gets worse over time. What are your options?
Drop full time work- consider casual or part time. In some situations your boss might agree with this concept. A friend of mine had a boss that actually preferred a 4 hour shift 11am to 3pm at a call centre to cover full time workers lunch break..
If you can secure a couple of part time jobs you will have more variety and sometimes more total income but less security.
Another tactic to rise in the morning is baby steps. When I worked in my own business I had to rise at 3am then drive 1-3 hours to my workplace. When first waking up to the alarm if I thought about the drain of the next 3 hours I'd  stay in bed. My method was to focus just in getting into the shower. Hot water stimulates you, helps you wake up. Remember breakfast.
Confidentiality - your workmates will judge you negatively. You owe them nothing. I always go on a ""need to know"" basis. ""Just personal problems"" as a reply to gossipers covers a lot of possibles. Let them guess. Trust one colleague and rumours will flow.
Holidays- make them count. Being idle or working at another job is not taking a break. Google
Topic: holidays- beyondblue 
Topic: cheap recovery idea, camping- beyondblue 
Following many sick days off you might have to take a punt and disclose to your boss your predicament which means telling him/her about your illness amd how you have battled with it. This happened to my friend that worked in retail. His travel time was one hour by train and a 15 minute bus. His boss had a wife with depression and sympathized. He arranged a transfer to a store closer to home. It was the answer.
Taking sick days isnt ideal. Discuss medication and sleep patterns with your doctor. Restructure your life, consider all options and limit your guilty feelings.
And try one step at a time starting with a long shower.

Hi 👋 
Im not sure where to start really. I’m 30 years old, married with 4 small children. I used to be happy, excited about life. I’m just ridiculously sad and miserable all the time now. I can’t envision anything in the future ever exciting me again. I honestly feel like life is breaking me. I feel like I really need to talk to someone but then so much crazy shit goes on in my head i can’t tell that to anyone! I don’t know what to do or how to learn to be happy with my life. Does anyone else feel like this? I don’t know how I’m going to get through the rest of my life sometimes.

So, 
after having rather acute anxiety for as long as I can remember (my first memories are panic attacks in benign situations) I have thought that maybe I do have this awful chemical imbalance. Despite my anxiety, I have forced myself to do things that seemed unendurable because I have a pretty overdeveloped rational mind as well and that part of me sometimes can overcome the hardwired automatic responses to situations and I can at least have this kinda detachment from the anxiety even though I suffer it. But I am thirty years old. Four months ago the anxiety caused what I can explain as a total destruction of self--and I had some of the most intense anxiety and depression I've ever had. I call these ground zero moments--in terms of psychology--they reduce me to nothing and there is just a fleshy body with thoughts that know something has gone horribly wrong. The first time I had this experience I was 22 and I saw a therapist. She told me I had depersonalization/derealization/GAD and depression and so on. But I 'recovered' through philosophy. The thing is, I know I have this chemical imbalance. And that it isn't my fault. But the other thing is that this chemical imbalance has caused catastrophic damage to the structures of self--they bring on the existential dilemmas faced--like meaninglessness, selflessness, hopelessness, and I keep struggling but for what? And worst of all, I am perpetually confused by existence. The second I find myself being 'in the moment' and free like an animal there is a part of my brain that detaches and says 'what the hell is going on--who are you and why are all these people around you and why did you even say the things that you said and how do you use your mouth and dont you know you are just a fleshy body and this thing called consciousness is super frigging crazy and holy cow what is even happening' and then I get overwhelmed on an existential level and either need to leave the room and have a beer or go for a run.

Anyways my subconscious structures have just collapsed and now I am an over analytical brain that is overly self aware of itself and its hard to come back to naivety I suppose. My former self seems like a distant memory and I've been like this for 4 months and can't even remember what its like to be happy. 

Anyways--I don't want to do meds either. But I was just wondering--how many other users here find the existential side of the illness unbearable??? What do you do to try turn it off?

Hi
I was diagnosed back in 2013 severe chronic depression along with severe anxiety and stress. I recently applied DSP because i realise i cant work and last year i had to quit my job due to my depression and anxiety. My depression has caused me to comfort eat and i have put on so much weight. I very rarely leave the house except for going to appointments and doing food shopping. My depression started in my early teens and it got worse after my mother passed away from cancer. My depression was caused by my family who always criticised everything i did nothing was ever good enough. From the age of 13 my stepfather became physically abusive not to the point of being black and blue but every time i stood up for myself after him treating me like rubbish he would hit me because i back answered him and he considers that as disrespect. My stepfather didn't treat me like a daughter and no one believed that he was treating me this way even now i would get called a liar because in everyone else's mind they all thought he was a great father who had accepted a woman who had a daughter. However it wasn't just my stepfather who treated me badly it was also my mother who told me i was an embarrassment to her because i didnt wear my hair down i had it up into a pony tail because i just gotten over gastro and i still had a bit of a temperature and i wanted my hair to be off my shoulders. Because of what i went through over the years i just kept on falling and falling and lost my self-esteem my worth always believing that i was dumb and stupid and had no intelligence. My depression is based on the hurt that i have suffered over time and there is always triggers that that causes me to relapse over and over and i all i want to do is stay in side my unit because thats where i feel the most safest. My family think they are helping me by telling me that depression is the state of mind but they have no idea. I get no support or help from my family they try to control everything i do and it makes me worse and it increases my anxiety and all i want to do is run away from them because i feel like i cant breath around them. I stumbled on to this site because it would nice to read stories from people who truly understand what you are going through.

Hi,
So this is my first post, im 23 and lost in life. I feel like i'm caught in a whirlpool of my own thoughts, sometimes i think bad stuff, but most of the time its me trying to think of what i need to do in life. At the moment i'm trying to find my passion ( im aware its not an easy thing), but all my dreams are so farfetched, like i want to make a big discovery or something i don't know what! after getting excited about the thought of making such a big achievement i fall into a hole in my mind, and its almost like if i can't have or start working towards this goal, life isn't worth living, it's not good enough, i know i sound like a spoilt brat but that's how i feel. I procrastinate alot... and when ever i do start working towards something, it's only a matter of time before i get sick of it (usually a couple of days).
My expectations of life are huge, like i must do something great or i am worthless and shouldnt continue living.
I tried doing simple things like art/sewing/calligraphy, it relaxed me, but the interest lasted only a couple of days, and its like i have a number of hobbys that i circulate over an over. Doesn't sound like such a bad thing but it is for me, because im looking for something i can put my full energy into, not just temporary. I'm sure most 23 year olds reach this point in life. The other thing i'll mention is my fear of time wasting... yet i get nothing done. My biggest regret is laying on my deathbed and thinking ""I wish i got there"". 
I have a girlfriend of 5 years, though i can't commit to a relationship because im so far deep in my own head, but i can't abandon my relationship because it supports me. Its sad but true.
My biggest fear is getting to a certain age maybe 30 or 40 i dont know, and if i haven't made some progress towards my passion i feel it's necessary to no longer live beyond that point.
To make things clearer my big farfetched dream is travelling space or something along those lines.
 
Thankyou for taking the time to read.

Im 35, F.
3 months ago I had an argument with my
partner(of over 2 years) something inside me changed. After the argument something
shifted inside& I started to get very bad anxiety telling me that I no
longer love him &need to break up. The thoughts wont stop & I cant
shake it off. Everything around me has sunk. I have no interest in my hobbies,business
or any interests in friends or family. Prior to this event I was a very strong,
happy, resilient person & I felt I could take the whole world on. I was fit
doing exercise& healthy. Now im a wreck & cant stop smoking. I feel
like something horrible has got me
This has been my life pattern. I have
had 4-5 very good relationships & 1day something happens inside me & I no
longer feel anything for these people & I spiral into a very bad depressive
emotionless place. One in particular when I was 20, like a switch went off
& all feelings gone & I cant be with this person. what followed was
even worse, years of grief for this person, drugs & alcohol & 15 years
later I still think about him. At 25 & a drug OD drug overdose I decided I couldn’t
live like this any longer & got help. I started to see a naturopath &
within months I was like a new person, the best version of myself I ever knew. I
had 10 years of feeling fantastic like I could do anyting,i had the sharpest
clarity of mind. I have always told myself that if I was in the good space I could’ve
made these relationships work. Yet here I am again faced with this demon about
to ruin my life because these crazy thoughts wont stop.. All I ever wanted was
to be loved & have my own family.I have the best partner in the world right
now & I cant even give myself that because im about to destroy it & I don’t
know why?! I get down when I see people around me that are pregnant & happy
in their relationships, or when I look at FB & I see my friends getting
married, engaged or having babies. When things were great with my current partner
I could not be without him. I looked in his eyes and I saw the rest of our
lives together,I saw our own family.  Now
I cant see anything & im sinking deeply in my life & everything is
falling apart. i am praying that this is just depression & I will get out
of it soon& life will go back to perfect, but this is taking its toll on
both my partner & I & we’re both in no man’s land with my condition. Am
I out of love because I’m depressed, or depressed because fallen out of love?Yes
I’m seeing a psychologist but its every 3 weeks

When I was younger, i was happy. I know being nostalgic always makes people imagine they were happier than they were, but i remember how the voice inside my head used to be. She was optimistic, supportive, forgiving, and had this underlying sparkle of hope. My inner voice now is always berating me, telling me to give up, telling me to eat more to feel a momentary bit of happiness, telling me I am a failure. I have been through a lot in the interim - worked a job for 4 years i used to love, then grew to hate, met my partner (a supportive yet anxious introvert), adopted my dream dog, started my own business, and had a back injury 6 months ago which stopped my part time job as a yoga teacher (I spent thousands of dollars to become certified as a yoga teacher, and 6 months after starting i had a disc prolapse which rendered me unable to walk for a while. Being on painkillers was great, but coming off them, i think they made my antidepressants stop working.
I feel tremendously weaker, older, sadder, fatter and uglier than i did. I just feel like i don't fit into this space i carved out for myself anymore. I don't feel smart. I don't feel inspired. I feel isolated, lonely and sad all the time. 
Every day is a struggle to get out of bed, i feel redundant in this world, I feel like i have to work extra hard as an expat. I have medicare, but i am finding it really hard to get the help i know i need. I don't have a lot of money, as my business is only a year old - but when i asked my GP to recommend a psychologist, he gave me a referral to see one that costed $200 a session. He knows I don't have a lot of money, he knows i am on medicare, idk if he was testing me? So now I have to ask again - arent you supposed to get 10 sessions free with a psych? I desperately need to talk to someone to make sense of all this. I feel lost, hopeless and like nothing will ever help me to be happy again.  I know i am reinforcing these negative thoughts by writing them down, but expressing how i feel (though its making me cry more) feels cathartic.

I've been living with depression (inc. Anxiety disorder and BPD) for over 15 years now. At this moment in my life I have finally got a stable, well paying job, my kiddies are all off to school and hubby and I seem to be doing great together.
I have tried to do online Uni and went well for one semester and then crashed out after that. My hubby and I are trying to save for our own home and we'e just had Xmas and school holidays. 
Things seem to be piling up and I am starting to get physical symptoms back: bad bowels, sleeping disturbances, headaches etc. Mentally, I'm exhausted. Im angry, short, emotional etc. All the signs are there. I seen my GP when I first recognised it and then had a follow up and I was feeling good again. Now I'm not. I feel like I am cycling through moods and I am so lonely... I see my GP again on Tuesday. I feel stupid that I can't get this under control. My hubby doesnt understand, when I push him away he pushes back, then we argue.  
I've got no friends, no hobbies and no sense of personality or identity for myself. I'm lost and these depressive episodes are more intense and coming closer and closer together. 
Its scary.

Hey. 
So one of the biggest struggles I have is that I can never really remember and still don't have any dreams. My goals are simply to be happy but I don't know what actually makes me happy! 
I guess I lack ambition too.
So I guess where have others gone to find goals and dreams?, which hopefully leads to the ambition.

Life has become.... unbearable. I feel consumed by my darkness in ways that's I've never tried to articulate into words. The last 6 months I've felt so alone in the world like I can't talk to anybody. I feel so set in my isolation, I miss talking to people but can't help myself but continue it. I don't know who I am anymore. My depression is who I am right now. It's all I have. I can barely remember a time without the constant torment. As I tough through this phase, I have come to realize that I hate myself. That I honestly feel like I don't deserve help, so I use excuses to prolong my suffering. 

As I write this, thoughts of being melodramatic and to get over it plague me. My obsession with self pity is making me yearn a more permanent state of being. I feel like an outsider to my own journey, an alien to my existence. It takes all my being to just not give up, I don't want to. Because as distant as my past seems to my current state of mind. I do vaguely remember what serenity feels like. 

I haven't left my home in over a year.  I haven't spoken to anyone in half that time. Both scare me to over come. I need help with it but I don't know how to ask. I can't do it for anyone else, I have to do it for myself and that's the greatest challenge of all because when it comes down to it. I don't feel like I'm worth it. Maybe this post to myself will help me, maybe it won't. Maybe someone can relate, I hope not. 

I am a lost soul, in a perpetual spiral of sorrow.

I feel like I’m ruining everything. I’m constantly upsetting people because I just can’t stop getting angry. I’m always so irritable and anything will set me off. My anger is always too intense for the tiny thing that upset me. I don’t know why I always overreact in this way. It’s pushing people away from me. I’m hurting people but I just can’t bring myself to say sorry. I just can’t apologise. If I could it would make things better but I just can’t and I don’t know why. I always just feel so empty and worthless and small issues always seem bigger than they are. I get this small amount of satisfaction when I cause an arguments because at least I feel something, but it always comes crashing down around me. 
Please help me

Hello all
I am new here but wanted to share something I noticed recently.
I have been in a slump for awhile. Not wanting to see or speak to family and friends. Wanting to avoid any human contact at all costs.
I usually avoid the train but had to take it the other day. When I disembarked I noticed a lady struggling with a cane and a suitcase. I offered to take her suitcase for her and as we slowly made our way down the platform we spoke.  I was surprised how relaxed I was speaking with her. And that I felt less burdened than I had in a long time.
Her gratitude for helping her made me feel... good. 
This feeling motivated me to try to return a lost wallet I found this morning to its own.  Again, it felt good.
Has anyone else noticed this?

Trying to beat the thoughts telling me all day that im a nobody, loser, ugly, fat,etceven though nothing directly has occurred sometimes to make me feel this way. It is such a tiring and draining battle 24/7 365 days a year fight to be in a fight that never ever ends and the mind never lets up. Im starting to feel that nothing short of a mind transplant will fix me.
Some people would look at my life and say im a lucky person and there are most certainly people worse off than myself so why wont my mind accept that and let me just get on with my life and stop thinking negative thoughts whilst im not dorment and asleep. I feel like I cant keep fighting a battle I cant seem to win it just absolutely destroys my morale and doesn't allow me to start regaining my lost confidence and self esteem. 
I cant ever remember being confident or having self esteem it was never allowed to develop when I was a child. Being constantly put down by your parents will do that to a person I guess. 
Surely there must be something or someone out there that can help a person who really doesn't know where to turn next. I have honestly tried nearly everything out there and im still here today 32 feeling worse than ever. My life isn't even that bad but my mind just wont see it and believe it. I consciously know this fact yet still cant change my state of mind.

I wonder what could have been. Who would I be if my illness were non-existant? Would I be successful? Would I be happy? Would my strongest friendships and relationships have actually lasted? Would I feel so isolated and abandoned…?
It is the wondering that hurts the most. Forever contemplating what could have been had I not been held back by the inefficiency of my own brain.
These thoughts never leave my head. These thoughts keep me awake at night and distracted throughout the day. An endless cycle of what ifs.
I have given up all hope of these thoughts ever subsiding. I have given up hope of ever being truly happy. I have resigned myself to a perpetual battle with my own mind; and with such resignation I have empowered myself.
No, I will never be content. No, I will never be “normal”. No, I will never love myself and have sufficient confidence to brush off my insecurities. Yet I am strong; I will survive. I will forever battle with the demons inside. Surrender is not an option for me anymore.
With understanding and acceptance of my illness I have found the strength to fight. To stare into the eyes of the black dog and say, “Not today mf. Not any day.”
I will never back down again. I will never take the easy way out. I will struggle. I will hurt. I will cry, and rage, and scream into the night; I will polish my armour after every battle and despite my exhaustion I will continue to fight.
I may have depression, but depression doesn't have me.

Recently I think I can feel my antidepressants starting to work. However, I spent so long when I was depressed telling myself that I don't want to get better or be happy, and still feel that way to an extent. Now I feel like if I start doing things that would be good for me like doing schoolwork or going outside it would undermine my progress and I will lose what I spent so much time on, and return to mediocrity. The only downside of not doing work is that it would just draw attention which would just be uncomfortable and humiliating and something I want to avoid, but I can't bring myself to just be good to myself. Perhaps this lifestyle of just doing nothing is more comfortable and i'm too lazy to do anything else, or I feel like my depression/misery was an excuse or achievement in some way. Does anyone have any advice for what I should do?

It's just my opinion, as I have been through this so many times in my life before and it's an ugly place to be in.

Today has been a bad day. I usually manage everything on my own but because a have a friend I thought I could rely on, I asked for help. I was let down this afternoon and now feel totally frustrated. My anxiety was high for other reasons, which my friend knew about. Of course my anxiety skyrocketed. I have Bipolar 11 and have lived with anxiety and depression all of my life. I'm now in my early sixties. Sometimes I think I'm better off shutting myself off from the world.

I've never posted online but am desperate for reassurance. I've already come across a similar scenario here, but feel the need to share my own experience. 

I am a 28 year old who has a long history of mental illness including chronic depression (anxiety, eating disorders, OCD, you name it). This has had a significant impact on my life, but I've always managed to keep it well hidden (out of shame and self-preservation - the stigma is terrible). I'm in therapy, on medication, and have even quit drinking since my drinking behaviour wasn't very healthy. 

Despite all of this, the thing that I'm most ashamed of is that I've never been in a serious relationship, not only because my mental illnesses have held me back, but also because a traditional family and upbringing prevented me from dating as a teen, so I never set solid relationship foundations for myself. I'm 28 with relationship experience limited to flings and crushed hopes. 
I'm trying to internet date but have had poor experiences: I've been lied to, ghosted, and faded out on. I'm starting to think maybe people sense something is up with me, and they run as soon as they do. Or, perhaps I get a little too hopeful too soon, which scares people, so people run off again.  I recently came out of something (I couldn't really call it a relationship - two months or so of dating and long conversations?) and was heartbroken when I found out he wasn't fully interested.

Is there something wrong with me? I've believed for so long I was unlovable, and now that I've tried to date, all these poor experiences seem to validate this thought - I'm not capable of being loved. I've been single all my life and my loneliness is really affecting me. It's making me desperate for SOMETHING. Is there something wrong with me that I've been single all this time? Is there something wrong with me that no one wants to be with me, or give me a chance?

 I have a mood disorder that my parents do not recognise. Instead they believe I just have a bad behaviour. They were offered education at the last family meeting but refused it saying they knew enough. It wouldn't be an issue if I didn't have to live with them. They are critical of everything I do or say. They told me I can never end up in hospital again for anything physical or mental health because they don't want to have to pick me up. Obviously it is a promise I cannot possibly make. It is wearing me down and I was only discharged from hospital for depression in December.

Hi.. i have BPD/depression/anxiety.
I was in hospital for a few weeks before christmas and I went through ECT treatment. Now I am at home, at my parents house with them looking after me, and tonight im just feeling lost. Looking on facebook I see people getting married, having babies, finishing uni degree, getting a new job etc and I feel sooo hopeless and empty. I am ANGRY that mental illness took my life away from me and I feel like everyone around me is growing up and getting on with their lives and I'm just this sad, scared little girl and I don't understand why I'm different. 
As part of the BPD i suffer dissociation episodes which tend to happen at every appointment I go to whether its gp, psychologist, support worker, or centrelink. These episodes vary in which sometimes  I can snap out of it or other times its too severe and ambulance needs to be called.  I wish I could function ""normally"" I am tired of living like this. :(
I dont know why Im posting tonight, I guess I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions for me.

A month ago I quit my job, after 2 years of a new manager who had dreams of everyone around him being slave labour after he took things way too far and was caught red handed bullying staff into 3 am starts for a 9-5 job, forcing them to work for 15 hour days without break and intentionally creating ""emergencies"" over the top of peoples day's off and personal arrangements.
Sadly this hasn't been the first, second or even third job I've had to leave because bully culture and its left me unemployed working UberEats, feeling like there is no point to trying to get ahead anymore as its hopeless.
Too make matters worse, today I went to do a trial in my former trade (baking) and couldn't complete the shift due to my lower back playing up out of nowhere - leaving me feeling useless.
I'm now at home, with a hole of pain were my back is meant to be, with no idea how to proceed forward with my mind feeling like a cracked glass likely to shatter at a single bad tap.
I don't know what I should do............

Hey everyone, first time poster here.
So im 23 and was diagnosed with depression at 15 and I have a 3yo son which is suffering more than i am. Today is definately a new level of breaking point, i couldnt feel like a worse parent. 
Back when i was first diagnosed with depression looking back now id say its was all pretty normal these days for a teen, i was medicated etc and all was ok. When i was 18 I entered what turned out to be a mentally abusive relationship and fell pregnant with my son. His dad was in and out of the picture the whole time which put so much stress on me. When my son was born, i couldn't even look at him, this lasted a few hours and for the first few months i had no connection to him at all. As if i didnt feel bad enough about that right? Anyway, time went on and ive just established i dont have a maternal bone in my body which really bothers me. I just want to be the best mum i can be for him. My beautiful boy is now 3 and the easiest child ive come across to parent and look after. He deserves so much more than what hes getting. 
Ive been trying to find the right medication since i had him, to bring me back i guess. The one im on at the moment i don't feel is doing anything, just like the others. I have an amazing partner who helps me so much but i think that only makes me feel worse knowing i don't know where my son would be without that support. I have the kind of side effects where i would sleep all day if i could. The kind where you don't wake up to anything like alarms or when your childs in trying to wake you up in the morning. Yes, when my 3yo son is TRYING to wake me i don't even know. My partner went to work this morning and left the back door open for our dog. I woke up at 10am to find my child on the couch, the door open and the back gate unlocked (which he can open). So much could have gone wrong all because of me and my problems. I've never felt like such a horrible mother. 
I go to the gym when i can to try help, i try my best to maintain a healthy lifestyle, i take the medication im currently on, im doing everything i can to try stop being the way i am and its just not working. I feel like the doctor i use just doesn't understand but im yet to find one who truly does. I guess i just dont know what to do anymore and im petrified of not being concious when my son needs me and not hearing him if he screams at night. I want to be the best parent because hes the most perfect thing thats ever happened to me. Thanks for reading

Hi everyone,I find myself on these forums having searched the Internet for some kind of relief and comfort, as I have been feeling particularly bad depression lately, and definitely today.I'm a 26 yo female who has recently been diagnosed with C-PTSD resulting from intermittent physical abuse and prolonged emotional neglect throughout my childhood + teenage years. I have coped 'decently' until the last couple of months, however have not been doing very well recently.I feel so worthless, with no hope for my future in sight. I don't like myself, and I feel so lonely. I have many acquaintances, but no true friends. No one that I can confide in, spend time with outside of work, talk to. I have family, but none that I am close to and feel I can reach out to. The family I am closest to are those that neglected me in times of need as a child, and I could not speak to them about my depression, feelings of worthlessness, as they would tell me to ""snap out of it"". I am lucky that I have a wonderful and supportive partner, but I worry that my depression is taking its toll on him. I am not interested in sex, I cannot do anything with him, I am always crying in bed, and he is worried about me but cannot do anything. I am starting to think he would be much better off without me. I just wish I wasn't here. I have had job for the past couple of years, in which I engage with many different people very frequently. I resumed after the holiday season, and it was more difficult than ever to come back and hear everyone's stories of their wonderful holidays. I spent most of mine in bed, sick, feeling lonely, wishing I were someone else. I am a people pleaser and project a very friendly and confident disposition at work, and after 2 days, it had exhausted me. Now I have taken a sick day and have been lying in bed crying. I'm worried my boss will be angry as I have taken quite a few sick days over the last year, but being at work was far too difficult, with me on the verge of tears the whole time and unable to concentrate at all. It is exhausting keeping up a facade of happiness in an incredibly social job. I feel terrible. I wonder if things will get any better, but I don't think they will. I hate myself, I wish I were someone else. I guess, amongst all of this that I'm hoping someone might tell me that things will be ok, and that I won't feel like this forever. I don't have anyone except my partner to talk to that could possibly understand, or care.thank you beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hi all, What do you do when nothing seems to help? I've suffered depression for many years, since my teens (now in 40's). I first went to my doctor in 2001, was put on AD's. Struggled with work, divorced and slid deep into a hole. I have a psychiatrist, my second, who helps a bit but mainly gives me prescriptions. Currently taking four different medications. They help but still get bad periods. I have tried CBT and a phycologist which didn't really help.
I have a good life, good job that pays me well, good wife and 2 children under 10, no debt apart from mortgage. I work part time and do the school runs etc as my wife works full-time including 2 of 4 weekend a month. For a while our son (7) has been a huge handful and nothing i've tried has worked with him. He'll flip out over the smallest thing and kick and hit and throw things. I've read lots of info to try and educate myself with possible solutions but nothing's worked. I've reacted badly a few times which leads to more depression. I'm smoking again which my wife hates so that is causing friction. Feel like walking off into the sun set but never would because of our kids.
Years ago when I was at a bad point I told my family about it but it got swept under the rug. I then admitted myself to hospital for fear of suiciding. I recently again told my mum and she hasn't even asked me if i'm okay since then. I have no one that I can talk to to get it off my chest, which I miss being able to do.
I dream of moving back to the country and simplifying things. Get away from the 'must have all these new things' type of life most seem to live. Unfortunately it won't happen.
What can you do when the depression never completely goes away? At times i'll go months feeling good but then something sets it off and 'bang' i'm depressed again.

My first post ! Been in a dark place for a while now. Unfortunately didn’t seek help. Realise now that I need to do something if I want my quality of life to change. I’m relocating to a warmer state to rejuvenate and rebuild but with all the professional support so can get. Hard part is that I’m leaving my wife behind as I feel I need a completely new environment and just don’t have the love to give to anyone let alone myself. Now I’m covered in guilt as well as depression. I know in my mind I need to do this however scary the future may be. Just feel so sad for letting people down😥

I'm 39, having worked full time since I was 20.
I hold down a fairly well paid job in I.T and have done so for 10 years.
I have no debt, rent a place on my own, pay my bills.  
I have a girl I've been seeing for the last 2 years.  She says she's in love with me.
From the outside, my life appears to be pretty set.
Inside, I am slowly coming apart.  Slowly dying a little more each day.  Unable to deal growing sense of crushing failure and disconnection.
I am bitterly disappointed that having worked so hard to build my life... I'm unhappy.  Miserable. Empty.  
Nothing brings me any real joy.  I never feel elation, or pride.  I never feel the rush of passion when I make love to my girlfriend.  I'm numb.  I set goals, achieve them and feel nothing.  I strive to make some positive change in my life, only to find that when I finally achieve them.. I feel nothing.  Then I feel anger.. So much anger at being cheated.  Where is my peace? Where is my satisfaction in a job well done? Where is the warmth of holding a lover?  
I've tried a variety of drugs, spent thousands on therapy.   In the end, they usually just send me away.  They're used to dealing with people who've had real problems.  Child abuse, PTSD, divorce, bereavement.  What am I doing wasting the time of a therapist.  
I have failed in every way that mattered to me.  I am broken inside and I just don't know what to do anymore.  I think about leaving my girlfriend daily.  I think about calling my best friend and abusing him for abandoning me when I need him the most.  I think about the disappointment of my family.
I thought I'd have it figured out by now, but I'm lost.  
Why does it have to be this way?  Why can't I just be happy.

Hello im a 25 year old male living in au. For the last 2 years ive had really bad social anxiety which has made me drink in social situations to get through. But in the last 6 months ive just been feeling worthless like lifes not worth living anymore. I wouldnt do anything though. I wake up everyday tired no matter how much i sleep. I have no motivation or energy to workout. I come home from work and either sleep or lie in bed from 2.30pm till the next day. I find it easier to hide away at home than to see friends . My bed has become my safe place . I feel to anxious to go to the doctor to get sorted out . Im not sure what to do. Ive never posted anything about this ever. I think i might have low testosterone because i have many of the symptoms . I just dont know

Been to doctors and told have anxiety and depression - can't take time off as am self employed and professional career.  Even though I have found love he has his own issues and the only thing that brings me comfort is my cat

Hi,
I don't know whether I need some treatments or simply mood disorder..
I do not have any friends or family here, just my family. Therefore I resigned and decided to stay home to look after my baby. Before I was working I still could manage my emotion. But not anymore, I am having very negative thoughts, worries, anxiety these 6 months. I cant talk to any one as it seems there is no one willing to listen , even my husband. So I started to talk to myself, there is a voice inside me keep talking and bringing up all my problems. Most of the time I feel so empty, like I am sitting with my baby, but not feeling like I am actually here.
And because of these problems, it makes me lost power to appreciate, to see the good side of others, even my husband, I keep blaming him and very easy to lose my temper.. Though I am going through this, I still can smile and feel happy sometimes. 
 
So my questions are :
Does people have depression still feel happy? 
What is wrong with me? Do I need to see specialist? 
(Sorry for my grammar ....I tried my best..)
If you have gone through similar situation, can you please share with me ..
Thanks,
A new mum who wants to enjoy life...

Every now and then, along comes an article that blows your mind and makes incredible sense. The one I'm refering to is just what I needed to explain the modern day depression in some of us. 
So please google the following:
depression is not a disease but an indication that consciousness needs to change
Open for discussion.

Hi all!
I've been struggling with mental health issues for ages. I was institutionalized and it was discussed I could have manic depression but nothing was ever solid. 8 years on, I'm still struggling and haven't had a firm diagnoses. The psychologist I'm seeing now is incredible and she's teaching me to not self-pity and to move on past a diagnoses. She wants me not to cling onto the idea that something is wrong with me, that I don't need to prove anything to those who didn't support me during my darkest times (my family). She believes I love the dramatic lifestyle and that I thrive on people's pity. I agreed with her, but it's been a month or two after we came to that realization and I still find I have great difficulty 1) feeling anything, 2) controlling my emotions, 3) controlling myself altogether. 
My partner believes I have mood swings, I get into very obvious bouts of anger and jealousy. I spit mean things at him then the next day or a couple of hours later, I apologize and admit that's not the normal me, nor who I want to be. I don't know who I am, I feel like I'm constantly changing. The yesterday me is not the today me, the 12pm me is not the 2pm me. I'm also constantly empty/bored. I feel like there is a switch in my brain I can't control. 
From battling with this for years, I would self-diagnose as Borderline Personality Disorder. However it's so difficult to not doubt yourself after my psych told me what she did. I can't tell if I'm just being 'dramatic' because for years I've been searching for the reason I'm like this, or if there is actually a legitimate reason. I can't tell what I should do with taking the next step forward. Should I seek out a psychiatrist that's happy to help diagnose me, or should I just keep believing that I don't need that confirmation and continue therapy with my current psychologist? I'm scared that if I get diagnosed, I'd put myself in a box and excuse my actions for it.
Thanks for reading all this. Any response, even if it doesn't offer any advice, is welcome

My ongoing depression and anxiety is under control however the ongoing existential crisis is not. I'm no good at self delusion and this is essentially what is suggested I do... nearly everyone starts with the statement 'live is worth living', where as I start with 'is life worth living'.... The outcomes to these 2 questions are vastly different. I know for me the only answer is to walk away from all convention, and attempt to find stillness.......  life is futile... life lived in the mind is futile

I only realised I truly had depression when I was 21. The seeds were planted when I was younger but it hit home one night walking along the highway half drunk nearly getting hit by a truck. I let it out to someone for the first time the next day that I had real problems and broke down like a blubbering baby. Ive been on and off medication and in and out of councillors for many years and still to this day while I write this piece I struggle on a daily hour by hour basis.
Councilling and medication certainly helped me learn ways to try to deal with this disease but it never goes away and it hurts so so bad. I hardly drink and have given up so many of the things I believed trigger my depression but still at this very moment I am fighting my mind and it really does tire you out fighting 24/7 with your thoughts and feelings.
I am a very open and honest person so these thoughts and feelings are straight off the bat. I struggle badly with my self esteem and cant get these horrible thoughts out of my head when I look at myself in the mirror. My weight has become a battle in the last 3 years and am currently caught in a vicious cycle of depressed because im eating and eating because im depressed. I am a fat negative loser at the moment.
I have no contact with my dad and none now with my mother. Thats one thing that gets me down. But they make me feel bad about myself so I have given them the flick. My old man for 6 years or so. I am married to the most awesome girl in the world she is my everything but me being the way I am I can never give her the best version of myself. I try not to tell her all my dark thoughts and feelings as it pains her and she doesn't truly understand why I have this cancer inside of me.
I have been off medication since march and therapy for a year as I don't want to rely on it to live my daily life. I have tried hypnotherapy to get over certain issues and phobias with no luck. Honestly if I could trade my mind for a another one I would if it was scientifically possible. I would even offer myself as a test bunny if it were possible. Wipe everything in my mind except for the memories of my wife. Reboot my mind computer and give me a chance at a less stressful existence. People that haven't suffered depression have no idea of how much it takes over your life and is a monkey that lives permanently on your shoulder whispering nasty things into your ear straight into your mind. I hate thinking and feeling like this for the whole time i'm awake.

I have worked really hard for my job, and I have always enjoyed it up until now. As a requirement of my job, I have had to relocate from the metropolitan area in which I grew up to a small rural town. As a result, I had to leave my position at the time, and move out of my family home for the first time to live by myself. It was incredibly hard establishing myself at my new work place with no support network around me and nobody to debrief to once I got home from work. I felt absolutely miserable. I was crying almost every single day and constantly feeling regret. It got to the point where I took a week off ‘sick’ because I just could not get out of bed. I was diagnosed with severe depression and moderate anxiety and started seeing a psychologist. I told him I wanted to stay in my job because I did not want to feel like a failure and disappoint people. He gave me some strategies to help me cope and they helped me get through the rest of the year. After being back at home with my family for Christmas and New Years, I am beginning to panic about going back to the place that made me so miserable. I just don’t know what to do. Either I keep working and suffering in silence or I quit my job.

Imagine it. You are a ship in the ocean. 'Normal people' live on land and you visit there often but you are drawn back to your ship at the docks only to be sent off again on a trip to the high seas (depression)
But there is no destination and no adventure In the ocean all alone you shut down the engine because- well there is no sense in proceeding when you have not directional control - no rudder (medication). Perhaps your parents were also born without one, or you had an incident or your construction is made of soft wood.
So you go into the dry dock. Here you are dried of all control where others can evaluate you, ask you questions and repaint you. They install your rudder then put you out to sea. You head off with complete control but you have no map (therapy) nor do you have any contact with others (land) and others feel ""out of sight out of mind"". Land is not life on the high seas- they wont understand. Only sailors do.
You search through to find comfort to find a map but this map has missing pieces (consultations), much searching is needed to find the missing bit to join them together.(therapy sessions). During this voyage your rudder is unreliable, the linkages are fragile. Your direction is always vague. You stand on the bridge with waves drenching your face often. You often want to kiss the world goodbye as you feel irrelevant, often adrift without energy. Some ships make it to shore but have to use anchors to land so they repel the forces that drag them back out to sea.
Being a ship you will never be thrown onto land like most. But you do get some people waving at you from the shore. Lovely but not enough to call it support. And you do get the odd ship passing by throwing a rope ladder to connect you so you dont feel all alone, nice, but they also have their own problems as they are ships themselves.
You accept that you are indeed a ship and always will be. You also realise that you can let out all of your emotions when ever you want,in your own hull. The echoes are deafening. 
The dock managers (psych's) know your struggle but when at sea if you have no rudder (meds) they cannot help you.And if you do not have therapy (maps) you cannot find direction.As you are a ship you will never get to be on land and return to the docks.
You must fix your rudder,you must find all parts to your map and piece them together,you must make the interior of your ship seaworthy (caring for yourself).
Then you can be repaired so you can anchor yourself to shore. A safe ship

I was diagnosed with depression  about 8 years ago. I'm not on any medication and manage most of the time to keep things in check but then something happens and everything seems against me.
I have only 2 people i call friend so loneliness is a massive problem too. I haven't told either that I have depression and anxiety, who whats a friend with mental health problems??
Im to shy and anxious to head out and meet people which compounds the problem.
I use alcohol to ""help"" which we all know it doesn't but that is a difficult cycle to break as it stops the negative thoughts and kills time. 
Anyone have any suggestions how to handle the loneliness? any support groups out there for that??

Around two and a half years ago I went through a really really rough patch with my mental health. My anxiety was at an all time high and I started to fall into a really bad depression. I ended up discussing this with my parents and ended up seeing a doctor, psychologist and a psychiatrist and went on an antidepressant. Through the medication and the counselling I received, I slowly began to feel better and eventually made it past the dark depressing time, however the anxiety stayed with me as it always has been, ever since I was a kid.
I'm now 18 and recently my anxiety has increased again to intense paranoia and stress and I've started to feel more and more down, unmotivated, sad, irritated, aggravated and just downright depressed. Going through this last time was the hardest thing I've ever gone through and I really don't think I can do it again. It took so much out of me and my family as I could tell how much of an impact what I was going through was having them. It's getting so bad that I can't sleep, nothing cheers me up and I can't go 2 hours without crying and I just don't know what to do. I just can't do it all again, and I need some advice on whether I need to just pull myself together and tell my mum it's happening again and take myself to a doctor or something because I seriously need help ans I know I need help, it's just so hard to get up and go get it this time because I just can't see myself going through all this again it just takes everything out of me to even think about the process it was last time and the strength it took

Hi. Newbie here. Diagnosed with depression 3 yrs ago after being laid off work after 25 yrs. Really affecting marriage now. Tonight she told me that i have to sleep in the shed as she needs her space. Says im a bad influence on our 20 and 10 year olds. Am at a crossroads now.  I have not drank for over 30 years now but am considering turning to it to dull the torment. Meds do zilch. No one i can talk to without fear of judgement. Worst part is, is that u helped her through her depression through her menopause etc. For me now its either boozing or death.

Hello. I've been feeling bad for a while now. I can't get myself to do anything, and it feels like I'm just trying to kill time until i can sleep again. While I sleep early, and wake up around 8:30 or 9:30 I cannot find the motivation to get myself out of bed until 12 sometimes 1pm. Then I proceed to spend the day lazing around. Nothing is getting done and this is basically how the last two years have gone. Except instead of lazing around I'd take naps. And do no work, and fail subjects. My head constantly feels hazy and I can't seem to concentrate long enough to do anything, let alone form coherent thoughts for essays. I just feel scattered and overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. Although very debilitating, that's not even the most alarming part. I don't feel anything toward anyone, I don't care about anyone but myself. And I'm confused because most of the time it feels like I can't feel a thing, and at others I can't stop crying. 
I've been trying to fix my erratic sleep patterns, but lack of motivation prevents me getting out of bed even when I'm well rested. Diet isn't that great either as I have no appetite. I exercise everyday.. and I'm not sure whether it's a good thing that I'm withdrawing from friends for a bit because conversations feel meaningless and I don't know what to say at all/it feels fake (social anxiety is also a bit of an issue) or whether I should force myself to get out there more. I'm a very private person, and don't feel close to anyone. I see a psychologist but I'm not sure if it's helping, and I've considered meds but I'm wary of the flat lining effect, especially when I already don't feel much. I have hobbies but I can't muster the motivation to do it or the energy to force myself to. Sorry for the illogical-ness of this all. In all honesty, I'm just very tired.

I'll start by saying I've been on various medications since '96, seen several psychologists & haven't made much headway in the grand scheme of things.
Life's been a battle most of the time, however this is a new low I wouldn't wish on anyone.
Two weeks ago my girlfriend of five years informed me the relationship was over. This came completely out of the blue. Sure, we'd had a bit of a hard time lately, like most couples but I had no idea things were this bad. Personally I think the reason given for ending it is bullshit but there's no point in pushing for a truth, as it won't happen.
Not the first long term relationship I've been through, married & divorced twice so I know the drill.
Now have to deal with finding a place to live which is always fun.
Thing is, I don't have a friend in the world to lean on, never have! Goes back to the way I was raised, the Oldman always said ""Trust no one, keep your thoughts & feelings to yourself, they'll only be used against you!"" Of course I discovered after his death 25yrs ago he didn't practice what he preached!
Yeah, great advice I know now but in my formative years this is what I believed.
Mum's still alive but at 85, I don't like bothering her with all this crap. Sure we talk about what's happening but not the details of how it's affecting me really.
At the moment I'm feeling so alone & wondering what's next to go belly up!
Job loss, won't find a place to live that accepts pets -have three cats- these are the things that have manifested themselves into huge issues.
Employed as a casual for ten months on a 38hr week, I feel the hammer is poised above me, about to drop. There's no real reason for this, just how my mind is spinning at present.
It's at a point where I'm not sleeping, eating, I'm feeling sick & dry reaching, crying, just a shitful mess & honestly, I hate myself.
Not sure what I hope to achieve from posting? 
Ideas on how to deal with things, sympathetic ear, scorn, I really don't know?
I'd head off to another psych but I'm not sure how things are going to pan out financially in a place on my own, so trying to keep a little aside & of the four I've seen previously, only one was of any help I feel. That was twelve years ago & I have no idea if he's still practicing. 
So, laid bare for all the world to see.
To talk about, laugh at, poke fun at, as it's always been.

Hi Everyone, this is my first post here, so please bare with me. About a year ago I presented at the Dr's with a list of symptoms, muscle pain, extreme exhaustion, insomnia, just general feelings of not feeling well. I requested full blood work to be completed, this returned to be low iron but all else looked good. The Dr and I had a long chat and she did approach gently with me the topic of depression and suggested anti depressants. I was well taken aback and slightly offended, thinking, I am sick here, do your job Dr. I left my Dr who is an excellent Dr, just shaking my head in denial. Nearly a year later just prior to Christmas this year I presented at a different surgery with very similar symptoms just slightly worse to be honest. I wake up tired, my whole body feels in pain, I cannot deal physically with the energy my 4 year old daughter gives, I can manage to run the house with my husbands 4 weeks on 4 weeks off FIFO roster. So the different Dr ran a full series of blood work, still low in iron and we too had a discussion. He then also talked about depression with me and wrote me a prescription for antidepressants. This time I have listened. Two different Dr's, two different surgeries, same result. I don't really want to believe it, I don't feel sad, I just don't understand. I want help, I want to feel better, I want my life  back. I need to be a better Mum a better wife. Thanks for listening.

Despite knowing the good intentions those around me have, I always feel alone and empty at the end of the day. Sometimes I feel jealous and spiteful of those who are loved and love others. It doesn't feel like I have that ability, that right. People stray away from me all the time, I lose people and I gain them. But I'm never happy with anything I have and I don't know what to do by this point. 
My sadness goes beyond words and I've felt this way for as long as I can remember.
What should I do?

Hi.
This is my first post.
My situation is that my wife of 33 years has told me she thinks that she wants to seperate and, although she loves and cares for me she feels no affection.I still adore her.
I have had a breakdown and am on medication and it only works half time. I have an appointment with a psychologist but not for another 2 weeks, but have been using all the material that I can get hold of.
Yesterday I had a number of black out moments that my wife thought was sleep walking. I was talking to myself and gave her a massage in the middle of the night, none of which I remember. I did take a sedative as well and have had bad experiences with it in tbe past.
Last night I read an email to a male friend that I have jealousy issues over and felt there was something going on. There wasn't. I immediately regretted what I did and told her about it.
She has not reacted with anger but we havn't spoken any more about it.
It has been 3 weeks since my breakdown and I have put a lot of things in place that I think will help but it just seems like I take 1 step forward and start to feel better and next thing I am back to where I started from, in tears and shaking etc.
I have not been physically violent with her but I tend to not talk for weeks in the past.
I hope to become a better person with treatment and address all of my past but I have never felt like this before.
Any advice from people as to what I can do that has helped you out I would really appreciate.
Thank you all in advance

Hi, Ive decided on joining here for some help, advice as Im at a loss.  I cant cope with day to day life I feel like I just exist.  I cant handle any sort of pressure nor the question how are you today I just dont want to answer.
Ive been to the doctor which took a lot of courage, after explaining the sleepless nights, the worrying, feeling like a failure, and all I got was a list fo questions to answer, told i have depression and told to take St. John Worts tablets which in turn gave me a reaction whereby my face swelled up and now its taken 5 days to recover from that.  
All I want to do is cry I don't know what to do, i don't want to see a therapist but I do want help. 
Im so jealous to see people happy I want to be like that and no matter how I try I just cant nothing makes me happy :(
I want to go and see another doctor but the I dont want to go through those questions they ask again and again it makes me feel worse and stupid.
I cant believe im even here typing this feel stupid doing this too but what do you do.

I have read that our life expectancy is shortened for Bipolar and Depression, an average of 12 years according to some studies. Has anyone been involved with any research into this. Would apprecite feed back...

ive never reached out for help in my life and as far as most people know im fine, but i havent been fine in years. i dont know how to explain my constant sadness. the amount of times ive rewrote this is incredible. i want to give up on writing this but im really pushing myself to make a change and this is just my attempt to just say im really not doing well, im feeling very emotional right now and it feels really great to be able to say that im not okay and to get this out of my head even if its just some silly forum. thank you

I don't know where else to turn. I'm stuck. I thought I was in love, but now I'm not sure. I left everything behind to be with him, friends, family. Now the passions gone and now I'm just scared. 
I'm 18, I work in fast food, I just left my dads, just graduated. I don't know what I'm doing. I shouldn't have left home. I resent him for asking me to live with him. 
 Everything he says makes me so angry now. But then my coldness gets too much, he cries and I feel like I'm in love again. What is wrong with me? I swear I love him it's just not constant. This doesn't feel right. It's not fair to him. 
I want to be better to him. But I get so angry. I hate myself for it, and he hates himself for it too. The medication isn't helping I still feel wrong. Please tell me what to do. I need him. I don't want to keep hurting him. I'm sorry.

Hi everyone. First post and looking for a forum I can get some idea on how people are coping with choosing not to take mood stabilising meds. I have Bipolar 2 and decided I don't want to take meds. Quick history - After twenty years on an antidepressant for OCD I decided to come off them and see how I would cope. Three months into no meds, numerous moods swings of hypermania and depression I have been diagnosed as BP2.
It's been an exhausting period getting use to these changes but I want to try to do this with out meds. I have a wonderful husband who supports me and a close friend I can be totally truthful with. Their support comes with no judgement and is a safe place for me to swing about through theses moods like a monkey on a branch.
I am seeing a psychologist fortnightly, refuse to go back to the psychiatrist who treated me like an idiot and a GP who is supportive of my decision to go med free, although I don't go to see her that often.
I write A LOT and my journal is my mood diary. Scary at times to read over how the shifts effect me but my mantra these days is ""it is what it is"".
I try to visualise middle ground when I feel my moods lifting too high or plunging too low. So far the swings are manageable but not without my team. I am ultra aware not to fatigue them but not being in control of the changes scares me it could happen.

Hey everyone. I'm really struggling with work depression. When I'm unemployed I'm so depressed and want a job so bad! Now I have a job, and before going I am so depressed, unmotivated and nearly just stay home and risk losing to job. Like it's really bad and I end up going and after the first hour I start feeling a little better but what I'm struggling with is The before part. Everyone else in the world works for a living and I feel so pathetic feeling this way. My last job I felt the same and I left without notice and never went back because that's how bad it was. Everyone is really nice and welcoming at work, there is nothing wrong at work that makes me not want to go, can anyone shed some light on why I'm feeling this way and tips to improve this feeling? Thanks xx

For my short 26 years thus far I've done allot. I've survived allot and I've improved allot.
Despite my achievements this far, who I am as a person, I can't shake and have never been able to shake a constant feeling of brokenness, worthlessness and inferiority. I have bipolar disorder as well, but that's been tamed with medication.
I do allot with my life these days, I work two jobs one full time, I'm working to get into a career. I indulge in hobbies, keep active and eat well.
Most of my self improvement hasn't been anything people care much about. My hobbies and interests are uninteresting to most, which isolates me a bit. I'm not your typical person on the surface, I'm a 6ft skinny transsexual woman covered in tattoos and piercings with 1/3 of my head shaved...most of the things I'm interested in are communities that don't like people like me. So I just quietly enjoy them alone.
I don't really like the queer community, there are some wonderful people in it but there's allot of toxicity and negativity in it too, which I'd rather avoid, I usually feel inferior to everyone in it too. My wife is trans as well, so is my girlfriend, both suffer from mental illness and when they speak of feelings of self hatred I can't see the negativity they see in themselves. I imagine that's how they see me, but I can't believe the positive things they say about me, I'd like to, but to me none of it's true.
I've seen allot of therapists etc, most I've found boorish, nothing personal, but they come across as useless. Which is probably my fault for not engaging them.
Dysphoria (the feeling of disconnect between identified sex and physical sex) plays into the feelings of worthlessness and inferiority too. Despite medically transitioning with medication and having wonderful results objectively, I can't help but feel ugly, grotesque, physically useless, physically undesirable and inferior in every way to every other trans girl I meet see or hear of. To me I'm just worthless physically on all levels. I can't understand why my wife or girlfriend see any beauty in me, again, in my mind, they're wrong.
 
My work always feels inferior, imperfect and worthless despite how treasured some of my work is. All in all I just feel like a worthless pile of rotting flesh. This depression has caused me to lose every friend I've ever had, I have my wife and girlfriend, but no friends. I'm too much of a sorry sad sack to have friends and in time, I fully expect my wife and girlfriend to leave me.

I feel numb nearly all the time or as if I’m not enough I’m never enough and I can never to anything. I know I should tell someone but because of my age they’ll write it off as “teenage moodiness” or “hormones”they didn’t take me seriously when I came out either, they just acted nice but never did anything when I brought it up. I know that feeling like this so often is bad, I know my lifestyle (oversleeping, not eating well, not socialising or doing exercise) is bad but I can’t change it not without help at least, but I know they won’t do anything if I tell them, I’m stagnating like a packet of crisps on a roof.

Hello
today I confronted a process that commenced over 6 years ago with the diagnosis of my late wife with terminal cancer, since then I have been on a roller coaster of emotions all of which have been linked to a depressive state. I guess it commenced when we found out that there was nothing that could be done.... at the time I chose to work as we went through our journey and during that time it seems I was not of sound mind as I chose to trust colleagues to have my back, turns out the trust was misplaced and I am now faced with personal and financial ruin...... what’s the point?

I've struggled with depression near 20yr (since late teens). Have major depression and family history of BPD. I am totally exhausted keeping up the effort. I used to have a high paying job (gone), very few prospects now. Finances are shattered, have poured tons into psychiatry, now can't afford further consultation. Empty inside, feel very little toward others, just numb and dull on inside, it's like the light has been turned off. The meds don't work, I used to drink to self med until crashing early in the year - haven't touched that stuff for 10months. Every day I feel lower and use my tools to realize what I have, I will keep persisting but to what end. I guess I just wanted to put something down as I don't sleep well, sit here reading forums and know that there's many that don't post... best of luck all of you with the battle!

I have posted about jobs and whats best for us that suffer mentally before and i have been given some valuable advice from lots of you.
I just have a few more questions and that is, anyone on here hold a full time job and suffer mentally, what jobs are they, how do you cope etc?
I had been given advice to have 2 jobs and that is going okay although i still get bad anxiety on the days i work as the bosses are rude and cause drama. I try to keep away from it as much as i can.
Although this is okay for now, theres no security as they are casual, and i feel like i am not getting anywhere.
I want a career and all i can think of is jobs that are helping people, but i know that nursing and jobs like that will be too much for me.
I dont even know if i can hold a full time job, i have tried multiple times and just end up not coming to work anymore.
Any experiences you guys have that are work related please share what worked for you.

Hi
I sit at home and read alot on here.  It amazes me how much help we all get.
Last year just before Christmas I had my family go through their clothes and my son grabbed a heap of toys, bikes and skateboards he'd grown out of. We packed the car up and went to the local community centre where they also have emergency accommodation for people.
It was easy finding things even nice jewelry I'd brought online and never worn to donate.
This year though like most money is tight we are still going to do the same.  People in our area give away free bikes etc either beside the road or on gumtree.
Knowing in some small way that come Christmas just a bit of a smile will be on a person' face leaves a happy feeling inside.
Even school shoes or runners my son grows out of can mean a parent struggling doesn't have to find the extra money and can ease the burden.

More often than not I suffer from low level depression. Not bad enough that I cant get out of bed, however its bad enough that I don't really care about myself that much. Let me explain..
I feel like I do things because I have to not because I want to. I only want to be here because I have family. I feel like I wouldn't care if I was here or not if I didn't have them. Its always an effort to work, keep fit, keep up my hobbies. I only work a few days a week but I am a full time parent. Work and hobbies are things I have to do to help me stay well, its not that I really care about them that much. In fact I hate my job. I don't have the academic ability, money or dedication to go onto something better. I wish I could get excited about life. I have been excited (rarely) about my hobbies but then reality sinks in that I'm actually talentless and find it difficult to remember and or retain information. I'm lucky that my teenage kids are pretty good and doing well. If they were not I would not cope. Every day is mental preparation and planning so I can get through it. I pretend I'm happy when I'm around people. I distract myself at home, sometimes it works, sometimes not. I do take anti depressants. I was diagnosed with bipolar when I was 37. 10 years ago. I feel like I'm just here with a heart beat.

Hi, 
i have bipolar, ADHD (and possibly Aspergers), but since a relationship break up two and a half years ago I've been depressed. I think for the most part I am over the relationship break up and betrayal now. 
The depression overwhelms me. The reason I stay alive is for my family and friends. I feel I am dragging down my family and friends with my sadness.  I am lucky a lot of people love me. I live with my parents who are retired. I have no job, am on DSP, and I am ashamed of that. Most days I stay in bed till the afternoon then drag myself out of bed to watch tv with my parents. I know life can't continue like this but I am not sure what else to do. I am stuck. 
I have just started seeing a new psychiatrist (4 in two and a half years one died, one quit, one didn't understand) and I am going to change my psychologist this week because the last one could only see me once every two months.
 The last six days I haven't left the house except to feed my neighbours pets while they were away. 
Thanks for reading

So I first want to start off by
saying that I'm currently a 3rd year PhD student focusing on molecular biology.
I only bring this up because its relevant to how I feel about myself.
I'm
a big believer in thinking that who I am is a result of my gene-environment
interactions, i.e. nature and nurture. I have very little doubt about this, as
it explains why there is so much variation in human behaviour and what some might
find acceptable and others abhorrent and why some choose to do art and others
business. I think this is a good thing as diversity in thought is a good way
for the best ideas to compete and win. I also strongly believe that as a unique
society, there are certain genetic traits that allow for higher levels of
success and enjoyment of life and that brings me to how I feel about
myself. 
There
are clearly certain people who are ""better"" at life than others. We
often describe these people as role models, people that work hard, are more
resilient, kind, compassionate, intelligent etc. I only say this as I want to
demonstrate that their are ""ideal"" traits to have. At the same time,
we don't wan't too much of any one trait. Being too kind will not allow us to tell
people hard truths or will simply allow others to take advantage of us. And
if we are comfortable making this assumption about “better” people we have to
then make the assumption that there is another end to the spectrum.  
I’ve
had depression for close to a decade starting from high school. Although I could
blame the other kids, teachers or whoever, theres a reason I (and others) can
be singled out. We’re different. Maybe different looking, different thinking, or
we simply aren’t that great at socialising. For myself, my depression started
with the clear examples id see everyday of how others could socialise and not
become victims to bullying. Although this affects me less so now, I feel a
growing collection of what I see as negative traits within myself bearing down
on me. Although I can point to some goods things in myself, I feel that what I was,
I currently am and will be will not result in a happy life. I’ve gotten to a
point that I feel confident knowing who I am, at the same time it demonstrates to
myself that I won’t ever be happy with my life especially like some other
people I know.
I’m not really sure what I’m expecting
to get out of this as I don’t normally get any relief from talking about my
issues. But I’m at a point where I feel disabled by my thoughts and need help.

Hi all,
I am a new member here and just wanted to ask if anyone who suffers with depression ever gets malaise? 'Malaise' is not a very specific term but in my case I get an overall 'sick' feeling without actually having a flu, a discomfort in my body, it almost feels as if I am poisoned, it is the worst feeling and makes it hard to function at all. No matter what methods I try or what supplements I take it does not relieve this feeling. I have not taken anti depressants because I believe I can beat it naturally and I do not like all the side effects from them. I have started taking CBD oil and it has helped but doesn't relieve the malaise. I should also mention I got very sick 4 months ago with ross river virus, this is what kicked off the worsening depression and anxiety. It is very hard for me to distinguish whether depression is causing malaise or it is post viral malaise, it is hard to believe that depression could cause this feeling but I can't rule it out as I know I am depressed. I am new to depression and anxiety so it has been a learning curve to try and understand it and deal with it. Any info would be much appreciated.

I guess it all started from school, I've been bullied and rejected quite harshly through high school, and in general just disrespected. I hated it so much, I just want to be normal I guess, just have some chill friends to hang out with who aren't mean to me. I'm currently on a gap year because I am planning on taking a pretty intensive course  and My anxiety and depression had gotten so severe that I knew I wouldn't be able to function. I've tried stuff like meetups, volunteer work and I also have a job now, but it all seems so hopeless. Nothing worked, there were pretty much nobody my age to talk to. I keep getting thoughts to do with all the bullying and stuff and its just irritating. I try to gain control and get some semblance of happiness from playing music, but its very difficult to sustain, but I do enjoy it very much. I'm not sure what to do at this point, besides waiting for uni and hoping that people aren't as mean to me as in the past, but I can't bring myself to do it, it just seems so hopeless :/.

Hi all,
I know I tend to ask similar questions on here, but I'd love to know if anyone knows how to stem the tide of depression, self loathing, early on when it begins? I tend to see it coming days/weeks before and know what it is, but that knowledge doesn't help to stop it.
Ive tried exercise, being kind to myself, positive thinking, avoiding sad songs (clutching at straws I know!) but it seems to be inevitable. The pain comes and huts hard and nothing short of riding it out over weeks/months/more seems to help.
Its too late this time, it is already all-encompassing, but for next time: surely there's something I can do early on to stop/slow it? 
Thanks so much, x

Hi all,
It's been a long time since I've posted, lots of big changes over the last 18 months.  Over the past 6 months we've had a series of bad news with family members' and friends' serious health issues and many other stresses.  In saying this, there has been lots of good things happen too.  The thing I have noticed just recently is that it seems I'm beginning to enter menopause, with hot flushes, cycle changes, etc.  
I already manage long term depression and anxiety, so everything seems heightened, along with a feeling of physical and mental exhaustion.  I'm struggling dealing with the physical & emotional aspects of this new 'stage', along with the usual management of my mental health.  I used to exercise regularly, but a minor knee injury and subsequent surgery with ongoing chronic referral pain has slowed me down.  With Christmas just around the corner, I can't seem to get into the spirit either, and just find I'm dragging my feet, wishing I could just put the brakes on and curl up in bed.
Anyone else having similar entering menopause experiences?
Thanks

Hello Everyone! and any new posters too!
Having had depression and anxiety for over 30 years explaining the illness whether to a boss, partner or family member can be difficult. I have seen numerous people post desperate to find a way to explain it to people that just don't understand.  Even worse is explaining depression to 
ignorant people that think we should just 'snap out of it' and 'move forward' 
I have a couple that have worked

In Business When I have had a boss that has a closed mind I have told them 'its like claustrophobia without the closed in spaces'
Family Member non believer. I have explained it as 'Diabetes of the Brain' as there is a chemical link. 'Invisible Crutches' also works

A Community Champion on the forums mentioned to copy the info under 'The Facts' (or Supporting Someone with depression) print it and provide a copy to the person that is trying but cant understand depression. A fabulous idea!
Lastly we have the people that tell us to 'snap out of it' and wont listen or even try to understand....I find communicating the following to them can 'wake them up'..............
'Depression is a serious illness........just like diabetes or heart disease 
Expecting positive thinking to cure depression is like expecting a person with diabetes to lower their blood sugar level by thinking happy thoughts'

The name (noun) of this illness 'depression' is a failure of the english language as we know it. The illness is badly named, inaccurate and gives no justice to the severity of the illness and its symptoms.
There are many people that read the Beyond Blue Forums and choose not to post which is fine. There are also many people on the forums that may find your advice beneficial too! If you have any ways of 'Explaining depression' when people give you that 'there is really nothing wrong with you look' please do share any knowledge or advice so we can help others find some peace in their lives
Thankyou for reading my post :-)
Kind Thoughts
Paul

Hi Dools for given me the inspiration to post a thread. 30years ago started experiencing anxiety and depression, I find anxiety symptoms worse. Through determination I became a mental health nurse and my main goal was to help others, over the years I developed PTSD symptoms. I have been relatively stable over the years until the last 6 months, my husband had an agitated depression which resulted in hospital admission. He has become a stranger to me and our children and we are trying to support him however I have found that I have become depressed however the anxiety is bad. He is progressively getting better and I feel I am struggling with my mental health

Hi everyone. First time poster so Hai. 
Im gonna get straight to it. Ive been battling pretty strong depression and anxiety for a couple of years now. The biggest concern I have is how much this is impacting my job. I also have a fair amount of debt. 
I have a good job that pays very well the problem is I haven't been for the last 2 weeks and I'm only new at this place. My depression has hit me so hard I can barely get out of bed. I feel like a husk of a person. I've started a new medication thanks to my GP whom I know well and trust. But it's taking a while to kick in and I'm not functioning in the mean time. 
Im scared I'll lose my job and wind up with a stack of debt that can't be paid. I'll lose my car etc. My new employer is a bit miffed. I've tried to be as transparent as I can to keep them on side but I don't know how long it can last. 
Thanks
Tim.

Has anyone experienced vertigo as part of anxiety and/or depressive episodes?  I have recently been diagnosed with Cervical Vertigo hand in hand with a major depression episode and I am wondering if there is a link between the two conditions.

Im not Australian and neither is my husband. He’s been living in Australia for 6 years now. We got married in our country and i moved to Australia. My husband goes to work, coming back home at 6:30ish. During the day im always alone i know no one here and i cant find a job. I deeply miss my family, my friends and my life. I cant cope, i cant get used to living alone. im about to explode out of  loneliness. I dont have any power, will or energy to do anything. Everything i do is because i have to not because i want to. This has deeply affected my life and my relationship with my husband. I don’t usually express my feelings so its only translated into anger. Life here is soo much different than it is in my country. I feel lost and helpless and i think im going through depression.
thanks.

Hi, my name is Zac and I have depression. Recently my long time girlfriend and I split up due to her being unfaithful and I have not handled it well. It was a very happy relationship and due to this I have stayed very close friends with her. However the breakup has had a large impact on my life and lifestyle. I lived with my girlfriend for close to a year and due to us splitting up I have had to move back home. This wasn't an issue as my parents welcomed me back straight away and had a room ready for me. Although they haven't said anything to me and they keep assuring me that it's ok, I can tell that me moving back into home has been a struggle for them. Due to us being a moderate to low income family, My presence has meant them spending more money in order to support me aswell. Things such as food, hygiene supplies etc have had a bit of an impact on the amount of money spent each week. Although I offer to buy my own food and supplies, they keep assuring me it'll be ok for them. This has had a large impact on my mental health as constantly I feel like i'm such a burden to have in the house, and I feel so bad and sorry for them that all of a sudden I've moved back in and they have had to adjust their lifestyle. Often at night I can't sleep because I feel so bad for them and this has a large impact on me constantly being sad. Due to this, I have lately been buying fast food as an alternative to my parents cooking food for me. In the last month or so, I've noticed a weight gain and this is starting to upset me, and I also have a lack of motivation to go the gym which i used to go on a daily regular basis. Another thing Is that I have all motivation to do anything. Simple things such as going to the shops for example. I don't want to leave my house, I don't want to speak to anybody or do anything, and I dread going to work. When I am at work I'm just as miserable there. I don't know what to do. I went and spoke to a GP who then referred me to go speak to someone at a local mental health clinic, But I found the one on one interaction a little awkward and wasn't sure what to say. It's rare for a day where I don't end up crying. I constantly think about what my girlfriend did to me and I always blame myself for not being better, even though she herself has told me this isn't the case. I'm just constantly sad now 24/7. I'm not suicidal or ever have been, I'm just over being constantly sad. I'm sorry but I just need some help

Hey :)

I think it's important for people, everyone to know what struggles there are with MI & any issues that people go through for hopefully understanding & support. Could create more tolerance in society. We NEED a voice

Hoping people would like to contribute here to what you have to deal with for understanding & learning.

I'm Bipolar, done a fair whack of research & deep thought. I believe with want & determination this can be beaten, worse scenario getting emotional control which I think although mammoth is the key to our survival and reaching peace from the beast.(Depression) 

Diagnosed Type 1 & 2. There's others (later)
Type 1- more likely not necessarily to have visual & auditory hallucinations, grand deur, delusions. The highs (mania) are very high.
Type 2 - slightly elevated mood (mania, but OH SOOOO GOOD too) There's more depression Deep, recently heard there's far more suicide attempts than any other MI with BP (Bipolar, or BPD - Disorder & heard from Psychiatrist too staggering, something like 6 in 10 people attempt. The downs are horrific. Absolute HELL as most here understand that pain. I attempted in teens 4 times and really wanted out. Clearly failed :) & glad I did, since loss of partner recently has been an option but now outta equation, I'm gunna get this, pulled me down all life. Many people get it around teens yrs or common later in life. Stress induced?
Some can have one episode in their life and be BP. I'm more than a rapid cycler that is 4 or more a yr. I have 8-10 major cycles (episodes) 

MANIA: BLOODY MAGIC!!! You feel sooo damned good, pure utter happiness, confidence, self assured, promiscuity, erratic over spending,reckless,ideas flood with such clarity, your mind keeps up at rapid pace, unbelievable (moreso super fast in type 1), projects, belief, energy, motivation, determined, ALL tools for success, but think the brain knows it can't keep pace up for long is why it all slams at once, OH & sleep, nah can do so many all niters without and booming with energy, I get some never enough through meds. NO BODY ON THIS EARTH DOESN""T WANNA FEEL THIS WAY, Gift from God with devils pricetag. 
DEPRESSION: For most it's heavy & before cycles, I get both worse on coming down, WOW, complete opposite. DEEP as. So hard to cope, the exhaustion from it all is mighty, use to hit the wall and it'd keep pushing but got highs down over yrs but still takes wks for recovery.

More to say but later. 

Thx 4 time/listening & contributing if so :)

hi am currently in the grips of bipolar depression, i have been at rock bottom for 8 months, had three medication changes, was hospitalised for two weeks and am currently on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist to see about changing medications yet again as my current combination is having zero effect. i am exhausted and feeling like the path to wellness is nowhere in sight, i'm afraid to change medications as it was a change in medication landed me in hospital, but i must try as i can not exist in my current state....the depression is all encompassing and relentless.....im struggling to stay afloat, feel like i have lost my mind. desperate for relief the constant pain is unbearable,  everything takes so long and there are no guarantees.....i hope so bad i find a doctor that can help me, who can find a medication combination that can give me my life back, im so tired of hanging on by a thread i want to live.............

Hi all, this is my first post and the first time ive really spoken about what im going though and would appreciate and advice you can give.
7 Months ago i was forced out of a job i loved and had been in for a decade, since then ive been in another job that i detest, the boss is just not a nice person, belittles staff at every turn and i am suffering severe depression and anxiety now, i wake up and shudder at the thought of going to work, the work load is too much, its a 2 person job and more often than not its just me.
I have a heart condition and a few weeks ago i was in hospital for a related scare, luckliy nothing came of it and i was given clean bill of health, my boss rang every day to ask when i would be back and the other staff have told me he was whinging about me not being in and putting me down while i was off.
Everytime the boss walks in he focuses on a negative, never mind that my hours at 7am to 5pm, i start getting calls from drivers (im in transport operations) at 5am and they dont stop until 9pm, im at my wits end and am constantly on the verge of walking out but with bills, xmas and a family holiday coming up i just cant afford to leave but feel like i need to to keep my sanity.
What should i do, i just keep saying just get through till Xmas and then 3 weeks later your holiday and then come back fresh and find something else but i dont know if i can last that long, im really struggling................need help and thats hard for me to ask for!

Hi all,
I have found this forum at 1am after a very difficult day. I have a baby who is one month old. The pregnancy was very difficult and I struggled to keep on top of my anxiety during it. I went on my antidepressants six weeks before he birth as my mood was deteriorating rapidly.
during the pregnancy my partner’s job was uncertain and this along with other issues caused us both stress. Our relationship is very solid but it took a toll both of us and I felt quite lonely for parts of my pregnancy. 
my partner is overall very supportive, I have the sort of relationship and support most people could only dream of. We had a big argument a couple of weeks after the baby was born when I was already struggling and I just feel like it was the straw that broke the camel’s back for me. Sometimes I feel so sad and hurt that I just want so desperately to numb the pain and think a lot about just getting blind drunk so I stop feeling so sad and hurt and let down. I don’t do this because I have two young children and want more than anything to just be a great mother to them. I just find the thought of wishing I could get drunk and wipe myself out so I didn’t feel so sad anymore comes up more often than I’d like. I keep picturing myself going out to the pub and getting wasted while leaving my children at home with my partner and that image makes me feel like a terrible mother. 
my bond with my oldest is very strong. I love my new baby, but sometimes I worry I am not bonding with her the way I should. I think that perhaps I am just being paranoid as I am so afraid of getting PND that I am looking for signs everywhere. I keep reminding myself that I’ve had years to bond with my oldest and that my bond will strengthen over time with my youngest and I do and say all the things with my baby i did for my first. Maybe it just feels a bit different the second time around when you have a toddler to look after and you can’t give as much time to your baby as you could when you didn’t have another kid. 
All I want is to feel ok, and even though everything is technically ok with my life I just can’t shake this feeling that something isn’t right and is just ‘off’, yet I can’t put my finger on it. I am thinking that perhaps the big argument I had with my partner a couple of weeks ago is maybe the main reason I feel like this, but just keep worrying that I will get PND and that I am not connecting with my baby as I’m supposed to.

First time poster so will see how this goes. I've had a girlfriend for 8 months now and we're as close as ever, things have moved quickly. She recently moved to start her new job, only 45 mins away. Works 9-5:30 I work 2pm til midnight. Communication has become the main issue for us. Anyway it was only 2 days ago that I woke up and it was like my mind had done a backflip. To the point where I told her I didn't wanna leave my job to go live with her even though we'd spoken about it numerous times. I couldn't even tell her I loved her. Never had this happen before. I've had a sick feeling ever since and I feel like I've ruined something that was so perfect. I'm not exactly sure what switched. But I just feel horrible hurting someone I love and care about. Just not sure how to rectify it. I'm feeling so overwhelmed by it all. 
Thanks for taking the time to read

I was harassed by a customer at work 3 years ago and it has ruined my relationship with my boyfriend, friends and family & my life. I’ve been doing pretty well for the last 10 months but recently I’m REALLY struggling. I work in a male dominated industry and it hasn’t been too bad for a while but the only other female I worked with has recently left and now I am the main target for all the (mostly older) men.
Im feeling lately that I need to quit my job but there are no available positions in my town that would suit me and I need to pay my bills.
Ive spoken to my boss and keep him posted on everything that happens/is said but this doesn’t help with the cyclone in my head.
Ive tried therapy before and never found this very helpful.
Im lost at what to do.

Hi,
I’m very new to this and I’m very nervous. I can’t pinpoint the moment or time I knew I wasn’t so well anymore or started feeling down more than I felt good and happy. 
I believe my issue stems from this: when I used to think about my life at this age and stage, it looked nothing like what my life is today. And for this reason I feel like I can’t make peace with myself, like I’m not accepting of myself because I’ve failed myself and nothing good has come of my life. I get upset quite easily and very anxious. I worry about things constantly, and they are usually things I can’t control or predict and for some crazy reason, that terrifies me. I also suffer from social anxiety as when I’m out I always feeling like people are looking at me, watching me and judging me. My sunnies are always plastered on top of my head so that I can put them on and become invisible, in my mind. 
I have seeked online help and completed a mental health assessment which resulted in mild depression, moderate general and social anxiety. 
Can anyone offer resources that may help me in understanding these things more? 
 thank you.

Hi, have had severe depression and anxiety over past few years. Been getting worse lately. Over time, I have tried numerous counsellors/psychologists, inpatient/outpatient psychiatrists, many antidepressants, TMS, hospital admissions, recommended ECT but declined. Also have physical health issues that have resulted in multiple referrals/appointments over the past couple of years. GP put everything down to depression years ago but it wasnt just that. Even the current diagnosis leaves things up in the air, and have been told it may or may not progress in future and appointments come as symptoms change. I have previously been a very fit, healthy, active, private and independent person, so its all hit pretty hard.
I work casually now in a low-key job, but had to speak to boss recently about cutting back days as just not coping at all with the overall load of work/home. Got emotional, now fear prejudice. Work was one place I was safe to keep on my mask and not feel questioned or judged as nobody knew..but now I have let my guard down and many saw it happen.
I have 3 kids. Finding it really hard as just want to be alone. My husband and I have been having issues, he has been speaking to his family about our issues, so they side with him and now dont speak to me. His dad even told him to move on with his life. Tears my heart out as I have done nothing wrong except fight every day against all odds - quick to judge when he has no idea what I have/am going through and have always tried to be there for them. I asked him not to speak to his family because I knew they would side with him - I had asked him to speak to a third party who would be mutual/not take sides if he needed to talk.  He had an affair a couple of years ago, but vows hasnt done anything since. Not sure if I believe that. 
My family are not a very open family and we dont see each other much. Friends tend to be school mums whose children are friends with mine. A couple know the depth of whats happened but very much have the 'pull your socks up' demeanour and avoid me except for arranging kids stuff. Dont feel able to search out new friends or activities.
Hard to feel hope when even my GP, psychologists and psych have all pretty much said they dont know how to help. If they cant, who can? I feel alone, exhausted and empty. I feel like there's nothing left to try. Feel pretty dark some days...all goes round and round like a washing machine. Nothing I do/have done helps anymore. All feels too much to bear

I thought I was being honest by saying I'd had depression. 
It was a medical assessment as the last step before taking the job. I'd already been offered the job (over the phone); my referees had given me a 'glowing report'.
Then, out of the blue, the day after the medical assessment they called to say the job had changed and I wouldn't meet their new criteria. 
(The medial assessment came after two successful interviews, a psychometric test and referee check).
So I've done some research this morning and apparently it's a bad idea to mention this upfront to a potential employer - because despite all the pretence about diversity, it's ultimately about the business bottom line and you're therefore potentially a liability. (Even if the depression was in the past).
In two minds a out whether to confront the HR rep from the company about this but have no idea if it's worth it.

So I have been dating my boyfriend for a year and a half now and at the 6month point I thought he had reached rock bottom and he engaged in some psychology appointments and then just stopped . Things seemed to get better for a bit and now the past three months he’s just spiraling downwards through manic and depressive stages . I thought he may have bipolar disorder but didn’t want to approach him around it as he was no longer willing to engage with psychologist and I came across as naggy around everything . The past two weeks he has been ignoring most of my messages then will arrange something and stand me up .. I got fed up as it has been emotionally drained . I spoke to his best friend last night and he told me that he had been diagnosed in high school with bipolar but refused medication for fear of being uncool and weak and has been 6 years Unmedicated and has turned to alcohol in a bad way lately to solve his problems . Hasn’t been showing up to work and is just pushing away everyone who cares . I honestly am stumped at what to do cause I ultimately can’t do much until he is willing to want to recover and seek help . Has anyone been through a similar experience and have any advice ?

i have been having more and more trouble enjoying anything
i feel so incredibly bored with everything and just don't really care about anything anymore. i am struggling to motivate myself to get up and go to work everyday. my job is boring and i just don't care about it.
i have no idea what i want to do job/career wise and it brings such huge anxiety whenever i think about it as i think i'm too stupid to go to university
anyone else feeling the same?

Hi Everyone,
While replying on a different thread, I came up with this idea due to a comment the person made about ""wanting it all to go away"".
This is a thought I am sure many of us have experienced! It may help if we can express what it is that we want to go away, and than look at ways of dealing with those thoughts, how we can change life to be more beneficial and consider the good things of the day.
I will make a start with my own list of things I'd like to go away:
- waking up in the morning thinking oh bother, here comes another day!
- depression, dizziness, poor concentration, headaches, back ache, neck ache...etc!
- not having employment 
- juggling conversations with a husband who may be on the Autism spectrum but declines to be assessed
- the days are heating up...I'm already looking forward to winter!
- feeling like I need to struggle with my thoughts every day
- uncertainty, wanting to run away frequently 
I know that if I continue to entertain these thoughts, they will just keep on growing into something even more terrible. I can consider ways of making my life better. Starting with one of these issues at a time.
Okay, now any of you have an opportunity to share.
The next step though is to be thankful for something today despite maybe feeling like the day has been less than average.
Today I am thankful for: the laughter I shared with a lady in the Op Shop today. Who knew that folding plastic bags and chatting could be so much fun!
So what do you want to go away today, how can you help to lessen the impact this issue has on you, and list something good from your day.
Cheers all from Dools

Hi there, I am new to this forum so thought I would introduce myself. I have battled mental health issues my whole entire life - chronic anxiety, depression, PTSD and now.. perhaps borderline personality traits. I am 27 years old. I had one acute episode of depression at 17, and we've come full circle now, 10 years on and I am in another acute episode. I recognise it and I feel especially ashamed as I work in a mental health focused profession. Anyway, I thought I would never be back here. But, every minute is an agonising battle to keep on going. I am meeting with my psychiatrist tomorrow to discuss hospitalisation. I am keeping myself safe with no alcohol and I am away from my partner & his family, who for various reasons, had no tolerance of this. They believe you can choose to ""just get over stuff"", and I never make that choice. I keep reading the Sane ""myths & facts"" that depression isn't a choice. Hell, I tell people in my profession, ""depression isn't a choice."" But the shame and guilt remains so fixed and it suffocates me. My sense of myself as an adult has been shattered, and I have lost the trust I had in myself. I am this broken mess. My housing & employment & finances are all up in the air, but problem solving seems impossible when getting through a minute of being inside this head is supremely difficult. I am living with my mother, who at least believes I am not choosing this (mostly). I am so tired and this pain is crushing me. Please tell me - how do you get through this?

I have been a sufferer of depression for a long time as a result from traumatic experiences as a child being bullied. Now at 28 I live a life that most wish they had. Married, daughter, built our home, well paying jobs ... That's at least what people think
I manage to struggle day to day anxiety attacks and feel depressed most of my day. I feel selfish that I hadn't put myself first and tackled this condition but I've lived my life this way forever, I'm use to it and think 'I'll try tomorrow'. Given myself no credit, constantly setting myself high expectations and always putting others before me. My family turn a blind eye, my husband try's to be supportive but he is a go getter and can't truly understand depression, I know he finds it unattractive. My friends/work have no idea how I feel but I have become very unsociable and I get the impression I'm not that fun person to be around anymore. I've been able to keep it for a secret for this long and I'm burning.. I've tried medication and I hated it, I have seen a psychologist and I'm so unstable I can't maintain my visits. Lately, I just want to sleep.. My job is stressful and I emotionally eat and in result I have gained a lot of weight which is a huge contributor to the way I feel/and see myself. How do I overcome not feeling guilty for having 'me' time, how do I even have 'me' without feeling so bored and sad and guilty from being away from my husband and daughter.
It makes me sick that my daughter has an unhealthy mother, I want to be her role model!! And I feel terrible that I'm holding my husband back from life with having such a miserable person to be around.
I need to start changes now before I continue this fake life and have no one left around me..

Hey guys im New to these forums. I'm only posting as I feel I need to talk to someone atm. Ive always had depression since I was a little girl and was always on medication to help it but for the past year and a half I haven't been depressed, I've been able to get it under control. So I came off my meds and actually have been doing so bloody good without the meds and I havent been depressed. Well since Friday that has just passed something happened in my family that I can't really say cause its personal but for the last 3 days I've noticed I've become really sad and its been creeping up on me slowly and just tonight it's hit me like a tonne of bricks. I swear ive cryed since 10 and now it's 12. I'm just really sad. And I havent worked this hard to keep my depression away for it just to come back really quick and hard like this. I hate taking meds as it makes me feel not right not normal. Why can't I be happy without meds? I feel like a bad mummy cause I'm down. This sucks.

I don't know why, but it seems to have gotten worse and worse for me: I studied and finished my bachelor degree in digital media in 2014, but can't seem to get a job with it (I did 2 internships in graphic design, and both said my knowledge was lacking). The course was very artsy, I have no clue how to design a brochure or anything useful .
So, I got a job in retail, and I really enjoyed it! i worked there for 2 years, but things got worse in the 2nd year, as most ppl left because things were unorganized, machines kept breaking down or they got better offers.
Well, even my bf told me to quit, and I did and feel really good about it.
However, I've been taking a month break to find out what I want to do, I don't have money troubles as I saved enough. I just have no clue what I want to do with my life: everything seems crap; I don't want to work in the food industry anymore because I hated that, as well as sales (I just couldn't lie to a customer). I don't mind working as a cashier again, but they all want teenagers and young adults, I'm too old (almost 30).
I wanted to study something else, but I just can't get out of my funk and be passionate about anything anymore...I tried working on a graphic novel but nobody is interested so I don't have any hopes for it at all, and honestly I've been too depressed to even work on it properly again...
I keep looking at seek or gumtree to maybe find a job that would spark my interest, but nothing seems to make hopeful that it might be worth it all. I just am starting to loose it and not find anything worth it anymore, not even playing video games ...I just sleep or stay up while my boyfriend is at home so he doesn't think anything is wrong.
I just want to know how can I get passion for life and being more positive about any job again? Everything I do I seem to just be crap at: i get the feeling compared to other people I learn extremely slow and even if I try really hard, I always mess up or things still turn out for the worst.

Hello,
 
First time posting here, so sorry if I'm awkward.
I have to leave my current job (about 40k) because of an undiagnosed depression I've been taking too many sick days because I'm unable to go to work because when it comes time to leave in the morning I throw up or I start having a panic attack. I had a meeting with my employer and he said my options are to resign and go seek help or take more time off and face dismissal upon my return. He suggests resign because it'll be easier to come back into the company that way that if I was dismissed. 
I guess I'm posting because I don't know what to do next, that will take away my income and while I live with my partner, who is so amazing and supportive. But, its a lot of pressure to cut the household pay in 2. I'm sorry for the sap story, I'm not looking for charity, I just don't know what to do next.
Thank you
p.s. I'm currently seeing a mental health professional (my appointment is tonight, thankfully)

Hi
I haven't been diagnosed with depression or any mental disorder, my parents have never considered seeing a therapist or anyone for mental health, so no one knows I haven't been feeling too good mentally. I'm not sure what's wrong, but during the day at school, I'm completely fine and happy, though when I arrive home I never feel happy. It seems like I feel sad when alone, but I can't be surrounded by people for too long or I'll feel sad and out of control. I've felt like this for a while, but I have no one to talk to because it is either awkward or I don't want to feel like a burden. Someone help me please, I've been crying myself to sleep nearly every night. Seeing a therapist or talking to someone about this in real life isn't an option. I don't want people to think I'm trying to seem 'cool' because at my age, many people tend to say they have depression or whatever to seem cool, and I might be over-thinking it, but I really need advice
Thanks

Hi there been off work since August waiting for knee surgery, struggling at home i tend to get angry real easily, also stress from my 7 year old daughter isn't helping. The other night i felt very upset i just wanted to walk away from all the problems in my life. My mind was telling me to do things that I'd never do personally. Then again this morning with the pressure of not working, problems at home and various health issues on top of my daughter not even getting dressed for school has just about brought me to breaking point again and unsure what to do. Even thinking of talking about worries gets me upset.

Hi I know I posted about my job anxiety on here but now I’ve realised what’s been driving the other side of my illness...depression. I realise that my kids have no time for me and have decided not to come for Christmas, despite living one hour away. Christmas was so very special each year, but apparently that’s no longer the case. I just get a sigh and “I’m just not into it this year”. But it’s not just Christmas. It’s every special occasion, or even any excuse to see them. I just can’t stop wondering, what is life without family? Friends have been letting me down lately so family is all I’ve got. I paid for a friend to fly and visit but she didn’t even get on the plane. I kind of wish I could adopt a family who would appreciate being spoilt for Christmas.

My partner works 5-6 days a week, leaves at 4:30am and gets home at 6-7pm depending on traffic. I just had a baby 2 months ago and I have a toddler, I spend most of my days crying in the kitchen. Everyday is getting harder. The other day I was having an anxiety attack and I called my partner to come home and help me because I have no one else around and he said he couldnt come home. I dont know how to make him understand. I keep telling him I need a break but he isn't listening.

I’ve reached a point where I’m starting to believe what my family have been telling me all alone. Maybe I have made myself depressed. For so long I’ve been able to suck up my pain, remain positive and get on with my day, until I started feeling flat and dissatisfied even after making it into law school and landing an amazing job. I’ve been feeling so dissatisfied to a point I always call in sick and have stopped going to uni, everything is so hard now, I don’t have that same strength I did 3 years ago.
However in my family’s eyes I am throwing my life away, which I’d understand why they’d think that. But why can’t they help me get it back then, not beat me down and tell me to stop looking for attention, and that my “depression” is costing me my friendships, without providing ANY support since I’ve started my journey 3 years ago. All they want to see are results, but they are not willing to help me get them, not even willing to hear me vent.
I have reached a point when I now regret even looking into this “depression” I wish I’d just continued masking my pain, at least that way I was still functioning.  I am constantly ashamed of myself for allowing myself to say “I have depression” for thinking that by coming out people will support you. Now I’m constantly cautious of what people think of me, I’ve made things worse for myself.

I've always found it hard to share how I truly feel to anyone, especially a stranger. This year I lost a close family member which has left me, well, depressed.
I feel like I need help but every time I try to talk to someone I just clam up and say something to the effect of ""Actually, I'm fine"". The same thoughts always go through my head...
This is stupid! There is nothing wrong stop embarrassing yourself!
Your just doing this to get pity from other people!
You're just being a big sook, man up!
So my question is, how do I talk to someone when everything in me screams not to?

Hello all,
I have always struggled with putting myself out there and I thought it was just a matter of being an introvert.  But this year after the year starting out with a fresh new romantic entanglement and a whole fresh attitude towards life, work and parenting the last couple of months feel like they have just fallen apart and I found myself sitting in the GP’s office barely able to speak without crying, not once but on two seperate occasions across a September and October.  She was very concerned and asked me several questions that I actually answered totally truthfully for the first time in my life.
It turns out that it seems I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for most of my life.  I have taken some time off work but am about to go back next week and it while I haven’t had any anxiety for missing work (and on very short notice for them) I am starting to get a bit panicked about going back.  Mostly because people are going to ask how my “holiday”was and what I got up to.  I can’t tell them I spent the week crying my heart out and lying prostrate on the couch.
I know there are things that have happened in my life that of course have not helped my current mood, but what I have realised is I have always struggled I just didn’t know that’s what I was doing.  I don’t have any support from family where I live and my friendship group is very small.
How up front are you all about telling people of your condition?
Weirdly I am not ashamed of what I suffer from as it explains so much to me but I am not sure how other people will react if I tell them.

Hi guys. First time poster on here.
So i am 33 female and just feel so fed up with life at the moment.
I have suffered from anxiety for as long as I can remember and bouts of depression from time to time but this time it has hung around for 6 months or so. There isnt any major reasons why either, other than the fact my life isn't what I planned it to look like at 33.
I have an awesome supportive family, who I hate putting them through my emotions all the time as I can imagine how draining it can be.
I do have a boyfriend who is a nice guy but I just dont feel the stability i want at my age. We have been together 2 years. He works away alot, has had a gambling problem and his priorities are just not good. Im just not in the right frame of mind to make the decision of what to do in this area.
Things felt so bad yesterday that I decided to go to the hospital. I have just started to see a psychologist recently (have in the past) and first time seeing a psychiatrist a few weeks ago which was very disappointing as for the first consult i was in there for all of 10 minutes and sent away with a new medication  i am still trying to find something that can help... just hate the side effects especially insomnia. 😔
Basically what I have beem struggling with most lately is the mornings.. i hate them. I wake up feeling almost like a dread feeling. Any suggestions on how to overcome this?
Also I always feel the need to sleep. On my days off I feel so exhausted with my anxiety that doing things feels too much.
My social anxiety is getting worse. I don't want to see friends.. i worry about driving. Going to the shops can be a mission.
I envy people that have energy and that are happy. I want to be that person. I have good intentions, read up on ways to help, but when it comes to the crunch... anxiety knocks me down.
Sorry for the rant. Needed to get all that off my chest x

Like the title says.Everything seems to be getting just a little too much these days, i am literally so bored i can't wait for my kids to get home from school so i have someone to talk too. 
I was studying to be a counselor at Tafe but my teach took over three months to mark my first assesment so i deferred because i throught i wasn't going to pass and didn't want to get in any further debt. 
I feel it's kind of a waste of time studying anyway i have zero experience am in my 40s and on a disability pension for a few different reasons. I hate being like this though i would rather work but even studying for 3 hours or so a day really took it out of me. 
I feel like i can't really give my kids anything much and they will grow up being poor and going without,not what im wanting for them.
Really don't know what to do just having a very down day which came by way of a very down past few weeks.

You can't laugh and sulk at the same time...though I've tried.

Well yes, that's why I'm here.
Anyway, there's a funny joke about a guy who gets a flat tyre/tire right by a Lunatic Asylum and he loses the four nuts down the drain and can't put the spare on....stop me if you've heard it....and one of the inmates has been watching the whole scene unfold and says to the guy 'Take one of the nuts off each of the three other wheels and put the spare on with three nuts and drive carefully till you get to a garage'.
""That's brilliant!!"" said the driver.
""I know. I may be crazy but I aint stupid""

I have been feeling lost for over a year. 
I know i should be grateful to have a roof over my head, i have an income and enough to eat.
But i just feel hollow. I try and fill the time with tv, books, music, friends any thing to keep my mind busy. But i end up staring into space.
I have tried therapy, exercise, cbt, medication. None of it worked.
I just don't know how to move forward getting up is a challenge even for something i enjoy.
Can anyone help me with coping?

Hi everyone, I just wanted to introduce myself. Im 27 and unfortunately lost a good part of the last 8 years due to my battles with major depression but I’m proud to say now that I am doing well. I’m not sure where to classify things right now, as I am still having regular ECT to maintain my mood, taking medication and seeing therapists. I am however, happy! I have goals, I see a future, I have started looking for work again and started dating again too ☺️. If you had asked me 6 months ago if any of this was possible, I would have said no way! Recovery and wellness is possible!!! It is also soooo worth it!! I sometimes think about the 30+ hospital admissions, the ongoing day programs and commitment to outpatient appointments. I feel a little ashamed that it took so much effort but I have come out of this a MUCH stronger person. I have drive and commitment now to use my experiences to help others recover and work on their own MH issues. I hope to study next year to enable me to pursue this goal and work in the field. To conclude, I say PLEASE, never give up. Ask for help !! The process can be exhausting and can feel like there is no way forward but there is! And when you are feeling better, even if it’s only a little bit, you will be proud you persisted in fighting. The battle is worth it and recovery and a life beyond whatever ailment you have is amazing! I have so much more gratitude for the small things now, ie a nice sunny day, the fresh air on a morning walk, a good laugh with a friend or a tasty cafe treat. Thank you for reading. Positive vibes ❤️🌈😀

My only bout of moderate clinical depression was caused ultimately by a collision between my upbringing as a child and my wife's expectations and personality as an adult. In retrospect, this was an event that had been building slowly for decades. It was the clinical anxiety that accompanied my depression that drove me to seeing a doctor, this in the face of my wife's opposition. (My wife's opposition was driven by her own fears, but that is another story.) The doctor confirmed my guess that I was suffering from clinical depression. He offered me a choice: medication or counseling. I have an aversion to medication except where absolutely necessary, so I opted for counseling. This choice ultimately led to my development as a person. The doctor referred me for a course of 10 counseling sessions.

The counselor was skilled. I also started the counseling knowing in advance that I would be the author of my own recovery under the counselor's guidance. I opted to have weekly sessions rather than fortnightly sessions. By the end of the fourth session I had an idea of my escape route from depression. I spent the fifth session consolidating that idea, and confirmed to myself my recovery in the week that followed. I spent the sixth session debriefing the counselor, which debriefing the counselor found useful.

The key to my recovery was anger. Anger often receives a bad press these days and is easily confused with rage. My own anger takes the form ""This is not right!"" and always overrides any slide towards depression that starts within me. It can also motivate me to discuss the events leading up to that moment with my wife, which discussions always prove beneficial to both parties. My anger reaction kicks in without me having to make any effort. This situation has been stable for five years.

I realise that this solution is not for everyone. My own Beck Depression Inventory score is 2 (very low). I have started working with somebody whose score hits the mid 20s between treatments. She has a genetic predisposition to depression which was triggered by escalating parental abuse in her teenage years and became chronic at age 20, so my own solution is extremely unlikely to work for her.

The take away from all this? Everybody's journey is different.

Go well.
AAY

Hello BB Citizens,
its been 5 years now since i have been diagnosed with bipolar type 2. Since then, i've gone through sooo many different medications and each day is a roller coaster ride for me. For those that don't know i'm bp, they just see me as an emotional guy that goes up and down. I get judged that i'm temperamental and unstable. My mornings are ridiculous difficult. To be precise, i wake up tired, not motivated, afraid of the day, afraid of peoples judgement, uncomfortable in my own skin, nausious, light headed, electric shock to the face feeling. This is easily presented in my facial and body expression. So when i'm at work between 8-10 people say ""mate, u look dead, get more sleep"". after 10 i'm back to stable normal or if there's something exciting happening, i go along with it. Then around 2pm i'm back to the same dead feeling. 
 
I was absent at work for 3 weeks having ECT treatment and working from home. alot of questions were flung around the office as to what happen to me but my manager didn't tell them. Due to ECT not working, i'm now about to do rTMS which will consume around 1 month off work. i'm planning now to email all people i interact with at work about my bp and the journey i've been on however i don't know how to deliver this information to them. i don't want to be emailing everyone making it like a sob story or a sympathy stab.....
Can i get some suggestions please

Hi all,
A bit about me.
I am a 51 year old women and have suffered major depression for most of my life. From early on in my life I felt ""different"" to every one else around me. I had a very very bad temper and wasnt pleasant to be around. At 31, I was finally dignosed with major depression and was prescribed anti depressants and have been taking these now for over 20 years.
In the past few years my depression has worsened. This is because of my job in the public service, who know by the way of my illness, I have been bullied and harrassed and treated dispectfully by others that I work with. I have never been given or shown any empathy or respect because I have a mental illness.
Recently I decided, for my own mental health and well being, to resign and find a job I really like with nicer people surrounding me. 
The ironic thing is I work at the department of health.

ok so when i was little i was ur typical 'smart, shy kid.' everyone knew me based on my results on tests and exams. that was probably the only reason they were so nice to me, cause i was so shy i couldnt even speak. then a few years later, i met this guy. he opened my eyes to the world, and made me realise that i should come out of my shell. so i did. he made me laugh so hard i cried, and around him i felt safe and happy. the world seemed so much brighter when he was in it. i became one of the 'popular crew' and everything in life felt like it was picking up. that year was grad year, so the next year, everyone was going off on their separate paths in life. i was separated from all my friends. it was weird, cause one minute i could be happy, and laugh like i used to, but the next? i remembered those times where i was truly happy, and everything else seemed like a waste. i think its cause my friends became my family, in a way. not by blood, but by love. i loved every one of them, and i was torn away from them. they were kind of the only family i've ever known, because my blood family puts up all of these expectations that i cant reach anymore. the pressure is getting to me now. it was probably the same before, but back then i had my friends to cheer me up when things got tough. now i have no one. i think im depressed, but i havent told anyone yet. i've left clues for people. i even told someone i was sad all the time, but they didnt pick up on it. what hurts the most is that no one even notices that something is wrong. they just go on, thinking their lives are tough, and im here, sad and depressed.

Hi everyone,

I'm just feeling really stuck at the moment. Between my depression and anxiety, I feel like I can't catch a break. My main issue that I seem to be struggling with is motivation. I end up late at work as I find it hard to leave the house some days, and I just don't enjoy it anymore. I'm in a retail sales role and some days my anxiety can really affect my work. I also stress that I'm not 'fitting in' at my job, which just makes me feel alone. I have horses and to me, riding and spending time with them really clears the mind. But even now I'm finding the motivation to go see them is becoming harder and harder, (It's a 20-minute drive to the agistment). I make up excuses as why I can't go places, it's the same as the gym and anything else I enjoyed. The annoying part is when I have days like this where I don't do anything, I feel even more depressed as I'm disappointed in myself for not doing anything. If that makes sense. It's a vicious cycle. I was on medication, but I found after a few months on it, I would feel numb and just didn't care about anything. I would be willing to give it a go again if it would help with my energy. Just wondering if there's anything that helped others find their motivation.

ok, so I'm in denial still about  having depression. 
The doctor has put me on antidepressants and told me it's all about an imbalance of brain chemicals.
I'm still believing it's about actions in life. (cause/effect)
Curious to know others thoughts on this. 
Is it our actions in life or things that happen to us that cause depression or purely a brain imbalance.

I'm 24 and I was diagnosed with major depression 7 years ago and I've tried all different kinds of medication and seen all different therapists and counselors and psychologists and..... etc.
Nothing has worked, in all these 7 years nothing has worked and I'm sick of my life being wasted. I want a career and a relationship. I want to stop hating myself. I want friends. I want to stop making up events to cover up my empty life.
The last medication I tried put me in hospital so right now I'm not on anything and not sure if I'm willing to be on anything anymore. I'm tired of the side effects like weight gain and drowsiness. I'm tired of the way I feel the negative side effects within hours but positive side effects take months or never. I don't want my life to go like this but nothing will help me out of it and I mentioned TMS to my dad and he said I'm only scratching the surface with medication because ""there's hundreds out there"" and I think he expects me to be able to go through another 7 years of this. Maybe there is hundreds out there but I don't have that much patience.
I don't have friends or support either. Because depression stops me from going places and doing things and feeling things. Therapists always laugh it off and tell me it would work if I tried it and they don't seem to understand how depression is draining me. If I had the energy to do exercise and diet and all that I would but I don't even have the will. If depression hasn't drained me enough, +10 years of abuse from my mum and bullying all through primary and high school have done enough on their own.
I don't think people around me believe me but I've been trying. I got a job, I went to uni, I got a cat for company, I attempted moving out of home, I forced myself to exercise, I try to keep up my hobbies. I try to do all the things that apparently will cure me but I can't manage it. Whenever I try to tell people what I'm feeling, they think I'm just being negative and whiney rather than just actually expressing myself. I can't tell anyone this or that without being told ""yes, exercise helps with that :)""
People just dont understand how deep I'm buried in this. People don't understand how much effort everything takes even if I'm achieving nothing. People think that because I'm young, I'm fine. People don't believe I can be this messed up at this age. People don't listen to me. They won't listen to me.
I don't even know what I'm asking for in this post. Just some understanding I guess.

Hi all,
i have diagnosed depression, plus this year diagnosed as being on the spectrum (which explains a lot about how I am).
i need some advice because I can go from feeling ok to hating myself in the space of a few seconds.
it can happen because I regret what I say or my partner and I have a disagreement and then I feel like it's all my fault even though she says it isn't. And then I feel emptiness and then hate myself for feeling emptiness.
any advice? Thanks.

Hi, I am new to beyondblue and new to the online world of forums. After much consideration, I finally built up enough courage to write my first post.
I am a 43 year old male who has suffered from MDD (Major Depression Disorder), GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder), SAD (Social Anxiety Disorder), and BED (Binge Eating Disorder). I have suffered these disorders for over 24 years of my life. I also suffer from severe sleep apnoea, chronic back pain, and low self esteem.
I wanted to share some of my story for two reasons. Firstly, to see if there are any other members who have experienced similar disorders over a similar period of time. Secondly, I would like to find out some more information regarding an episode I experienced earlier today.
For the last four years, I have been taking medication for my MDD, GAD and SAD. Prior to this, I was taking a different type for approximately 13 years, and before this a mixture of most of the other anti depressants on the market (along with the servere side effects). I found a paticular AD to insight suicide ideation, and feelings to the point of having three relapses whilst taking it. I have been very happy with my current AD in comparison to the other anti depressants. I had been ticking along nicely, until earlier today.
For the first time in over 24 years, I forgot to take my medication. I usually take it like clockwork every morning after breakfast. For whatever reason, I forgot, and most of the day I was feeling very strange. When I realised I had forgotten, I took my medication immediately. However, by this time, most of the day had past. This led to my head hurting like never before, dizziness, neasea, brain clicks, vomiting, hot flushes, shaking, suicidal thoughts and feelings, excruciating pain in my head, and finally a complete emotional break down. It was something I NEVER want to EVER experience again!
I am alright now as the medication has finally kicked in, but for a moment there I was unsure. It really threw me sideways, and I was wanting to know if anybody else on here has had a similar experience? If so, could you please share it with me (and others), as I think it can be helpful for anybody who may go through a similar experience. If you have, I am wondering how long it took you to feel semi normal again?
Thank you for taking the time to read my first ever post! I hope to hear from some of you soon. Bye for now 🙃

I’m constantly struggling with the fact of wether or not I’m worthy for help. I struggling in silence I don’t know if it’s a combination of being too stubborn and feeling like depression and anxiety is beating me because I feel I can’t handle this alone. or not feeling like my mental health is valid because I am lucky to have the life I have. It’s amazing how dark your head can get and how well you can disguise how aweful you feel. I hate my head, it’s a mean place I obsess  I get stuck in loops of self doubt that I can’t escape. I get frustrated with myself as I feel I can’t properly function as a normal human being, but things appear normal on the surface. I’ve feel I’ve lost all passion for things that I enjoyed. I don’t even know what I enjoy anymore. I don’t have an outlet to escape or relax. I’m holding onto to toxic thoughts and crippling sadness but some how I manage to function I go to work, I just cry in the car on the way and suck it up and get another day over with. My life feels like I’m constantly sleep walking, I feel like a zombie. The thing is I am such a lucky person in the sense that I have a beautiful family and a loving partner  so many other people have it so much worse. I don’t know why I get like this I can’t definitely say this one thing is why I feel this way. Which makes it all the more confusing when I don’t know what tiggers it. The only way I can understand it is a combination of stress and past experiences that have bottled up and manifested into this toxic cloud. I’ll be functioning and then it hits me hard. I feel I can’t handle stress at all and makes me feel pathetic.  I’m just so tired of feeling so fragile. I’ve tried to get help before but I can never see anyone because it clashes with work. It takes so so much courage for me to even get to that doctors appointment. I feel this forum might help I need some where to talk because I do need some help and I’m feeling so lost.

Hi there,
this is my first post here about anything so as you probably can all imagine I'm freaking out. 
I've always had depression for as long as I can remember, even before I was diagnosed or even knew what it was. I'm 23 and been on antidepressants for about 6 months, first time being medicated. 
I took a long time to know what I wanted to do after school, did uni for 2 years and failed a bunch of stuff because of depression and a lack of interest or drive in what I was doing, ended up moving home to get a shitty kitchenhand job that I ended up falling in love with and after 3 years knowing I wanted to do a chefs apprenticeship. At that job I had an extremely close group of friends but felt I had to leave due to a few reasons and even to an extent excited to leave and start afresh somewhere new. But that's been hard as hospitality hours make it difficult to socialise outside of work and I definitely rely on my friends probably too much to help keep me well. 
But long story short I ended up getting an apprenticeship at one of the best restaurants in my town, and have been there for just over 2 weeks, I was really excited and anxious as shit but pretty keen for it all because I know I'm capable and ready to start my career. 
I ended up being really sick on the last Friday, but i went to work for the lunch shift, but didn't go back that night because everyone said I was too sick, I also couldn't go for the Saturday. We close on Sundays and then on Monday, not being sick anymore, but I slept through my alarms and just couldn't go. I was too anxious to ring up and say what had happened plus not knowing how to articulate it to my boss. Tuesdays I normally have off which brings me to today Wednesday, I'm so freaking depressed and anxious about it, I've been lying in bed for 3 hours now trying to get up and I can't, I want nothing more than to get up and go in and confidently say sorry about Monday but I'm super depressed, should have called up, it won't happen again but I physically cannot make myself move from this bed. I know the longer I leave it the worse off I'll be for it at work, if I even still have a job there. I don't know if this is self sabotaging, or my depression is getting worse or what it is, to a point I've always been able to go to work no matter how hard it was but now I can't seem too. 
I don't know what to do or if writing this will even result in any help but I'm at a total loss and feel paralysed.

It is a year since I had my first meltdown, followed by another approx 3 months later. I have tried to pretend that I am ok. I have tried to take medication, and see a psychologist. I am pretending everything is ok, but some times I am only just getting through the day. I don't know who I can trust. I feel like everything I see or hear is targeted specifically at me. I guess you would describe it as being paranoid. But I honestly believe that some strange events generating an overwhelming fear of threats has caused this. I don't know what to classify my problem as. The doctors told me it is a psychosis. My problem is, though, that if something actually happened to generate fear to the extent that a paranoia results, then is it psychosis? Is it fear? is it anxiety? I am struggling to know who I should be speaking to, particularly when everyone I tell even a part of the events to, seems to think that it is not possible.
Any advice appreciated to clarify where I sit in the spectrum and plethora of possible diagnoses.

My story
I developed depression what I had a very negative expereince in my second job out of uni. I was young so i just put up with the negative working environment and the stress.
After 3 years i am almost completely recovered. I had a week in the maldives that i think i was the happiest i have ever been and no depression symptoms. It does come up now and then for me but is temporary and very mild, i more just feel really tired some days. 
Looking back i think it was related to stress chemicals, i was getting horrible anxiety symptoms such as finger tingling and racing thoughts. The negative experience i interpreted as me being 'incapable' of being in a career job. 
What helped me was I got myself another job after 6 months of no job (i dont recommend staying unemployed for long it makes it worse). I was soooooo anxious and scared about another career job but i did it anyway.
The self confidence i experienced by doing this allowed me to not 'worry' as much which i think triggered the depression a lot. It almost reversed the negative belief i had formed about my abilities because if i had held a career job for a few months and felt i could keep on with it how was i useless? It also made me busier and more distracted which cut the cycle of rumination. 
My hypothesis
I do think depression is chemical related but it is also a phenomenan in its own right. Like a panic attack or heart break. It i causes a cycle of thoughts, experiences and feelings. I do think to a degree chemicals are highly related to the depression, thoughts cause negative feelings. However I think perhaps negative beliefs cause thoughts which cause stress chemicals related to depression. I think exercise and eating healthy can help fuel your energy to fight the negative thoughts and add to reversing the cycle. I think going out and about and socialising can cut through the rumination and break the cycle too. 
My hypothesis is that depression isnt solely a chemical reaction or a single thought that causes a negative feeling. It is a cycle of thoughts that can circle down if you dont do something to stop the cycle. And the negative thoughts associated with the cycle cause a negative experience. The thoughts get so strong that it can be hard to differentiate because every thought has that negative spin on it. 
This is my hypothesis anyway!
Would love to hear your hypothesis

Hi All!
I have posted elsewhere that I suffer clinical depression, social anxiety, GAD, and OCD.  
One of the byproducts of this is that my mind is constantly racing.  I cannot stop thinking about anything and everything.  Phrases stick in my thoughts and I keep repeating them to myself, until another phrase or thought takes over.  Endless roller-coaster and often meaningless.  Can be something I have read, heard or said.  
Not sure what I am really asking in this thread.  Perhaps just venting my frustration.
Take care
K

I was born with a genetic disorder known as FRAXE, though mild it effects me daily and makes recovering from depression almost impossible. I do not look mentally ill so I tend to be treated like anyone else but this often makes it hard in situations that I can’t handle. I’m 192cm and I have a solid build so when I hear loud noises and have a breakdown most people assume it’s drugs or I’m just being an idiot. People think because I don’t look fragile that I must be able to handle anything and yet loud train stations freak me out. My dad is very ill (had cancer and now a infection in his spine + lung cancer) as a 18 year old I feel like I am going through all the worst crap at once. I can’t imagine my future and can’t see how I could even go another 5 years let alone another 18. Last thing, as someone who struggles to express themselves and is socially awkward when I do and an adult says “you’re only 18 you haven’t had any real problems yet” my rage kicks in and I feel like dropping them.

I have BPD, Depression and a bunch of other stuff though they are the main ones. My mother just told me I'm being horrible, I need to quit my negative downer bullshit and get along with my step family who understand me as to the depth of a frozen fish finger. Isolation is my problem, we could (my family) be In the same urban lounge room yet feel like Perth to Melbourne away. This makes me furious in 2017 how can these ignorant people I am beginning to loath be called my family and attempt a relationship with me and my mental health as if it's 1950. As if enough tounge lashings will get the ""crazy"" out of me. ""Have you Tried not taking protein powder?, not having caffeine after lunch?, not thinking about negative things?"" Yep this line of thinking exists. Luckily I am blessed with a brain capable of freeing me from this hell. I will complete my medical study and devote my life to freeing other. A proverbial middle finger to mine and all the family's who treat there mentality I'll kin like this and hold on I'm working to help. Thanks for the work moderators and beyond blue for this service. 😊

Been such a rough 5 -6yrs .  Been fakin it till l make it so long now l can hardly tell what l feel anymore apart from 18mths with a new love after divorce , a lot of that was all new and beautiful highs and l was alive again but now that's broken up also.
New house finally 10mths ago , after struggling my ass off for 5yrs after divorce but l just do not fit in or like the town, l do love the house though.
l work at home on my own , some customer contact and traveling long trips too, alone though.
But now with my gf break up on top and this town being small and nothing going on , it's just too easy to either hang out around the house alone or work on the place , if l'm not working or come to bed and go on the net.
l'm getting so use to living like this lately l feel as if l could just do it till l drop dead really especially if l stay here but then l will forever have no life if l do.
l do try to make myself do things , been out to the pub a few times with a brother who lives 30mins over, went up to the mountains the other wkend, take my daughter lots of places which she's really the only people time l enjoy tbh. The rest is just a huge effort that just leaves me void anyway.
l still eat and sleep , but only just.
And now l feel like if l don't sell the house and get the hell outa here next year my life will just fizzle away before my eyes. But l have no idea where to go or what to do , l need to stay fairly close to my daughter too but financially options are very limited.
l'm early 50s , so many moves in my life , ex w and l moved and traveled all over for years, haven't stayed anywhere since l left home at 17 really, longest 7yrs, and l no longer trust my own judgement especially after being silly enough to move here.
life just feels like nothing and l just feel like all l'm really interested in doing is jumping out of bed to see my daughter and that's about it.
It really worries me that l could really easily just exist like this and to hell with the world or life. 
l'm so use to pushing myself through mentally though with this last 5-6yrs and faking it, l feel numb. l loved my gf so much and we'd talked about marriage, yet half the time l'm smiling , think l'm too scared not to fake it because if l don't l'd just fall in a heap. No family and l don't really have any good friends , that all went with my divorce , know about anything l feel or have been going through and now l even hide the break up with gf. 
Just don't know anymore.

This is my first time ever opening up so this post probably isn't going to make much sense. 
Ive been struggling with depression and anxiety for a couple years now. Im sick of thinking, its all i do. All i think about is how other perceive me and if they're talking about me behind my back. I cant let anyone in close because i just feel so vulnerable. I honestly have no clue who i am and this just makes my anxiety even worse. Everywhere i go i feel like a complete weirdo. Since my anxietys so bad i avoid engaging in conversation and when i do try im normally at a lost for words and there is just an awkward silence. I swear sometimes im not even apart of my own life im just sitting back and watching life happen around me. I barely feel any emotions anymore. I feel im just a character in a computer program just there to make up numbers. I honestly dont know what to do anymore i started following a spiritual path based on budhism but im starting to think im not going down any path ive just lost myself. I feel like im going crazy and losing touch with reality. I think my biggest issue is that i have no self confidence and always look to others for approval even though i know i shouldnt. I think if i had some self confidence i could more confident when talking to people and id stop caring what people think. But its so hard to find any sort of confidence when i dont even know who i am. I miss social contact i want to have best friends and go out with them and have a good time instead of being that boring guy my ""friends"" let me hang around coz they feel sorry for me.
I dont know where this post is going and i dont even know how to explain half the stuff in my head so i guess ill leave it here.

I feel bad for posting again. I have posted a couple of times and I have been okay. So now I feel like to post would be attention seeking and selfish as my mood is inconsistent it feels like i am faking it. 
i stay up late in order to force dark thoughts. I know it’s unhelpful but I do it anyway. 
I am struggling with coming to terms with my Identity. Recently I’ve been talking with my psychologist about my biological father who I don’t remember. I just don’t know who I am. I lost myself a few years ago when I sunk into depression. 
I feel worthless. I feel a lot of hate towards myself. I don’t deserve the life I’ve been given and the people in my life. I kind of want to disappear. I keep thinking about driving away. But I know it would hurt the people around me. It would worry them. But in a sick way I want them to worry. I feel awful for thinking that.
I guess I am lost, lonely and unsure. 
Perhaps I just want someone to listen. Tomorrow I will wake up and I will be fine. So maybe it’s all in my head. Maybe i am just making it all up.

I feel like my life is in a never ending rollercoaster ride of things going well and things going straight to hell... All feelings are to the extreme. Small disappointment that would not impact me before, now becomes this huge thing that impacts everything in a negative way.
One week things are good - i am actively planning new things, enjoying life and enjoying time with my partner and friends. Then something happens (usually something small) and I go from happy go lucky to miserable person who does not want to see anyone or plan anything. I feel like this up and down roller coaster just never stops. My mood swings are extreme and my nearest also see them - and struggle to cope with it.
Did you have similar roller coaster feeling before you were diagnosed and treated? I know everyone is different but would like to hear your experiences.

Hey there, I have a problem where I cry over small things I know aren't normal to cry about. For example, today my parents told me they would make time to teach me how to drive. They said that at around 1PM we would go out and have a little drive around. I expected them to cancel on me and they did which resulted in me crying and over thinking about all the times they've disappointed me when it comes to spending quality time with me.
It's not just that though, there are other even stupider reasons I cry and when I DO cry it's literally heart wrenching sobs that I try to conceal when I'm in my room so no one hears me. I also have absolutely no motivation to do anything, I wont do anything unless someone is there with me because otherwise I just wont feel like doing it. I get very upset each time someone makes a mean comment (especially when I'm close with the person that makes said comments) and again sneak off to my room to *suprise* cry about it. 
I never talk about this to anyone because I know they won't take it seriously. I don't know what's wrong with me and I feel so confused and lost. This has been happening for at least 2 years but I haven't thought much about it until recently because it has become a daily thing now. I just want to feel like myself again.
Thank you so much for any help, I appreciate it a lot.

So. Background. I have had depression from aged 13, most seriously in late teens, early 20s. I learned to manage it very effectively with a great selfcare routine and some cognitive behavioural therapy. I had a baby at the end of 2016 and he has been a very easy baby. I actually coped quite well until the last month or so. I get angry/frustrated very easily, insomnia is making it worse, I cry at the slightest hint of everything. I feel awful I get impatient with my son when he won't nap or shrieks his god awful ear splitting squeal, I don't do anything, just internally scream and tense up. 
I can feel that my depression is taking over again and that frustrates me too as I know that I have had it under control before. Then I feel bad for whining because sooo many people have it worse and I have everything a person could want.

I am reaching out with the hope that someone else may be in the same prediciment I married a guy, who I met at Uni we had things in common at the time. We had a pretty good first 5 years of marriage, until his father died, their family business was in a dire stituation, they eventually had to claim bankruptcy.We had a baby in the mix of all of this, so I was tired, our daughter had reflux and food allergies, so I was sleep deprived and not in a great place, I felt isolated and lonely. My GP diagnosed me with anxiety and depression. At the time, I was so upset, I was actually offended when she first suggested that I had a problem. So I decided to start taking the prescribed medication, I put weight, close to 10kg, drank excessively at functions, made a dick of myself in a quite few instances. I finally pleaded with my GP that I was stacking on weight and not well, and she reluctantly changed me to another medication. I felt slightly better on this, sleep was welcome, but I felt nothing, I hated that feeling, so I just decided to stop taking medication, eat properly and stop drinking. My husband is away this weekend and he left his iPad on the bench, click the home screen to google Peppa Pig and ""My wife is not remotely interested in me."" Subtle! At first I was angry, I thought far out cut me some slack. Then I thought he is probably right, I feel we are drifting apart, I no longer trust him. I no longer even feel like being intimate, which is where his frustration lies. He excessively gambles owes thousands on credit cards, he is secretive and took a margin loan on our home loan to buy risky startup company shares, which are not performing. Our account called me when he compiled our tax returns, to inform me that he thinks he has a gambling problem.I was shocked when he showed me the transactions on his credit cards. I feel like he is heading down the same track as his father and it scares me. Sometimes I think I should just leave, our daughter is the only thing that really stops me, she loves him dearly. I am stuck feeling nothing for the person I share a life with, I don't think I love him anymore, and I feel we would be quite possibly be happier apart. I tried to leave him once, he put on such a performance, called my parents and made out my depression is the problem and every time we have an argument it's always my fault.I know I probably sound like poor me, but not really sure where I should start. Any adivce from the community would be greatly appreciated.

I was starting to believe that my constant companion, my pervasive melancholy, had given up and left my body/psych. I had 11 days where I felt normal, not manic, not depressed, just normal or what I call it at least. Nothing was an effort, I was functioning at a level I had forgotten about. It was wonderful and it was noticed by family and friends and I felt on top of life for the first time in years. But my 11 days of mental peace has evaporated and has plunged me back to what has become my tortured life. Nothing happened in my life that gave me 11 days of respite and nothing happened that took that away and therefore I am even more convinced that depression has brain chemical impacts of some description. For a while I had hope that this mental affliction had run its course, but no. I think it would have been better not to have experienced the brief lifting of the swirling black fog that many of us live with. I've not had much success with medication in the past, perhaps its time to try again although it is difficult living in the bush. Cheers and thanks for listening.

My birthday. I thought that M would have cooked me breakfast or at least made me a coffee in bed but no. I feel unimportant. Then I feel horrible because he is going through so much stress at work.
Mel tells me that she must be the worst sister in-law because she never remembers my birthday. I don’t know WHY she felt like she had to tell me this. No hug from B & M.
I thought J may have had the kids ring me on my birthday to wish me HB but I just got a quick text. I think that if I had small children I would have them call because I know it would make the other person feel great. I guess people don’t think like me.
I need to not have expectations of people. Everyone has their own shit.
I look at the photos on Instagram and everyone is so thin and beautiful and gorgeous with amazing clothes. I look at myself. Yet I can’t stop looking. Why do I torture myself? I know it’s not REAL.
I now weigh 107kg. I feel so so gross. But I also feel so sad and so tired. I just want to sleep. Then I feel like I’m useless. Just get up & get out and DO something then. But I feel so anxious and so sad. And so tired.
I don’t want to work . I want to work on myself. I want to feel good. I want to feel happy. I want to feel important. Like I matter. I’m afraid. Of failing again.
I don’t WANT to get the job I applied for. I really don’t want to do it. Then I feel horrible and guilty.
I want to go to L’s BD dinner but I feel so disgusting and fat I’m embarrassed. I ache. My stomach hurts. My hips hurt SO much all the time. My leg hurts SO much ALL THE TIME.
I want to sew but then I feel horrible in the clothes because of my size. I think what’s the point.
I need help.
Who can help me though?
I don’t want to talk to my friends. People have their own shit.
I fail. I don’t see things through. Then I fail. I start but never finish.
How do I pull myself up? How do I stop relying on the actions of others to make myself feel good?
I need help.

I have felt for a long time the anxiety towards failing goals and letting friends/family down.  Being diagnosed borderline was a lightbulb moment in ""normalising"" my sense of self as I thought it was the embarressment and shame I carried around from childhood trauma. 
I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia one year ago, lost my job because I could not carry out the duties anymore. I found myself down the path of study to find a job that would not need manual handling. 
The trouble I have is that I cannot overcome my fear of failing, it is that bad I am so indecisive that I cannot get any work done on my essays. I am afraid and ashamed although a step by step process has been laid out. 
any insight anyone would have on this would be wonderful as I not sure how therapy could help?

Hi,

I moved to Australia from Canada with my husband (who is Australian). 
One year later, I find I am sad, depressed, lost most of the time, and lack interest and motivation for pretty much everything. As of late, the
tears kick in and I have no idea why. Sometimes I’ll think about why I am crying, concluding it just comes from deep within. It’s wearing on me.

I read then get bored. Finding work is nearly impossible without motivation or interest. Working out is limited to walks and wandering outside.
If I work out intensely I find it makes me anxious. Being new here, it’s difficult to make friends thus the feeling of loneliness is extreme. My husband doesn’t understand and it gets frustrating. 

Activities and hobbies don’t help. I wander the cafes, the galleries, the streets, the tourist attractions and sights, and anywhere where
people congregate. All this activity does not help. If anything, it makes me feel worse. I am on auto pilot trying to fit in but really, I have no interest.
Even as I write this, expressing it has made me cry.

Hiya, I'm Harmony. I'm almost going to be 16 soon. 
I have been quite depressed for 3 years now due to really bad bullying from those 3 years. My parents do know about the bullying, but I only came out about the depression around a month ago, as it was getting too much and it's really starting to affect my schooling. 
To be very honest, I often say to myself 'I don't feel like living today'. I find it quite hard to get out of bed, as I see no point in going to school or making friends, but I have to because life needs me to. Life just seems really, really hard. I have isolated myself from my family, as 85% of the time I'm in my room. I don't have the highest opinion of myself, and my self-esteem is quite low. I often eat a lot (especially sweets) and I feel like a burden to my family because I'm now not performing well as I used to at school. I feel like a failure. I have many coping/escapism methods. The big two are video games and the internet. I know they aren't going to be good in the long run, but it keeps my mind off thinking about myself. Or should I say, it gives me a break from my head.
Another one is making others happy, as I don't see the reason to be sad if everyone else is happy, and seeing others be happy should make you happy. I guess being a happy, cheery individual who tries to make others happy. But it's just an act I put up for many friends and family. I feel awful and small.
I have talked to counselors at school, who did talk to my parents. However, it seems that this stuff is not really in my parent's priorities right now. My parents say they're going to take me to a doctor, but that was almost 3 weeks ago. And as I see it, it just seems they're pushing it to the side because they claim 'well, you look fine when you're on the internet' and stuff. When I can't even get out of bed because of this, they accuse me of taking advantage of my feelings to not do anything or help out or even being manipulative. They accuse me of laziness when I don't have the best grades or bringing assessments because I'm literarily scared of the people at school to even go. They complain that I don't open up to them, but that's because they're pressuring me to talk instead of waiting until I'm comfortable. 
All I ask is to give me advice.I don't really have any friends or close family members right now. It would help me.
 
Thanks for reading my story

I worked here in Sydney till July 2005 then I had to leave Australia in a hurry to be near my old sick mother in Algeria. In 2010 I got married and had 4 children, two boys (6 and 5 years old) and two girls (3.5 and 2.5 years old). My children got their citizenship by descent.
When my mother died in 2015, I came back to Australia. Since then I have been looking very hard for work but until now nothing, only some part-time short contract jobs (few hours by weeks, 2 hours/week). I am now 55 years old and I am disabled, I do have polio at my right leg. I do need   sticks to walk. I am now more than 30 months without my wife and children (one born in 2015 when I was here). I am very depressed. I do miss my wife and kids, and see no solution to all my tentative to bring them here because of all the hurdles I am facing each time I try to do something about it. The application spouse visa fee is AU$7000, the ticket costs for 5 persons will be more than AU$6000. I do not have that amount without stable job or not! I do not see myself having that amount in the near future! I am very very depressed, I hate this life at this stage.
I just need some advices or help on how to resolve this mess.
Please appreciate all kind of help and advises.

I think I have depression and I am too scared to talk about it- I don't know why. I never judge anyone in my life with mental illness so why am I judging myself. 
i am exhausted all the time. I am constantly tired and my job is customer facing so I always have to be happy and chirpy and I think this is making me more depressed. I use so much energy hiding the true way I feel, I feel like a fraud. 
 
I think im scared because I am 'the life of the party' and I don't want people to think less of me. I'm scared to tell my boss even though I know it's effecting my job. I think he will judge me and not give me a promotion if he knows I'm not mentally strong. 
 
I always push push though it but I amsturggling with the tiredness and lack of motivation. I have no self worth.
 
everything seems like a struggle. Every day. The smallest tasks. 
 
I just wanted to take this this first step in posting while I build up the courage to get help. 
thanks for listening

Hi Everyone
I eat well, I exercise, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I have early nights, I wakeup early and I feel like this depression is just a road uphill without relief. I have to spend so much time and energy on self care, management, treatment and surviving that I don't have any energy to spend on other ways to use my time and have any sort of life purpose.
I have chosen to be no-contact with my family (except my mother for financial reasons) and removed myself from all the toxic friendships I had accumulated over the years.
 I live with ADHD, depression and anxiety and am on ADHD medication (which does help the anxiety and mood a bit, too. I also have a Psychiatrist I see every two weeks or so for psychotherapy.
I feel like I am always either barely holding on, or losing my strength. It is exhausting.
I am 33 years old, was married at 20, divorced at 28, moved almost once every two years on average, had more relationships than I can count on two hands, worked in 21 jobs, changed career three times.... Now, I have been single for a year (which is a first since I was 17), unemployed for almost two years now (for medical reasons) and I have lost all hope of any future for myself.
The show must go on, I know, but I feel so lost and alone and rarely have sustained energy to help myself further.
 Does anyone else struggle in this way?

Before any of this I was really battling with my depression and anxiety and am gonna be starting up therapy soon but on the 9/10/17 I got the worst news of my life from my Dad that my Pop had been in a accident in Thailand the day before and was hit by a car riding his bicycle..... he fought for 11 whole days and for those whole 11 days there was so so so so many tears shedded but then when I found out he couldn’t hold on any longer and passed away I was in shock, I couldn’t cry. I was actually out watching my friend sing when I had found out and she was just finishing up, I had ran off to the bathrooms just shaking so much she said she had never seen someone shake so much before but even then I couldn’t cry because I kept getting all these drunk people coming up to me at the same time to check if I was okay. I was glad I want alone and had my friend with me that day to comfort me.
But the thing is I want to cry, I can feel every little bit of emotion going through me like I normally would when someone passes away but I just can’t find the tears anymore :( 
And now too busy worrying about my Aunty that is stuck over there still and can’t leave till all his medical bills are payed and if they aren’t payed they won’t let us get him cremated :( 
I have so many different emotions going through me right now. Is it normal to not cry when someone passes away? I want to cry tho I need to cry that’s the thing

I lack drive and motivation. I don't know how to TRY anymore. Heating up leftovers feels like too much effort. Washing the dishes even once a week when I run out of clean ones feels like too much effort. Dragging myself through the work week ahead feels like far too much effort. I want a break from everything.
Does it actually get better or do we just distract ourselves from the constant drag?
I don't want to deal with starting the expensive (no one actually charges the medicare rate... more like $80+ on top of it) GP->test->psych appointment train again only to wind up with ""keep on keeping on"" and 'strategies' that anyone with an internet connection could find.

So I'm 18 and Ive just started uni this year and for the past 3 months Ive been feeling down all the time, I recently lost a friend during the first part of this year who was a neighbor who was in his 80s who I would help with chores and he would teach me about radio's (because he was a ham radio operator). I didn't realized how much it would effect me because I think this has piled on with the stress of uni. Recently Ive just been feeling get these waves of feeling really depressed and think about how I dont have anyone to really talk to and that no one really understands me. Normally it happens on the weekend and I would be able to push it aside by he week when I need to interact with my friends, but recently it crept over to the week and I think they are noticing because they told me I looked a bit off. I dont want to talk to my parents or friends about this because I feel they would treat me like I'm crazy.
I just need someone to talk to to help me figure this out.

I'm nearly 20 and havent had a job since I was 17 due to my mental health. 
I have depression plus social anxiety and agoraphobia and haven't been able to go for a job as I am always so terrified but when I don't go for jobs I feel depressed because I feel like a failure at life. 
I'm attending part time studying at the university and that is going well but I'm also on Centrelink for my mental health but they don't classify mental health as a long term condition and therefore I have to apply for jobs. 
I hate being put under pressure and feel nauseous whenever I have to deal with Centrelink now as I'm so scared they will tell me I just need to get over it. I already had a meeting with a nurse at the Centrelink who told me that she can cancel my doctors notes that say I can not work for the next 3 months if it continues to happen. 
It's not that I don't want to work/volunteer its just that some days I'm not reliable to come into work as my depression doesn't let me get out of bed but then other days my anxiety doesn't let me even catch a bus in fear of something happening that I cant control or help. 
Please somebody help me make sense of all this because I'm feeling like a failure and pathetic.

Hi there, I have been dating my girlfriend for 4 months now and just recently she has been diagnosed with depression. She has not entirely blocked me out of her life but has said she has no feelings for me or anyone atm. Being young and in love it hurt to hear her say that and I don’t plan on leaving her ever. I try message her and it’s always a negative response like we’re no longer together but as her psychologist says it’s just her brain doing this. I have only ever been with her in person 1 time in the 4 months we’ve been dating which makes it so much more tough. She is on medication and does see a psychologist and now it’s gotten to the stage where she needs more help. I speak to her mum almost every night to ask how she is and she seems fine but when I’m talking through her mum. Her whole family knows we are still together and the depression is doing this to her but now I’m hurting just as much.

Hi all, this is my first time here so I'm sorry of this is in the wrong place.
ive had depression, anxiety and anorexia nervosa for about 10 years now with periods where it was under control and some where it was not.
i just started a new childcare traineeship, I'm about 2 months in but I've already missed a lot of days due to ""episodes"". It's not the job cause if the issues, I love my job but it's getting to the point where I can't even cope with day to day living. I'm constantly in tears and in a panic.
ive had a doctors certificate every time, but I had a meeting with my manager yesterday saying that head office wasn't happy with me and that I can't take anymore days off.
i have a 3 monthly evaluation coming up in which I know there is a chance I'll get sacked.
my boss is also been supportive and trying to communicate with head office what is going on, so if I leave I'll feel absolutely terrible about that.
my question is, do I resign before they sack me and try and get better before I look for another job?
advice will be much appreciated.
thanks

Ok, so my first thread hit a hiccup.
People were asking me questions, and I was trying to answer them, but by answering them I had to discuss things that were ""outside"" of the main thread topic and it was causing problems.
I'm not the kind of person that likes to ignore people engaging with me, and continue on as if they were not there. But I was unable to think of a way around it (which for me is a novel experience... albiet a slightly frustrating one). 
Hence as you can see by the title I have created a thread that is undefined and therefore not bound or restricted in any way for people to discuss anything and everything their little hearts desire and enables me to respond without having to worry about derailing the topic.
* Note that of course standard BB forum rules still apply... no swearing, insulting other contributers etc etc
I added the word ""depression"" as the discussion should still basically revolve around the subject of depression/sadness/negative feelings and experiences etc.
However, thoughts, perspectives, alternative POV's, theories, abstract ideas etc on depression are not only welcome... but EXTREMELY encouraged.
And because I put my name on there, I think that should allow people to ask me whatever personal questions and I should be able to respond. So I'll do my best to answer any question directed at me.
It is a bit of an experiment... let's see how it goes.

This is my first post here. I was diagnosed with BP Type II at the age of 16 ( I’m aged 44 now ). I’ve been taking medication for most of that time ( only going off it a couple of times ). It’s been great for me except that it’s been damaging my kidneys. My PD recently took me off it as my levels had become toxic ( 1.7 ). He’s put me on an alternative nstead. I’ve found that it’s great for sleeping ( now getting 9-10 hrs sleep per night ) but it makes me feel very dissociative and in a dream-like status the next day which I really hate. Was wondering if anyone else experienced similar reactions to medication and if they were able to do anything about it to help? Thanks! 😊

Hi,
I'd like to know other peoples opinion on what I'm going through. Actually, I feel I can't make certain decisions. I guess i'm stubborn in some ways or maybe frightened.
I've come along way mentally. I haven't had a apocalyptic episode for a while (5-6 weeks). I still have low mood and can catch the apocalyptic episode before it happens with acceptance and positive thinking.
Motivation to do things like getting out of the house and just doing things is a huge effort even with positive thinking and knowing the benefits.
My GP has offered anti-depressants over the last 2 years but I always refuse, thinking I can do this without them. I'm not so sure now. I still have not made any new friends, not sure which direction to take about my future. I still feel I'm not all there but i know I never will be if I don't continue to change my life. I wonder if I've just hit a wall, tired of this journey, maybe lazy, maybe just need to slap myself out of it.
I finally let myself see a councilor but its only been 2 consultations so far. 
I guess I want to know if anti-depressants will benefit me or delay progress?

Hi all: I reluctantly came off my medication 3 weeks ago on a psychiatrist's advice. All this time I have been feeling worse and worse and worse, and finally I reluctantly went back on the medication yesterday.
 
On my medication I was doing OK, not great, but was capable of enjoying things. These last 3 weeks I have felt nothing but hideous nausea, misery and disconnectedness from my loved ones. I wake up every morning so tense my bowels turn to water, and I can't eat properly until late afternoon/evening. Every day is crawling past, minute by minute, joyless and miserable. Coming off the medication was the worst mistake I have ever made, and if I had a time machine I would go back and physically force myself not to make any changes.
Can anyone reassure me that going back on the medication is likely to get me back to where I used to be, and quite soon? It didn't seem that brilliant at the time, but from here it seems like paradise.

If you have depression you know how hard it can be at time, you cut your self of from everyone out there, you get in to a very bad head space and a black hole.
Are there people out there that can love us all the time with owe depression. And stand with us when we are in that mind set, as I have heard a lot of people and my self had people walk away because it gets to hard. Now I think I am un-loveable because of what I have.
Do they fall in love with you and only find out about your depression years later as you try and hide it from them at the start as you want someone to let be you?

It was my birthday a few days ago and although I've never made a big deal of it I have been deeply hurt by the fact my friends didn't remember and only one texted. Another friend emailed in reply to someone else and mentioned my birthday. It makes me feel sick as I think so much of them and I'm not even worth a text! They all have partners and babies and this proves they don't think much of me. I don't want to speak to them or see them again. But then I will truly be on my own.

Hello everyone. 
I have this ex which I have a lot of history (mostly complicated) and I need to let her go but I just can never seem to. 
We always fight, we have tried to remain friends with benefits, for weeks we are great, we hang out we talk we have fun and mostly we are happy but then something happens like she cancels on me (and let me just say she does like usually 9 times outta 10) and I get so irritated cause she's knows how much I hate it, then it just gets outta control and it gets bad. Then we don't speak for weeks and then it becomes better and we go through it all over again a month or 2 months later. 
I don't want a relationship with her and neither do I. But I've known her for so long and we have been through a lot that I just want her around but she makes me feel so shit about myself because I just want to see her or hang out. Then I'm in the wrong cause I get emotional when she doesn't want to see me. Am I insane? Am I crazy? 
i know I probably need to let her go, she makes me so mad and upset and I get into these moods that I can't get out of for days. 
I just don't know what to do anymore. I need help

I frequently have feelings of being stuck and feeling like I should be further along in my life. I feel like I should be more successful and more stable.
I was recent diagnosed with Bipolar and found that this feeling is something associated with my Bipolar.
I have a decent, well paying job in a call centre. But I really don't like it. I find it difficult to cope with a lot of the pressure associated with the work and the contract we work under. I feel very pressured as a whole. 
This is another area where I feel stuck. I want to keep the job because of the money, and my partner and I are getting our own place soon hopefully. But I'm not at all happy in my job and I'm struggling and suffering. It also makes it hard to arrange meetings with my psychs because they mostly work on weekdays. I should also mention that I'm dropped a shift a week to try and help myself but right now, I'm not into it at all. 
Does anyone else feel like this, any solutions or tips?
Thank You ❤️

I think I might have made the really tough choice to avoid a couple of family members, one being my mother, as much as possible to help me with recovery. The really tricky bit is I have always craved them in my life, chasing seemingly elusive validation and acceptance. But I think I need to be much stronger and sure of myself before attempting to have much to do with them again or I might get worse. In the past and now, the more time I spend with them the worse I seem to feel. But whether avoiding them is for the better or not is yet to be seen I guess. 
Has anyone else felt the need to distance themselves from particular people to help with their recovery?

I feel completely swamped in my life. I'm living a life that isnt mine anymore I don't have a clue what I'm doing. It makes me want to run away to nowhere and live a simple life. I'm 20, I previously had anorexia for 2 years, I have anxiety and severe depression which I take medication for. 
Every health professional I talk to treat me like I should be better by now, it seems like its problem after problem and no one takes me seriously, I'm supposed to be doing well at uni but I'm not, I have a job but its very irregular, I have a couple of friends but I never want to go out. I have obviously a lot of self esteem issues and boy issues, I don't think anyone will ever love me and I know that its stupid and someone will but it feels like i've been waiting my whole life to not feel invisible. 
I don't know how to help myself, I've seen psychs im on medication, I try to do everything right and my life still feels so awful, I'm in pain daily from my depression and I don't know how much longer I can survive like this. 
I have no clue how to help myself.

I hate being like this, consistently feeling like I am not good enough for anyone around me, always feeling so down and depressed that some how that everything thats going wrong in my life is my fault. Currently doing year 12 so the stress of doing well is destroying me, if i don't get a good score I will be a failure to everyone around me. Everyday I dont want to wake up, every night i fall asleep early trying to escape the world I live in. The only time I'm at peace is in my sleep. Feeling depressed every minute of every day is so tiring and draining, I dont know what to do anymore. I have hardly any friends, the ones I had are no longer friends with me, school is one of the scariest places as i feel like everyone hates me. I have a boyfriend who I love with all my heart and he doesnt love me the same way back. I give the relationship everything I have and he puts in nothing, at times i feel like he's only with me if he wants something. Its so hard giving so much and never getting any effort back. I am a selfless person, always put everyone else before myself and my needs and every time it back fires on me. sometimes i just wish some body would love and care about me the way I love and care about people, I want someone to take the time out of their day and see how I'm truly going but no one ever does. I try talking to my boyfriend about all this but he doesnt have any time and the friends i do have well there sick of hearing about it. So what I do is lock myself away from everyone and just cry because i have all this pain and sadness and I dont know what to do with it. I dont know what to do anymore

By now, my friends, you may be aware that I came to BB following the breakdown of my marriage of 24 years. At first, I believed it was this breakdown and her departure that was the source of the my pain. At first.
Since coming to BB and opening up to all you kind people. Reading how others are struggling day-to-day also, many a lot longer than I; and some a lot tougher too. I have come to realise that I am not alone. I have learnt that I am not as useless that I once thought I was. That there just might be a better tomorrow out there somewhere, someday. 
Though some days I may still have my doubts, I know that I just need to get past these bad days and the good days are just around the corner. I try to see this akin to when I quit smoking way-back-when. These bad days are just like the nicotine withdrawal symptoms; a craving for garbage that will pass.
Reading everyone's posts, the regulars, the irregulars, the new people and the once-off, each time I learn more about myself. Each post and each thread sinks in a little, and changes me a little. The BB forums are the most moving and tearful experience of my week. It is where I reconnect to a world that I have had disconnected from all those years ago. I got so caught up in my own world: my wife and that I had forgotten about everyone else.
Now, after my wife has departed and I have only my children and a need to maintain a normalcy for them. I find that I have a lot of time to reflect on years gone by. In this reflection, I fear that I have been living in one of those so called one-side relationships that WK has spake of in his other recent thread. Or maybe it was more likely to be where my wife and I were each living in our own one-sided relationship, but neither of them were connecting.
It was so depressing being told by the doc that I am depressed. And it was even more depressing when he told me that he wants me to go on ADs for the next six to twelve months. I thought to myself, ""Just what I need, to be kicked further down when I was already feeling down."" No, I am not ready for this type of treatment; I'll work with the psychologist first.
Anyhow, I'm not starting the ADs just yet. As I have had an epiphany. I am will be exploring with the psych of the next few weeks if it was the presence of the marriage that caused the depression and not
the absence of the marriage. And, if that were true, would not then, the absence of it empower me to lift myself up without the meds?

I don't know what to do anymore. I have no sense of direction in life and I don't have any idea what to do with my life anymore. I just don't want to be here as it is too painful to be alive constantally worrying about what I need to be doing job wise and figuring out what I want to do. I have no goals anymore and no motivation. I have seeked professional help and nothing seems to work. I just don't want to be here anymore. When I talk to someone all I hear is ""it will get better"" ""it's all right something will work out"" but it's been like this for years.

  Hey all, 

Warning. Looooong story

First time here at BB im not really sure what to say but for most my life since early teen years to present (25) ive had a mental illness.  (i think) ive never been to a shrink or even a doctor. My poor husband cops alot of my mood swings and moments where all i do is cry. 

Im not very educated on it all but all i can say is i can only see the negative on most things. Some days im the happiest person but then something could pop up in my head from the past and there goes the happy mood. Ive had a fairly good childhood although my mother suffered from bad depression and alcoholism which led to gambling problems etc. Shes got it all under control now which is great but its left me in a shitty place as i had to deal with ALOT of it as i grew up. Id also always protect my brother so alot of times id push away my emotions and comfort him. But now theyre all catching up with me.  yay. 

Im married to the best man in the world (haha) i have a beautiful 2yo daughter. And my life is good. 
I feel so guilty being like this on and off happy/sad/angry they both dont deserve it. I dont want anything to rub off on my little one either. Remembering me as a miserable person. 

My head just feels cloudy and i am constantly putting myself down over every little thing.  I could type for hours but i feel like a whinger as i know theres people out there without food for example and people that are in devastating circumstances. But i want to feel happy and give my family the best life i can. 

I guess im scared and embarrassed to talk about it to anyone. My husband knows but theres only so much he can do. Ive recently met some really good quality friends but they arent aware. 

Im worried if i go on antidepressants i wont be me anymore. Ill be a zombie. I love who i am. And i just want to get rid of that heavy clouded mind and focus on the positives as lifes too short. 

Also the funny thing is id love to get into mental health as a career as i love helping people. So id like to sort my own head out first. Can taking antidepressants effect getting into a role like this? Do you Have to tell people. For example if i wanted to foster a child would this be a problem if i was on antidepressants? 

Are there certain ones that are better or is it up to the doc to decide. 

Please only nice comments i know that was a whole lot of confusion. Im not the best at expressing myself  

Thanks 💙💙💙

I don’t understand what is wrong with me or why it happens to me but i’m always the one that gets ignored and i’m always the one that gets left out or forgotten with friends and family! I am one of four girls but i’m the odd one out and have been my whole life and I can’t deal with it anymore I am so hurt but at the same time i’m almost numb 
I just want to know why my family would treat me like this if they didn’t actually hate me

Im sitting here listening to my family play on the xbox an I feel so distant. I feel horrible that I am such a failure at being a dad and I am repeating all the same mistakes that my stepfather did with me. I can speak to them. Theres too much in my head to fit out my mouth. I try and then I clam up. Also I feel frustrated by them. Why cant the see whats wrong with me? A hug and a kiss isnt going to fix it. Sometimes i think they dont even care and they want me to leave. I cant call my mum because ive ignored her for too long. Same as my brother. Every time the phone rings I just freeze. I feel like such a waste of time and money. I changed careers and now I dont earn enough for us and every decision I make sends us backwards. I cant even open facebook because everyone is having such a great time. Whats worse is they post the RUOK messages but they dont really care about someone who needs help. But why would they help me anyway because I have pushed everyone away. I dont know what to do. My head is spinning and I cant find any silence. I cant face work but I cant afford to take days off. The job I do has me responsible for peoples lives not that im going to hurt anyone but I really cant focus with whats going on. I just want some silence. Im so stressed about money and health and dying. Im stressed about being a good dad and husband. I just want to be taken away from all this. I was thinkin of going to the hospital but I dont know what good it would do. I am ashamed and embarrassed and confused. Negative thoughts creep into my head all the time. Ill be having a great time and laughing and then all of a sudden my chest will drop and thoughts will enter my head like ""whats the point of all this, you are going to die soon anyway"".

Thought I'd open up the discussion for anyone interested. Mostly for those of us who experience the highs and lows.
Not limited to BPD issues but also anyone else who experiences different levels.
For example, I get a cold chill and tingles everywhere when a low is coming on. It's like the life is draining out of me. That's when I can tell I'm about to hit a downward spiral.
Then once this passes and I look back I can't help but feel some degree of shame (despite staying silent about it) by looking back and almost feeling stupid for feeling the way I was. I haven't worked out a fix for this one yet.
The highs are easy to pick. I'm on my feet constantly with a fleet of huge plans and ideas. At work I'm busy, productive and firing off a thousand emails to various people almost being demanding in my approach. Work and socially I'm shooting my mouth off with near inappropriate things that fortunately haven't landed me into too much trouble. Although over time I've learned to try and control it and realise when it's happening so I step back, take a breath, read that email before hitting send and often end up deleting it instead knowing what's happening to me, biting my tongue before blurting out an opinion.
How do some others feel when they are transitioning and what do they do to intervene themselves?

hi everyone, 
I am very new to this and I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. My name is May and I have been living with depression for the last 8 years. I probably had it for longer but I was diagnosed in 2009.  I really thought I had gotten everything under control over the last two years but since I slowly weened myself off of anti-depressants I have had a bicycle accident which resulted in fractures that necessitated me taking time off work and needing to push my studies back (I am now very behind my full time studies and I have assignments and exam revision I am trying to do which has been incredibly stressful).  I also feel very behind at work because I had to take a significant amount of time off and I didn't have much leave due to being relatively new with my employer.  I think the injury and subsequent time off work and well feeling useless and isolated has not been very helpful. I haven't been able to exercise and my eating hasn't been great which I know would not be helping me right now. I have been finding myself feeling quick to anger and I feel like i am full of negative emotions (I've never been an angry person so this is a very new thing to feel anger as a response to stimuli that would never make me angry). I am so ashamed of how I am feeling and I have been hashing over my past mistakes and things I have done when I know I should have known better. Instead of forgiving myself, I am dragging myself over the coals and punishing myself for not being a better person.  I am not proud of the person I have been at times in the past and although I have made many positive changes I am not allowing myself to forgive and move on. I even know that its not right and I should forgive myself but on the inside I don't feel worthy,   It's like I keep punishing myself even though I would and have forgiven others for much worse.  I look at myself as a person who lacks integrity a as a result of my past and I am struggling to reconcile that my future is all that matters. I just feel like I am in a really dark place and I am already dreading the fact that I have to go to work on Monday and put on a brave face when all I want to do is cry. I am sorry to share such a negative story but I didn't know where else to go. 
thank you everyone

Hi everyone,
I just wanted to post because I'm not having the best time lately.. I recently graduated with a uni degree, have moved to a new city and got a new proper career job and for some reason I'm just so unhappy.
When I was living in my old city with my parents I was unhappy too and I couldn't wait to move away and start a new job and a new life somewhere else and just be done with uni and studying all together. But, now that I'm here I feel horrible. My job was so draining even for the first week and I'm missing so many things about my old home. I just don't feel right and it feels awful. I just wonder if I'm ever going to feel okay, it's like no matter what I do I find something negative about it and I try to look at the positives but the negatives are so strong that it just does nothing..
I just wish I knew what to do.. I don't know if I'm following the right career path anymore and I don't know if this is why.. I hate the idea of sitting at a computer screen all day but this is what I'm doing and it feels so unfulfilling and like such a waste of time. I wish I could be helping people in some way but unfortunately that is not what I studied :/ I don't know if i want to be in a big city or if I want to be somewhere quiet and peaceful like my old home.. I just feel so lost and confused and just wish I could feel happy for once and I'm not..

So, I feel like I might be depressed and I have been feeling this way for a while and I've tried talking to my mum about it (No well on my behalf), and I've tried talking to my friends about it (But we are basically screwed up and it leads to nowhere). I really just need someone to talk to. I want to talk to someone to tell them how I feel without feeling guilty about talking about how I feel instead of talking to someone else, but I don't even know what I would say. I know I need to speak to someone, but I don't know what to say and every time I try and write something down, all the thoughts in my head just leave. I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say, and I feel so guilty about this. I don't want to be a burden to the people around me, I just want to feel normal again. I don't know what to do.

I was doing well until I wasn't. Our Mum died suddenly 2 years ago in October and our Pop passed away a year ago. I terminated a pregnancy in my early 20's which haunts me everyday. I'm normally a very bubbly, happy person.. So to be feeling numb at the moment, like I'm crazy, like I should just be able to get over it all. But this time, I can't. I've seen a doctor and he's increased my medication but I still don't feel any better and I just want to sleep. What is wrong with me 😔

Hi
 
So in June of this year I stopped taking my anti depressants. I was on and off for 3 years and I just wanted to get it out of my life.
Ever since I stopped I've been gradually spiralling down. And I know that's what happens but I don't even catch myself most days. My approach for my anxiety, panic attacks, and depression was to meditate and breathe and that kinda stuff.
This week I've been extra depressed. I just don't care about anything, I can't be bothered, I don't have energy to do anything. And it's definitely bringing me back to years ago when I was at my lowest point in my depression.
And I haven't gotten better since. Like things have improved and whatever but I haven't changed overall. Anyway so the issue is I went on a bender (alcohol, drugs that I have never done before). And I cheated on my boyfriend. He and I have had issues with this in the past. But it came out of nowhere. 
I just wasnt thinking. I don't feel like myself. I don't have any enjoyment for anything. Its like the past few days I've transformed into someone else. Like someone has taken over my thoughts and actions and I've just been watching the entire time.
I don't know why this started. I have been in a bit of a limbo stage because I recently graduated and now I'm just floating aimlessly until the next thing. But I don't know what I want.
I'm just racked with guilt and shame and frustration. And now my boyfriend broke up with me, or taking a break, or whatever is happening. Which makes sense. I just want to be at peace. I don't know why I've been acting like this lately. It's out of character. It isn't me. I don't know what to say or think. I'm really upset that I ruined my relationship by doing stupid things. But it's like I just don't care. Deep down i do but it's easy to ignore it.
I don't want to take medication again. I don't think it would help with this. Especially since I've come this far.

Depression – rearing its ugly head
I think I have had depression since my mid twenties but seemed to manage having youth on my side, a good job, travelling overseas and a lovely family and friends.
In my late twenties I had a long period where I suffered, anxiety and not being able to cope with every day life, driving recklessly in the car and not really caring one way or another.

I was on anti-depressants and whilst this helped me get better, I did have some under-lying issues and a quick temper. I ended up quitting and after a holiday to Hawaii I went home and went about setting up my own business. It was very costly and trying but on the first day of trading I ended up with a good business and loved the independence and freedom it gave me. My former boss felt very threatened so he complained to the council and I had to apply for a permit, in the end it was granted minus not being to have clients around. I still had them around but was
The worst period of my depression was in Dec 2016 when I did a contract 2 week role in Cairns looking after a permanent letting building, it was an absolute disaster and I ended up walking out after week one as it was untenable. I avoided everyone. Did not want to go out, down the street nothing. I tried to work again at 2 more resorts and they fell through as I was still not myself. I was so anxious everything was an effort. My mum suffered dearly because of my depression. I couldn’t cook, clean or even read a magazine. I kept on watching movies over and over, staying still in bed, not washing or cleaning my teeth for 2-3 days. It was horrendous nothing like this had ever happened so severely like this before.
It went on until the end of April, finally I was up to working again and within 2 days had a job 2 days a week and then 3 days a week. I never thought I would get out of this black hole. Eventually I did and realised I will be ok. I started being kind to myself, buying some new clothes, booking a holiday, getting in touch with friends again.
I know how you feel, never never give up. There is always hope.

Hi all, I'll be brief:
Primary issue: I often wake up zombified in the mornings. I experience a lack of energy and motivation & often find my self vegging out until the early afternoon. Sometimes I feel like I have a cloud in my head. Struggle to be fully engaged in the activities I take part in - consequently simple and dull tasks can often be difficult/irritating to get through. When I'm put under stress for an extended period of time (especially at work), I've found I often get scatter brained - and there has been instances where my mind has been so fatigued I've experienced a kind of 'concentration shut down' - were tasks that would take me a few seconds begin to take over 5 minutes (i.e like sending a short email).
Attempted solutions: 
-Seen GP. Sleep study done with sleep specialist- no serious diagnosis. 
-MRI done and is clean. 
-Have attempted morning excercise, which has sometimes proved effective, but other times has had little effect (often getting out of bed and doing sport feels impossible)
-Meditation & Diary - few times a week - helps but not so much with fatigue/consciousness issue.
-Coffee - works for 1hr but then I tend to crash - typically try to stay away from it but the caffeine is often necessary to maintain the standard required at work.
-Goal setting/task management - I've made attempts to write out tasks and set goals, which helps with the 'must-do' weekly activities - but I simply don't have the level of interest or engagement required to commit to a self-set long term Goal on a daily basis.
The issue largely began last year when:
-Father passed away
-Had to manage an estate which I was largely unprepared for
-promoted at work which meant an large increase in responsiblity (and stress) 
-Had to move homes (went from managing a share home to living with my mother)
-falling out with long term friend/partner 
While it's been a trying time and I've undoubtedly experienced bouts of depression along with grief - I've refused to engage in suicidal ideation and feel a strong sense of wanting to improve myself and my situation to the best of my ability.
Once again my primary concern is my capacity for conscious attention and my ability to be motivated enough to follow through on achieving longer term goals. While I'm certain that last year's events are strongly related to this issue and that depression may be one of the underlying causes for it, I also can't help but shake off the feeling that it may be physiological in nature.

Hi,
i am new here and I am struggling. 
I have a great life but 2 years ago I got to a breaking point and saw a doctor and then a psychologist. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I felt isolated. Ever time I went he would give me titles of books to read which I couldn't find the motivation to read and in the end I stopped going.
flash forward 2 years and I am struggling, I feel numb. I lost it at work and embarrassed myself and said some horrible things about people I like and about a job I used to like.
i feel constantly stressed and part of that comes down to keeping my mask on laughing at the right times and trying to keep calm and carry on.
i opened up to my partner and told him how I felt and he was great.
i made an appointment to see a gp and cancelled it in the morning and I don't know why?
i know I need help, I know I want to feel better but I have no motivation to do so.
i just feel so lost and unmotivated and flat.

Majority of the time and I hate it 😣 I feel like I should be happy. I can't talk to my fiance about it because he doesn't understand it all, my brother has diagnosed depression and he's said he doesn't understand why he has it when he's got a great family etc. I feel so guilty admitting i'm sad 😣 just been slowing going south for a while now slowly. I get into sad periods then all of sudden I seem to ""snap"" back to happy and I feel all emotional and grateful for everything, but it goes away. Things i used to like doing I can't do anymore. Even tasks like cooking i used to enjoy i absolutely loathe doing it now. I feel drained all the time and just cannot be bothered cleaning so the house is always messy :( used to be so clean :( my fiance does not clean at all, and little one likes to throw things in all directions. I was trying to lose weight. I lost 10kgs and then stopped and i keep trying to start again but I self sabotage and go on a binge and then go eh well you ate something bad may as well stop and its just been thing cycle of this this whole year -.- i don't have support around me, my fiance says ""do whatever makes you happy"" but that's all, he wants different meals to me (but he doesnt cook) and my 2.5yo doesn't like majority of food so i have to cook 3 meals so i give up and just cook something unhealthy :( i constantly feel like people don't really care about me. Example, I asked my mum out for coffee this weekend but she said she needed to go buy shoes at local kmart (2 mins down road) so she can't this weekend :/ my fiance used to tell me i'm pretty/beautiful, and used to say thankyou for doing things and genuinely mean it but does not anymore. I have 1 good friend. She's great but I know she talks about me behind my back. I thought i had friends at the gym. But i got a job at my gym, looking at kids (childcare worker in training) and now no one talks to me, they drop kids off, go to the class I used to go to with them, and then pick their kids up and go have a catch up together while I work :( so guess they totally forgot about me and I feel like that's fair enough because i'm not that interesting :( there is a group on facebook and they create events for catch ups and 'invite' all members who do the classes, and leave me out. sorry long post. I don't know if I should see someone or what 😣😣😣

I am new to this site and forum. I have been reading some of the contributions to the depression threads. One in particular talked about the difficulties of living with 'anhedonia', after trying a full range of different therapeutic approaches. Unfortunately I can't find the post again! I just wanted to say that I am very familiar with the concept of anhedonia - the inability to enjoy anything that once brought joy to you.  I have major depression and have been living with it for most of my life.  I have found it difficult to be really free of depression, despite medication, cognitive therapy, support groups, hospitalisation, ect, psychologist, psychiatrists and so forth.  I also noticed a thread asking about the phenomenon of mood swings from the morning depression, to feeling better later in the day. I understand this to be the diurnal nature of some depressions - the daily rhythm of major depression, which tends to get better as the day progresses, being worse in the mornings.  I know this rhythm very well too. At this stage I am not going to comment on how I manage these two s symptoms, but I just wanted to say that there is at least one other person in the forum that knows how this feels!

So I'm depressed and anxious been like this for about 4 years now. 
My psychologist has suggested on talking to my mother about it, and how I feel about her and what she's done to me in the past and now. 
One thing is I can't. I can't open up to her because I'm afraid she will shut me down. Any suggestions on how I should go 'hey mum I'm depressed, anxious, on meds, thanks for not believing me, thanks for not being there'

Never have been one for publicly posting my problems or even talking about them but I have started to realize I have to think and do things differently now. 
I hated who I had become, I hated my life, I hated the relationship I was in, I hated everything except for my kids. I wasnt a bad person though I have done some horrible things in my early years and a few horrible things have happened to me, made some bad mistakes and have made some great decisions too, I had a very good life by society's standard but i was severely depressed. I couldnt understand me.
Almost 12 months ago I deliberately threw myself into the deep end, I left my life as I knew it to really focus and search 100% for answers, to search for peace, freedom and understanding. F%^K I felt so scared, ashamed, guilty, hopeless, you name it ..........I've had a few  earth shattering heart breaking moments in my life but this felt like facing death by being eaten alive by a pack of lions, no has my back, no one there to catch me, I never felt anyone had ever been there anyway, but deep down I thought this would be the best thing for me, sink or swim.Divorce, it wasnt working anyway, I knew her like the back of my hand but felt she never knew me. I didnt know me. No job, we were in business together. A major back injury so finding employment is close to impossible. I took the camping gear and tools and we split the cash 50/50. I had $16K and the unknown ahead of me. 
I refuse to get government handouts but don't have a problem with others receiving it, I just see it as a extra hassle I dont need, nothing to say i wont apply later, I hope i wont have too.
Took the journey back into my life to process who I am, read higher conscious books, other's life stories, understanding why people turn to religion, TED Talks, Mind Spot program, self help, divorce support group, blogs, nature, exercise, eating healthy though we always have, reduce alcohol though now I haven't touch it for a while, quit smoking though I do vape now. I had been searching for that holy grail that silver bullet my councillor calls it. There is no holy grail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! after almost 12 months I'm back to square one!!!!!!!!!!!!or am I? I've worked out that I am me, what works you my not me, what works for you my not for me, that doesnt make us better or worse, we just want to get through life better than how it has been. I think it's starting to get a little better, maybe a little clearer. 
I now need to find my new purpose.

I wasn't sure where to put this but i am feeling desperate and was hoping to find some people who have had a gambling problem in the past so they can share what they did to tackle it completely.
It has gotten to the stage where i don't feel i should be working because i just keep feeding the addiction. i work hard and then all the money is gone because i am a idiot. Something in my mind gets triggered and decides to convince me its okay to keep going back etc and i also chase my loses everytime. But i know its not about the money because when i do win it goes straight back in. i also Justify my own actions and its just a vicious cycle. I have anxiety and depression but the aftermath of gambling makes it 100 x worse. I dont understand why i cant just stop.
Ive finally admitted i have a problem. I can't talk to anyone else as i know they will definitely not understand.
Any advice would be great. Also i do see a pyschologist but i am even embarrased to bring it up to them.

Hi community, 
not sure what to do or say, instead of negative feeding on negativity - but reading some of the issues people are experiencing is making me lift some of my spirits.
is this normal? Are my symptoms of possible anxiety or depression not really there? 
is it (as my wife says) all in my head?

I am still struggling with ever day.
I honestly don't feel I'm living anymore and go with the motion of day to day things and eat work sleep. I dont know how long I'll grieve for my little brother as it's been a yr. I still think it's a nightmare and I'm the one who has died and this is hell.  As 6 months after I lay my grandpa to rest then as I unwind after work two days after my grandpa's funeral my partner of 5 years walks in the house to state he doesn't love me.. I am lost now with my heart broken so much. I have no feeling but despair. My life has changed so much in less then a year and I feel like I live in absolute hell. At work I am lost and frail. While weekends leave me lonely with no interest.. I feel I just waste my days and let life pass me.. when will this pain and suffering end

I have been asking myself lately why I can't be happy. I'm starting to feel like maybe I want to be depressed. Am I a glutton for punishment.
I have had a horrible couple of years. I'm struggling to trust my husband. I'm struggling to bond with my 8 year old. I feel like I'm only capable of being close to my 3 year old. I feel like I've gone from one heartache to the next without having a chance to stop and take a breath.
I keep finding evidence that my husband intends to cheat but he denies it forcefully. My 8 year olds father and his wife refused to give him back at the beginning of the year during the holidays forcing me to take them to court and then retrieve my kid from school first day back. They made my life miserable for months. I live in a rural town with no friends to speak of and no family close enough to turn to. I've never felt more alone in my life.
Ive been in therapy and I'm on anti-depressants but it feels like nothing is helping. I don't understand why I always feel depressed, incapable of finding happiness in my life.
I dont want to feel miserable anymore! But, I don't know how to help myself anymore......

I guess I just need to get this off my chest. There's a billion things I could say but, one of them is just being unable to be happy no matter what I do. 
I've had severe depression for three years, and I'm fairly sure I had a less severe type of depression before it became severe, I just don't know for how long I had it.
Anyway, I'm rarely excited about anything anymore no matter how hard I try to keep myself happy and busy with things to do. I indulge in activities that I enjoy and even go outside my comfort zone every once in a while but I'm still unhappy. 
And I know it's just the depression doing that, I know that if I wasn't depressed I would be more happy and motivated and feel like the doing the things that I know I want to do.
I know nobody can be happy all the time but it just doesn't feel right when I'm unhappy in times where I'd usually be excited or motivated. 
Holidays don't make me happy. Events don't make me happy. Buying stuff I really want or playing video games makes me pretend I'm happy but I can't actually feel it. Art used to make me feel imaginative and creative. Even hanging with friends, I feel like I'm not really there. I try sooo hard to be happy or excited or glad etc. about things, but in the end I really don't actually feel any of it.
I guess I really want to also ask if taking medication helps with this feeling or if I'll become more apathetic. I just want to be happy. Really that's all I care about anymore. I want to feel like my life is worth it again. 
Any success stories (or even non successful stories) people can share with me? Has anyone started being happy after dealing with severe depression? (I say severe because even some of my depressed friends don't understand me not being happy because they don't have the same severity of depression I guess) 
I'm really hoping that seeing a psychiatrist goes well for me. I just need that hope I suppose.

Hello, 
Having a rough time mentally at the moment.
work is sucking my motivation. It's not so much that the job I have now is bad but from past experiences with other jobs it triggers my depressive episodes.
Right now I'm in my 5th year of a 4 year electrical apprenticeship with my third employer. The reasoning for such a long stint is due to redundancies and abuse of power (IMO). I have lost my motivation. My grades in school are declining and the roadmap for completion, although only a few months, seems long difficult and somewhat questionable.
It began with a redundency and then the following employer pulling me out of school for over 6 months under the threat of losing my job. However I re-enrolled after repeated requests to go back to school which I was subsequently fired over. Went down the avenues of fair work but it just seemed like too much hassel. 
I continued to go to school to finish the year knowing I was six months behind. Finished the semester and after the Chrissy break I went to enrol again. Problem was I was unemployed so I couldn't re-enrol. What's worse is the previous semester didnt count as it was a two part module. So I would have to restart the module again. Another 6 months added and an additional $700. 
Managed to find an employer again but had to wait an additional 3 months before I could even start the full year I was behind on. 
so here I am now. Possibly less than 3 months from completion before I can sit my final exams and I am at breaking point. Another annoying thing is I believe the TAFE haven't included a module in my roadmap. A module which will take and additional few months to complete.
Even when I finish the course work there's still 6 more months just prepping for the final exams. All this added time whilst earning minimum wage has just destroyed me.
I have been struck down with pnemonia and have been off work for a week. I need to take more time off but I don't believe Ill have a job if I do. But to tell you the truth, I almost don't really care. I'm just so fed up. This apprentiship just doesn't seem to end despite the effort. So now it's not so much employment that is screwing me its the TAFE. My current boss seems like a good bloke but I just can't trust him.
All this with a family to support is becoming too much. My parents are well off so financially we are pretty secure, it is more an issue of relying on others which is shameful and embarrassing. 
Not the full history but as relevant as can be.

Picture this... I bounced my ball so high it landed over a wall. I climbed the top of it. I can see the ball clearly. I know exactly where it is. All I have to do is get it. I am frozen! I swipe at the ball from the top of the wall with my arms crossing over each time. I can't grab it because it's too far away. I can't push my brain to make the effort to get the actuall ball.
This is how I feel. I was once well groomed always had pride in my appearance and so many other great things. Now, I don't even care anymore. I can't be bothered getting out of bed yet I am super ashamed if anyone would ever see me like this. I am getting further and further away as each day passes. I want my old self back so badly but it's over the wall....

Hello guys, I'm a 41 year old male. I've been suffering from mental health issues most of my life, sever anxiety and depression. I've been shuffled around from GP to GP, different psychologists, I just can't find the right help. The psychologists I've seen were very unprofessional, as the sessions were supposed to last for an hour, but they would see patients for only 10-15 mins, patients would be told to turn up at the same appointment times. Very unprofessional. I received no feedback and have been left to feel like I can't receive help that I need.
I changed my GP and he referred me to a new therapist, I have waited more than 3 months, and still haven't received any notice of when I start my first session. I'm sick of this.
Is there anyone on this site that can please put me in touch with a GP in Melbourne that specialises in mental health and who can start me with a new psychologist or psychiatrist? I'm at my wits end. I can't go private, has to be bulk billing as I don't currently work. I'm receiving unemployment benefits. Thanks in advance.

Hi,
This is a real bug bear of mine that in the 21 Century there is still a stigma attached to mental illness and there shouldn't be.
What's the difference between that and any other illness?  There isn't one.  They are all illness that can be debilitating and require medical and specialist support.
The stigma just shouldn't be there and can be removed by talking openly and being more educated.
That's why Beyondblue and other support networks need to be successful.
Thanks,
Aeoifa

Hello, I apologise if this doesn't make much sense. I've not been posting much because I've been struggling to work out what I'm struggling with. And after a couple of weeks (or days? time passes in a funny way now), I'm half a step closer to figuring it out.
So I feel like I'm frozen in some sort of bubble. What I mean by that is nothing I do seems to affect anyone outside of me. I don't really work while at work, and no one seems to notice. I don't talk to friends, and they don't talk to me back. Even when I try to break the isolation a bit, it's like I'm not really reaching anybody. Even if I try to think about myself, I get stuck so I'm not even in touch with myself.
I am more venting than anything. I had a psychologist appointment on Saturday and we're now meeting twice a week. I shut down completely in my last appointment - involuntarily. My mind just wouldn't let me think or talk when we started getting close to something that must've been...hard. But the trouble is I don't actually remember what it was anymore. I know I need to keep going to each appointment and I genuinely look forward to them...but I'm quite tired now.
I've tried ways of grounding myself but they only help me feel connected to the physical environment. Not other people's minds and emotions, and I need that.
James

I'm isolated pretty much 24/7, still live at home with my parents. One has PTSD the other has depression, so it's rarely a happy household.  My dad has nit picked at me for as long as I can remember. Now my brother who is a drug addict has moved back in. I told my family how angry I was that he was moving back in and they just jumped down my throat and got angry at me. When the reason I felt angry was because I know how much stress it will put on everyone and because I so badly want some happiness within the household. I have no job as I have chronic fatigue, any friends I make I seem to end up losing. I've tried getting a job suitable for me but with no success, then I started to get more migraines and was diagnosed with costochrondritis. I feel like no matter what I do, something is always there holding me back. I feel like the only friends I have left don't want to be around me. I've thought about possibly moving out into a sharehouse or something but I can't imagine anyone would want to live with someone like me. 
I'm on medication and I've seen my doctor about it but she isn't much help anymore. I'm tired of feeling depressed, lonely, I'm tired of being in pain. I'm tired of always being in my own head, listening to the negative thoughts over and over again. I'm tired of seeing how unhappy people in my family are and I'm somehow expected to feel happy regardless of it all. Now I'm concerned my brother will take his life and there's nothing I can do about it.  And it's hard because I know how he feels deep down. I feel like it's just a matter of time that someone in my family will take their own life, I just don't know who it'll be. Maybe it'll be me. 
I'm so tired of feeling worthless, feeling like I'm incapable of such simple things. I'm tired of people putting me down. I'm tired of the counselling appointments, the medication changes, the side effects. I'm tired of not getting anywhere. And instead I just suffer. I don't know where to go from here but disappearing definitely looks more appealing than anything else right now. Decided I'll just stay away from the only friends I do have, I don't feel like they want to be around me anyway and I don't want to bring them down. I also don't want them to only hangout with me because they feel bad.
I've had enough. I'm so over my life and I don't see anyway out.

Lets get into it then:
Over the past month ive had to face some extremely hard truths about myself and my mental health as a part of trying to move forward and better my quality of life.
1) I dont find a SINGLE thing funny anymore - jokes, TV, Movies, social gstherings etc. 
2) connected to the above, I find myself fake lauging at everything - to the point where my face and throat hurts.
3) I am a perfect chameleon. Im able to blend into any kind of sub culture I am currently around. But nothing feels natural.
4) I lack symapthy and empathy for most people apart from family. Infact emotion has become extremely vacant for me as a whole.
 
Countless times I have been to a doctor. And countless times its just resulted in nothing - you know the drill ""heres some SSRIs and see me in a month"" - the follow up just results in an increased dose that makes me angry and impotent (not joking). 
Basically long story short i have a complete apathy for life and its growing worse and worse. I just dont know what to do. Is this what real life is??

Hi,
I'm 41 and having the worst year of my life.
My Dad passed away 11 months ago after since that event I went on a downward spiral into clinical depression and anxiety. It got so bad that I was hospitalised.
I had 12 treatments of ECT and discharged. I'm still battling depression and get angry and teary at times. My girlfriend has left me recently and I am feeling lost.
I am religious and feel I'm being punished by a higher power for a relationship I had with a married woman 16 years ago.
I regret a lot about my life and want a fresh start but am anxious about taking the next step. I feel I have wasted so many opportunities in my life and I've left things too late.
I am going to the gym and practising mindfulness but now it's school holidays (I'm a teacher) I begin ruminating and beginning the ""What ifs"".
Thanks for reading.

I dont know about anyone else but Im always having a battle with myself. My good side of my brain helps me with positive thoughts and tries to inspire me and then my bad side of my brain tells me negative thoughts and feelings,when this happens it makes my life very difficult. For example if Im trying to leave the house to go to an appointmentmy good side will pump me up with positive talk and then in comes the bad side of my brain telling me that I cant do it. Im sure other people may experience these feelings, if anyones got any helpful ideas on coping methods it would be appreciated. I always say I feel like I'm in a constant battle with myself.
Thanx
Annie

Hi,
Not sure how to start? Didnt think I'd make it this morning but it's now 3.50pm SA time and have finally made it through to the other side of these apocalyptic episodes. It's really hard to stay positive, it's always uphill battle, it's a relentless war inside the mind but I know I just have to stay alive long enough for it to pass. I'm tired, lonely, and sometimes frightened but I've hung in there again, just. 
I would really give my soul to devil to stop this.
Thanks for reading.

Hello everyone,
For reasons I can't fathom...I find myself without a person to lean on....
About life; Youngest of four, dad with addictive/abusive behaviour, met an aussie online/met/married at 18, came to Oz at 19, husband had addictive/abusive behaviour, stayed married 18 years, had 4 children to him, went to Tafe for nursing diploma, workplace bullying twice, cracked/had time off/ got medicated, seperated/divorced, isolated, self destructive behaviour when kids were with their dad, settled down (mostly), met a new man in another country (been overseas twice), engaged, pregnant, no friends, extremely depressed/hormonal/emotional, fiance can't ""just come over"" Because he wasn't born in a first world country, no family here....
No best friend.
I have tried reaching out to others about where I'm at and I'm constantly being rejected.
I invited 23 ppl from work to my home for a short notice barbeque....I got 14 ""nos"" and 0 ppl turn up. I tried joining a newbie motorcycle club but honestly no one was very helpful or Interested.
My best friend disowned me because she didn't support my pregnancy....but it turns out after almost two years of trying she's 3 weeks more pregnant than me. Also she said I'm a bad parent because I went to my fiance twice because he couldn't get approved for a visitor's visa here and not taking my kids on expensive holidays (that I can't afford) makes me a bad parent in her opinion. She was like a sister to me....and it feels like she died....so I'm still really hurting and grieving that. 
I see an antenatal social worker at the hospital. I've done the mental health assessment with my GP.
I struggle with wanting someone and not wanting to be a burden or be dependent.
Im going to end up being alone in the delivery room in March....
And maybe for a couple years til my guy can come over...if he comes over....he's not talking to me right now...""for the good of our relationship"" because I'm so angry/broken....
Evwryone will say get more help, get more help....but it feels cheap knowing the only ppl that will ""care"" about you are getting paid to do so.....

I have dealt with depression and anxiety all my life on and off.  I understand if so much more now and have so many more tools in my tool box which means that life is generally much better than ever before.  However right now I am really struggling and I feel so alone.  ""The sadness"" (what I call is because it is just a deep overwhelming sadness) and the constant gut churning anxiety is back.  It just shows up whenever it feels like it out of the blue.  It snatches away my resolve and my confidence and leaves me feeling like a vulnerable, frightened child who is alone.  When it gets me like this I feel helpless.  I know however that I'm not helpless and that there are things I can do to help myself feel better.  maybe as human beings we are meant to experience polarities, like hot and cold, happy and sad, so that we can appreciate the difference between the two....

I have recently been reminded of when depression started for me . I was 14 angry , confused empty and full of self hatred. I just didn't operate how others did. I felt to deeply. I remember thinking at the time were was this youth of carefree times in the sun everyone seemed to talk about. If this was the best years I din't want to be around for long. I made no plans for the future and by 16 had decided I had nothing to offer and the world had nothing to offer me. I was different and felt for sure that wasn't ok
Thankfully I got though those years in high school but it was not till in my early twenties that i was properly diagnosed,medication took a bit longer to sort out.
When i finally got the right support my life changed and i felt like i came alive for the first time since early childhood. I am so grateful for sticking around in life,for having people who believed in me and encouraged me toward the right support.
Today I am struggling again ,the difference is I have hope that I will pull though and it won't last forever . One moment at a time if its all that one can bare and a little bit of hope and a dash of gratitude  . Some times I lived that one and that's ok .

Hi there. 
I just need someone to talk to. I have no friends and I can't open up to my boyfriend. I'm currently in a relationship with a man 25 years older than me who has a cocaine addiction. I do love him but it is really hard. He is very selfish and does not show me any love and affection but I rely on him financially as I have no where else to stay at the moment. I recently found out I was pregnant to his baby and he does not want it and I am getting a termination tomorrow. I am a very emotional person so it is hard for me to hold in all of this and when I have outbursts and cry he tells me he can't deal with me anymore. 
I just want to be loved and cared for like I care for him. He can be verbally abusive sometimes and he said I'm annoying and I whine a lot and I have no self confidence. 
I don't want to leave him I just need help on how to deal with a man like him.

I'm sorry if my post is a little muddled but, not really use to writing like this...
I was diagnosed with depression last year after enduring over 5 years of bullying from my classmates. I remember just sitting in class and having my first nervous breakdown. I just started hyperventilating and crying because one of my bullies called me a fag. it was one of the most embarrassing moments of my life.
my school wasn't helpful, they didn't get that I was getting bullied because of my sexuality but always talked me into not pressing criminal charges against them. I felt like such a coward but I was scared.
Since I was diagnosed, my school forced me to move into distance education because they were concerned about the ramifications of my behaviour. they told me it was in ''my best interest'' but I think they just wanted to get rid of me before I killed myself or something. I've lost all of my friends and I basically have no social life.
at the moment:
-I've got NO FRIENDS
-I've screwed up my VCE courses again
-I'm having problems with my appearance
-I'm having difficulty with anger issues
I didn't know who else to turn to, I just wanted to talk to someone who isn't going to judge me.
I just want a friend....

After discussing with my new senior manager and another manager how we could support an employee going through a mentally challenging time, my boss made the most alarming statements. She said she understood anxiety but she did not get depression & said people need to choose to be happy & it's all about choices. She went on to say suicide is cowards way out & people have choices. She said fat people choose to be fat because they choose not to exercise & eat properly. I have battled depression & anxiety for 14 years & this time last year I was hospitalised. I am in a good place now but it wasn't a simple choice & if I had a setback she would refer to me as a fruit loop as she does other staff suffering mental health conditions. I was 30 kg overweight till this year but I didn't choose to be that way & if I could have fixed it overnight with a choice I would have. I have been in a good place but this has really bothered me. My colleague tried to explain ill mental health is not a choice but to no avail. I get there are ignorant people out there but was not expecting it was something from someone in her position. Mind you this is the same day we had an R U OK function with our staff today & had a BB Ambassador speak. My friend thinks I should report her but I have to report to this person. Truly gobsmacked!!

My sister tell me I have mania because I am so up and down, people tell you to get help but I feel sometimes thing just get on top of you. Everyone these days seems to busy to really want to do more than token help. I don't know if this is just me not being able to deal with situations. Is there somewhere you can just chat online and not have people judge or pretend to care.

Hi All
Decided to rant because I am so over this depression!
My first depression was over 23 years ago. I have been on an antidepressant ever since and never had another episode until May this year.
I was quick to pick up the signs and finally got into see a psychiatrist at the end of June. I was put back into the same combination of medication that got me well the first time. Wow some of the side effects I never had all those years ago, I definitely have this time!
I have an amazing partner who is both supportive and loving. He is my Tower of strength both episodes. This time around it's a bit harder having though having 2 teenage children. I haven't told the kids as they would take it very hard.
It has been 10 weeks or so since beginning medication. I am no longer low but still haven't returned to myself. I find this so hard to deal with. I find the everyday tasks a challenge, just thinking of what to have for dinner every night does my head in. I feel I am constantly counting the days, weeks,months that this has been going on. I get so upset that I'm not 100%. I feel like I am letting down my husband and kids. School holidays are coming up and I was unable to take the kids anywhere in the last holidays.
My husband says I'm too hard on myself but I am just so over it. How much longer does this suffering have to go on for before it's done?

Hi 
I recently joined the Army 7 months ago but for the past 5 years I've been suffering from depression however during those years I didn't know much about depression and thought that my internal struggles were normal. But things started to get worse and I did some researching and from the info I gathered from mental health websites such as Beyond Blue I was indeed suffering from depression. I sought help through the Army and went to see a Psychologist but the worst thing was I couldn't tell her everything. I only told her about 10 percent of what's really going on. It's like there was an invisible force preventing me from saying everything I just couldn't do it . I hate that at the most crucial moment to actually get help I was weak. How can I overcome this beast and actually tell my Psychologist the whole story.

Hi Everyone,
I've been battling with depression/anxiety on and off for 12 years. Luckily in the last 3 years, with the help of meds and occasional counselling I've been feeling a lot better and have been mostly on the up. However in the last month I've completely spiralled into darkness and self loathing.
I am lucky enough to have everything 'sorted'. 

Full time work
loving boyfriend
cute (if bitey) kitten
home (mortgage) owner
travel plans on the horizon

I thought that not having to worry about these things anymore would help me feel at peace. But instead I'm finding myself feeling the worst I've felt in two years. Just not being able to shake this feeling of complete sadness and failure. Previously I could pin it to something, though now, there's nothing  
In my recent appointment with my psych we spoke about acceptance and trying not to fight my depression. But I can't help but feel like it's not fair. That just because something in my body is broken, I have to go through this wave of overwhelming sadness. Just to accept this is my lot in life. Get up, got to work and push through  
How is that ok? What is the point in trying if this wave will just come and crush me again in a few years, months or weeks?
This really is making me question the point of living if this is to be the cycle.
I guess I'm just putting these thoughts out there to see if anyone else has had the same advice, or how you got to a point of acceptance. Because I'm really struggling here to see the positives.
Thank you for listening/reading.

My whole life has spun totally out of control. After battling, mostly alone, for more almost 40 years.  I think I've tried everything anyone could possibly suggest to try to help me.  Nothing has ever really helped.  Every single aspect of my life has been ruined because of this dreadful, ugly illness. I don't even know where to start.  I'm unemployed, single, no home of my own, no car, no money. Just on unemployment benefits and dragging myself through each day.  I have sisters and a brother who are busy with there own lives.  They love me and care about me but there's really nothing they can do.  I am tired, so very tired of fighting.  It's true, no one wants to hear about it.  I've lost all of my so called friends because of this.  What I hate most is there is nowhere to turn, so I suffer in silence my whole life.  This only makes it harder to cope.  If you asked me if I was suicidal, I would say no.   I don't want to die, but that's because I don't want my family to suffer.  Honestly, what I do want is to be sedated, so I'm still alive for them but I don't have to feel like this any more.  I try to sleep the day away, but one can only sleep for so long.  I feel like I'm out of options.

So I'm a 19 year old male who has recently finished working full time for around 5 months on a construction site. I know it may sound quite obvious that my depression has flared ever since my last day on the job due to the sudden change in environment and routine, but for the last few days, my depression has reached to a point I've never experinced before. It started as i was working, due to the isolation and such long hours, but it has gotten a lot worse ever since i no longer work in the industry. I'm unmotivated to do anything, sleep strange hours, feel a general sadness and extreme mood swings. I'll also add that i am on medication for an anxiety disorder (OCD), which may play a role. I'm scared that i will soon be diagnosed with clinical depression, considering the fact that I'm already on meds and i still have it tells me that my depression is non-curable. Any thoughts?

I have depression and have pills. The past few years I find myself getting angry a lot of the time. I just cannot cope with incompetence or mediocrity anymore. I have so much anger I try to deal with and it gets my blood pressure right up. I am already on high meds and I check it all the time. I exercise really hard each day and eat a reasonable diet. I seem to be ok until something goes wrong and then I get so frustrated. It can be simple things like people not paying attention in the traffic, or badly designed websites, store people getting my order mixed up. 
 
Any advice would be appreciated. I feel like I am going to explode.

I have been struggling with depression for about 18months now and it has gotten progressively worse. 
 about two years ago I moved away with my partner for work. It takes three flights just to get back to where our family and friends are from so as you can imagine we don't get home much. I had a baby about 10 months ago and with no family support it has been difficult. 
I told my GP how I have been feeling and about three months ago he put me on anti depressants. I haven't told any of my family or friends because I am embarrassed. I feel like I'm weak and why would anyone want to talk to me if I'm being such a downer so I always put on a happy fake phone self. Now it's to the point I am avoiding their calls. I don't want to call anyone. I don't do anything or go anywhere, I'm at home all day with a baby and it's an effort to get out of bed (I always attend to all his needs no matter how bad of a day I am having) but I find it hard to even want to do my hair or makeup, clean the house etc. but I also feel like by moving home I am ruining our future because we are here working away for a reason. 
 all as my partner ever says is it's my fault for not helping myself and I understand if I did things like mothers group and took the baby to the park etc. I would probably feel better but it just feels like such a big task to get myself organised enough to get out the door. Especially when I dread seeing anyone else. 
Can anyone else relate or am I just super crazy. 😢 
i don't feel like myself at all!! I don't feel normal. I don't feel like I will ever be happy again even if I do move home. Where as six months ago I thought moving home would be great as I would have support and friends and family now I can't see myself happy anywhere. Feel so lost! 
 P.s- partner works 13days straight and only has every second sunday off and he leaves for work at 5am and doesn't get home until 6pm or 7pm! I feel so alone.

I just feel like going for a long drive and forgetting about work the next day. Just piss off somewhere, lay down somewhere and just relax to forget about all the crap. I hate that it feels like I never have an outlet. I could post my woes on Facebook, but most of the people on my friends list don't care or don't understand. It's hard to try and get my point across to people. I think a lot of people think I'm acting angrily towards them for a personal reason but it really isn't. Just seems like people have just given up on me. Used to be a friendly individual, but things have changed. People are starting to resent me and it feels like I can't do anything to reverse that. Sometimes I try hard to be friendly towards people but it's never taken seriously. It's annoying because I try to so hard to treat other people with the same respect I expect, but barely get it. That's when I get annoyed and just think ""Screw everything"". I thought I was a relatively likable person, but it seems people are just staying clear of me for whatever reason. The only people that understand me truly are my parents and friends. All these issues are pointed towards work as well. I try so hard to please everybody and I get pissed off if something is hindering my ability to do a good job. Also just feels like no one truly cares about me and any sort of empathy towards me is either half assed or full of crap. People seem to think that I despise them, but it's only because I'm struggling with all these mental gymnastics going on. I hate it how people assume that you can cope with things perfectly without taking in consideration the crap you have to deal with in your head on a daily basis. Sometimes I wish people could read my mind and it would make my life so much easier. But at the same time, why does everyone seems to only care for themselves. Is that the way we are supposed to live? We're all in this together and I thought we all would try to make life a better experience for everybody. Everyone is truly self motivated and that pisses me off. I try my damn hardest to make people understand what I'm feeling but when I do, I get everything half assed with little emotion. Show me some damn respect like I've shown you. It feels like my superiors at work don't give a crap about me, even though I've put in blood, sweat and tears, while other employees get treated like royalty in comparison. I could go on forever, but any reply would be appreciated. Thank you.

I work as a kindy educator and have been under a lot of stress this year. I have a really challenging class who have lots of undiagnosed developmental concerns. The parents on the whole are needy, demanding and do my head in every day. I have told my managers so many times that the children and the parents are getting to me and they just say I should ignore it, not stress so much, not let it get to me etc. All the patronising cliches but no acknowledgement of what it's doing to me or offers to help in any real way. A week ago a group of parents began to criticise me publicly and described me as rude and unapproachable (this feels like the fallout of ""ignoring them"" as I was encouraged to do). My managers brought it up with me... they believe they were doing their job but it just felt like I'm being targeted by these parents and i don't know why they hate me so much.
This week I've tried to move on and forget about it, but it started within 30 minutes on Monday. Parents complaining, children having meltdowns, staff numbers being low and just feeling like I'm on a knifes edge. A colleague complained to my managers that I'm so stressed and negative that it's uncomfortable for others. Called in to the office again. They suggested I take a week off to ""have some me time"" and ""put myself first"". I was so upset I couldn't even respond to half of what they were saying. I felt like I was in trouble for not coping. All I want (as childishas it seems) is for someone to just have my back and feel like they're seeing how sad I am. Instead it was like being scolded for not being happy enough.
I've now had to explain to my partner that I'm off work and feel pathetic and useless. I love my job and care so much for these kids... but there is only so much I think I can take of being kicked when I'm down. I can't stop crying, I can't eat and I'm so exhausted I can hardly get up out of bed.
I now have ten days without work where I'm supposed to do things that make me happy so I can come back and just... be great I guess. I don't even know where to start when I can't stomach the thought of ever going back. I feel such shame, guilt and despair that i can't even cope being a freaking kindy teacher. It shouldn't be this hard. I know I shouldn't be this stressed. But with another class like this one already lined up for next year, I can't see the light.
How can i get past this?

Hi everyone,
I've had depression and anxiety for about a year now, and the past few months I just feel like everything is getting worse and it's harder to keep fighting it.
Initially it was just that I was having problems at uni... I failed a few subjects last year and was on the verge of being kicked out, however I wasn't because they took my mental illnesses and things happening at the time into account. I am however a year behind my friends now, and I just feel like the cohort I'm in now is so unfriendly compared to mine. We were all so close last year, but my new one is just so segregated and no one seems to really have friends. I'm currently waiting for my results from last semester, and I'm really anxious about it, because if I failed again, I'm definitely getting excluded and I would have no idea what to do if that happened. I need this degree for the field I want to go in to, and it's one of those degrees where if you get excluded from one uni, you're basically guaranteed to not be accepted elsewhere either. There's nothing else I want to do with my life though except this, so I'm just really worried at the moment. 
Apart from this, I spent the majority of last year having problems with my BF's family, and I've spent the majority of this year having problems with my own. And every time I feel like I'm making progress with my family, it's one step forward, three steps back. I've been lucky though that my BF has been my absolute rock. However now the problems between my family and I are affecting my relationship with him, and things are going downhill very fast, and now I'm worried that we're going to end. 
I don't have many friends, and the one or two I do have, have really busy lives so I feel like I don't have many people to talk to at all. I feel really alone a lot of the time now, and as the bad things keep piling on, I just get more tired of trying to fight it. It's kind of like I feel like I make some progress, but then something else happens, and it undoes the work I put into trying to fight this, and now it's just exhausting. I haven't ever had suicidal or self harm thoughts, but I do sometimes wonder what's the point of all this pain.

I'm struggling at work.
my relationship with my boss has got under my skin so much that whenever I have to spend prolonged time with her I want to go to the bathroom and cry as soon as it's over. 
I feel like I have so much to give and so many ideas but am shut down all the time. It's not like she's 'evil' she's just not in anyway interested in people, in developing them, challenging them, nurturing them in fact it's the opposite - we are cogs in a machine.
i know it's my fault and I should look for another job but my confidence and resilience has taken a beating. I moved house recently and am still feeling very unsettled and am struggling so don't feel I could take another big change 😟 Plus I probably couldn't find a job anyway.
I feel like I'm being miserable and unprofessional. But don't know how to approach the issue or snap out of it.

Hi everyone, 
 
This is my firdst post on here but thought it's the place to seek help and maybe get some feedback on my situation. At present I work in a technical job on the road and am able to work from home. I find myself isolated a fair bit which I feel affects my relationships with people. I have suffered from depression since I was 17 (now 40) which I find has affected my relationships, even through I wasn't aware of it. Alot fo the time I feel confused and exhausted from daily anxiety. Feels like I'm always over tired where I feel uptight regulary even though I consider myself to be laid back. I really enjoy sociallising but don't seem to fit the mould at work, which I really domn't know what sort of job I am aligned to. I feel zoned out alot and disconnected from the world. My mind runs around in circles most of the day where it feels like I'm having a continuous mid-life crisis. Some times I may ose contact with people for a month or so and don't even realise it. I have trouble reading people at work in an office environment where I feel I am a different person to who I really am. I've lost my father recently, and this has added extra stress, along with dealing withmy brother who is recovering from a drug addiction and mental health issues which has putmuch strain on the family and myself. My mind feels foggy alot where I used to drink almost daily but have reduced it to 1-2 times per week over the last month to cut back. I think I've used alcohol to self medicate but I dont want to do that anymore, I want to enjoy life as it is. Wondering if anyone has any advice? I'm currently single and live alone in my own house.

Hi Everyone
I'm new to the site, but not to depression. I had an episode over 20years ago and have been well since then until May this year. I can assure you I was totally amazed that I was once again heading into a darkness I never thought I would see again. This episode has been nowhere near as bad as my first one but debilitating to say the least. Different time in my life with 2 teenage children to worry about , and not letting on that I'm not 100%. I can't tell them.....they would be devastated. I am lucky enough to  still have the same loving and supportive man in my life that was there for the first episode. I have hated every minute of this episode and can't wait for it to be over. I have been counting down the days weeks and months! Finally I am into my 9th week of medication and I'm starting to lift. Fingers crossed this continues to be the case. To those that are struggling , be rest assured there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep pushing and trying everyday no matter how hard it is. Set just one goal everyday and achieve it. All those years ago when I became well after my depression, I felt grateful that I have suffered. It made me a better person, more compassionate , caring as well as patient.
May whatever demons you are fighting start to lift. May you see the Sun in the sunshine and may you be well.

Hi all,
I'm relatively new to these forums as a poster, so hello :). In short, the last few years have been trial after trial and I suppose I reached breaking point a few days ago. It was as though all the little coping mechanisms I had clung onto just slipped out of my fingers. I found myself breaking down on my drive home, yelling at my boyfriend over the phone through a stream of tears and snot. Not my most glamorous moment, for sure. 
Truth is, this can be a lonely and isolating disease. Some years ago, I fractured my ankle - it seemed the whole world was willing to help and be accommodating of my newfound disability. Depression/anxiety are infinitely worse but the support seems to become so much scarcer. No one wants to hear it and the advice is often patronising and dismissive. You feel like you are burdening people so you don't say anything - and when you do open up, you realise the ears you had hoped would be there turn away. 'I don't know what to do or how to help'. 
I'm here because...I just needed to be around people who get it, even if it's just virtual. The people in my life can relate to depression about as well as I can relate to Iron Man and sometimes being looked at like an alien isn't the best feeling.
As abnornal as this disease feels, I know it's also a 'normal' reaction when you feel like you're sinking, when problems and frustrations and obligations build up so much they make the Great Wall of China seem like a little child proof gate. The hard part is climbing out, especially when you feel like your legs have been cut off at the knees. 
I know there's always hope - some light at the end of the tunnel that isn't yet visible.

Lately ive noticed that my depression could be killing me.. With yummy foods.. And that is no joke.  Ive stacked on the weight since my family passed away. And i dont seem to care. Reaching for a packet of C'Cs or nervously pigging on a packet of bickies during a footy game is inevitable. I seem to treat it as normal. Am in the mid to high 90 kgs.  And dont fit into my favourite clothes. I have a huge double chin. And i constantly laugh at it. A doctor said... IT WILL KILL YOU... i said YEP.  And didnt stop my ways.  What can i do????  Its linked to my depression. Since my families death. . Cheers.. Wayno.

Hi there
im young but have suffered with depression for more than 10 years
right now I'm at a stand still were everything is happening and I'm just going along for the ride unwillingly.
i have desicions that need to be made, but I feel so lost, so useless and have no hope. 
I have amazing support from those around me, but it just doesn't seem to be enough anymore.
iv seen many councellors and psychologists over the years to the point that I inform the qualified and they don't have much to feed me. 
Im not saying there not good, I'm great full for their knowledge but I feel like it's now a broken recored. 
i feel iv exhausted my options on therapy. 
I know that many things factor into creating a good wellbeing I'm   Trying to balance this, but something's lacking

How do people cope? Its all too much and it seems to keep piling up. I dont know where to turn. I pretend to everyone it is much better than it is. I just dont tell them how I really am. I live with my daughter and son-in-law and 2 adult grandsons. My daughter is so good but has her own issues. I dont want to overburden her. My son-in-law doesnt like me talking or even mentioning my late husband..he passed 2 yrs ago...apparently it is too negative. He tells me to get OTC sleeping tablets as i hardly sleep. I take meds, see a doctor regularly and try and eat well. But the black hole I sit at the bottom of is winning...i feel like i want it to close over me. I cry sometimes for no reason. I have little interest in anything. I try to be happy. I try to find positives. I worry. I can't shut down amd relax then i worry more and panic sets in. I feel like I am loosing control and my depression ramps up. 
Have you felt this way? What do you do?
I just really want to feel a sense of normality..whatever that is. I want to feel useful but the way I am now I hardly function let alone feel as if I am contributing to life.
I just feel lost lonely unloved useless worthless...the list could go on
My depression is winning and I feel like I have no way to fight back.
I guess I dread where my life is going. I can see where it could end up and I hate that thought.
any ideas? Any suggestions?
Thank you

I've been depressed for a long time. I've been medicated for a about 5 years. I have recently started re-seeking help (seeing someone, changing my meds) but i'm having a really hard time. I feel like nothing good ever happen to me and everything that's about to falls through. I talk to my friends about it but they just say that I need to be proactive and good things will happen for me but I am. I feel like they think i'm lazy and i'm not trying to be better because they don't always see the things i'm doing (this for example). I often feel very lonely but I also struggle to leave the house sometimes so they use that as ""why didn't you come to this?"". It's so hard to explain to them that I want/need to see them but sometimes I can't face and that it doesn't make sense to me either. Then I just become more depressed because of what I feel they think of me.

Hi there,
My name is Jamie. I've been dealing with a depression that has gone on for nearly 2 years. I have had short bouts of depression prior to this but have always come out the other side after a month or so. This bout of depression has really put me through the ringer. I am self employed and my work involves me utilising digital media on projects often related to community and education sectors. Prior to becoming depressed I was an energetic, creative, motivated, passionate person who had lots of interests. These are fairly essential qualities for the work I do. It is like the parts of my brain that house these characteristics and abilities has gone to sleep, or worse disappeared. I struggle in meetings where I am called on to think creatively and be enthusiastic. Once upon a time this kind of stuff would come so naturally and now its just not there. My fear is I wont get it back. I'm really trying to get myself well again with the help of psychologist, psychiatrist, support groups and family etc. I just cant seem to get that 'magic' back that was the core of who I once was. I don't know if anybody on here has had a similar experience? I'm thinking I may have to look at changing careers to something less creative which breaks my heart but I am part of a family and we cant just survive on my wife' income. Needless to say the business is nothing like it was prior to a couple of years ago as I just haven't had the energy or motivation to market myself and chase work. I am doing my best to keep the anxiety I have about the work I do have in check. I don't really want to do any of it but have to for the money it brings. Anyway maybe someone will read this any be able to relate, even offer some suggestions.
Jamie

I suffer from Depressions and Anxiety. After 2 years I can feel happy and ok only to struggle with little things which can really upset me. It is when I loose control over the issue. I can get sad first, then really angry and feel even rage. It can take me sometimes up to 3 days to recover from such event. Does anyone have tips how I can try to mitigate this issue? It does really take a toll from me and I want to handle it better.
Maybe if I can let go quicker it may help?
Thank you for any tips.

Hey Everyone,
 
I need some advice, and because I don't really have anyone else to talk to about it, I have turned to you.
 
Since being diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression about 3 years ago I was started on medication. Worked well for awhile, but my chemistry adjusted and felt as though nothing worked.
So my dose was doubled. Which was great, but still affected my work performance. After much discussion with both my Dr and Phsycologist it was determined that I may not actually have Depression and I was recently moved from my medication.
In itself, this was great, I now know what is wrong as Depression and ADD have very similar symptoms. Thus where this story is now leading to....
I haven't found a good way to approach my boss and inform him about what's going on, sadly anxiety rears its head I clam up and decide I'd rather not have the stigma attached to me in a professional environment. Now that I have not been issued and form of anti-depressant, I'm having a hard time adjusting.
It started on Saturday and continues today, the withdrawal symptoms. It's not fun. Head spins, little to no balance, headaches, pulsing electrical 'Zaps' from my ears to my toes.
Its not safe to drive and as that is a large part of my job, in the name of being safe, took today off. Only to be greeted by an upset boss. I get that he doesn't understand what's going on because I haven't told him... But how the hell do you approach this subject with someone like that?
Its not easy even thinking about it, because I know that as soon as I tell him, EVERYONE else in the office will know by the end of the day. Which is not something I desire greatly.
 
Does anyone have any advice?
 
Cheers.

I don't really know how to explain anything. I'm lost and confused and a million different things but i just feel so lost. I am becoming disassociated with things and people. I've had a falling out with one of my close friends and another one has no interest in me anymore. I've spent weeks crying and being an emotional wreck however this past week i just feel nothing. I feel nothing when i do daily things or am with family or friends. I've been struggling for close to ten years now and i don't know why. I don't know what to do. I have to see a psychologist but at the present time i can barely get out of bed. My friend used to blame themselves but now when they say anything they say things similar to ""oh but it shouldn't matter because you don't feel anything"" which is true. Statements like that previously would've hurt me but i have nothing. I feel like everything's irrelevant and i'm falling back into old habits. I just don't know how to go about feeling anything. I can barely speak, i go nights and days without physically saying anything and no one notices. I can't cry. I can't taste anything when i do eat which is rarely at the moment. I'm just lost and i don't know what to do.

Hi, this is my first post. I have been diagnosed with melancholic depression but have been experiencing the symptoms for many years prior. I am on an antidepressant but am struggling all the same. Due to the characteristics of melancholic depression I.e. Avoiding contact, immense guilt and lying to the people I love, I have not seen a psychologist for >2 months and have been drinking to avoid feeling the guilt. I am in danger of being unemployed as I have been avoiding work (calling in sick too many times). All of this seem to be an endless cycle with no way out. I know that I need to take the step to go and see my G.P. and the psychologist but instead I stay  at home stewing in my guilt. I work the the healthcare profession but I feel lost as I do not understand why I am feeling like this. I have a loving husband and a loving family so I have no reason to feel like this. It seems to add to me feeling lost and like I'm spiralling into a hole...

Hi, 
 
Well I've been off work, for reasons that relate to work place issues I've been going through, I lodged a workers comp claim, and today I realised I could not cope with the enormity of what was about to take place, I had a massive melt down and I put a stop to the claim for now. I feel relieved somewhat, but I've a long road ahead, it just seemed all way to much for me atm. I need to concentrate solely on my mental health as my primary objective, anyone else had to make decisions like these, I would love you're support on this. 
 
Regards

Hi guys ,
I been struggling with depression / anxiety for a while and in the last 8 months I have left my wife which has decreased my stress a lot but recently I have met someone new that gave me support and just a real boost in happiness .
I feel recently that the honeymoon period is over and I'm seeing some unusual traits , I'm in the best shape myself but some things worry me.
my girlfriend has these moments where she will find something difficult to deal with and she shuts down , more accurately she puts her head down for long periods of times and ignores anything around her and when you speak to her it's a mumble like when someone is drunk and just vomited and doesn't want to speak , I find this very unusual .
I want to support her where I can and I wait it out and talk to her about what happens but I feel the talks aren't helping much.
she does everything the hard way , she almost complains about everything around her except me but I am seeing that it could be rolling over me now from a couple of comments she has made .
her kids don't listen to her and don't clean up anything after themselves , the house is always messy, I feel she is struggling everyday and I try to help her with chores 
I want to help her but I think there is some issues here with her and I'm not sure if she needs to talk to someone.
her mother which suffered mental health problems passed away about 2 years ago and is still struggling with it , 
I'm not sure if her issues are hereditary but she also has hormone issues .
i really don't know how to deal with this , I want to help her but I get the feeling she needs some help .

I struggle getting out of bed everyday. I hear the kids awake, often crying in their rooms having been awake for some time. I feel like a failure. A terrible mother. A pathetic and worthless human. I always plan to get up early and do workouts before the kids wake up but that only happens about once a week. I know I am fully capable to do the things I want to do but it is so hard to bring myself to do them. 
My oldest is two and second 9 months. I find myself wishing I didnt have to be a mum anymore more times than I like to admit. I love my kids to pieces ofcourse but I never realised it would be so hard. My hubby will play with the kids but doesn't help out often. 
I feel like I have no purpose. I don't contribute anything. I wish I could put the kids in daycare and work but that isn't an option for another 6 months at least. 
I hate talking face to face about how I feel. Husband thinks it's just something I can get over if I want to. Sometimes there only seems to be 2 options. End it or leave and be a single mum. It's so hard to love when emotions don't come easy. I'm lost and don't know where to go. Any advice?

My voices are more distressing when I m alone or when I m depressed . They call me lots of things that I cant mention mainly swearing and they call me weird when I m not I m not weird . I get lonely all the time my parents brought me a parrot but that has not helped I still get lonely I have no friends and if I want to make friends on E harmony or RSVP I don't have a credit card so I get more depressed if RSVP was a better website I would find friends but I will keep trying even if it hurts . I m 24 years old and no guy wants me at all the more I cry and the more sad I get is annoying looks like I got schizophrenia and bipolar 1 . I wish me mom and dad could move but we probably cant anyway thanks to these voices . Can or does anyone want to be my friend if not then that's okay I get use to it

Hi,
I am currently having a major depressive episode at the moment that flared up following the 5th anniversary of my late grandad's death (23/08/2012).   I was very close to Grandad and losing him has turned my mental health upside down.  I am finding it hard to not cry but haven't really stopped since yesterday (23/08/2017).  In consultation with my GP, I have increased my medication but it hasn't taken effect yet.  Work is very understanding, they have said they want me to concentrate on my health before returning to work. But being casual, I only get paid for hours worked.
Trying to be stronger but finding it very hard.
How do others handle work with depression??   
Thank you for any helpful tips/guidance.

Hi Everyone,
I have been meaning to post here again, but I felt like I was bothering people when I did. I feel like I needed to post again because I need to talk/write more.  The past year has not been so good for me because I hate living where I am, I am getting mixed results studying at university and it feels like I am slowly losing my trust and faith in people again.  I will openly admit that some issues I have put on myself because I have been going to strip clubs and my only physical contact with women has been with sex workers. This is because I am starting believe the only positive interactions I will have with women is if I pay them! I hate where I am living because are neighbor's son in law coward punched and assaulted my dad whilst he was on the ground! The neighbour's son in law also abuses his children and it's hard listening to that almost every single day! My neighbor claims he has it under control, but he doesn't. I want to stay at uni, but I am starting to feel isolated and having doubts if I can pass. I am worried that I will fail and get kicked out! It is also stressful because I am also on centrelink payments, so if I get kicked out I lose payments which is only my only source of income at the moment. It feels like I am standing in quicksand! I guess I am just asking to be heard and if anyone else can relate? 
Regards,
AGentleSoul

ive been doing pretty well since february when i came here in a very bad way. things have been more stable and more positive. but a mistake i made at work, not a very big one, but still .. and a phone call from the boss about the mistake, have knocked me off course again. im disappointed by how such a little thing can make me feel so low and hopeless. like things will never change for the better really. the most i can hope for is to get through the days somehow and keep finding something to pull me into tomorrow. so. at a time i had imagined id be getting stronger and more engaged in the world, here i am back in bed feeling like im made out of lead and the world outside my bedroom is hard and frightening and not made for me. bummer.

Hello guys.
This is my first post here, and I'm unsure how exactly to say it, so here goes:
Today is probably the most down I've felt before. I'm tired and I'm struggling to find happiness ahead. I've struggled with sleep and the ability to find joy since I started back at uni 4-5 weeks ago. I'm a full time student and have been since I started. It's not that I don't like my degree, it's just I struggle to motivate myself. I suffered days in year 12 with a lack of motivation, but it would clear up after a day or two. This year however, I often have thoughts as to why I'm doing what I'm doing or what the point of doing uni or anything is. I find it hard to talk about this with my family, as my dad seems overly confident and hard to talk to, and I don't know how mu mum would react.
This morning was particularly unusual for me. I woke up perfectly fine this morning (first time in weeks), but after I left home for uni, I started feeling flustered and questioning myself. I was trying not to break down on the way to the city. I just don't know why.
I created this account this morning because I needed to vent out my issues anonymously. I don't know what to do. I looked online, but I feel it is over generic and not very helpful (even though it could be). I feel like I need to have a break and do something fresh, but that was the half the point for entering uni. I figured the longer travel times and the fresh air would be good, but nowadays it's just a long walk.
What do I do? I've never had any thoughts of self harm, let alone suicide, but I need a plan to improve my quality of life.
Thank-you for any help that you guys provide.

I'm completely at a loss, I'm suffer with anxiety and depression I also have BPD. 
Ive been struggling with a drug addiction for 5 years. In that time I have lost the love of my life been subject to serious emotional and physical abuse from a ex who is in a drug psychosis. I can't hold down jobs, relationships & holding on to my remaining friendships by there last thread.  I'm emotionally disconnected and numb, my once bubbly nature has become withdrawn and I find it hard to communicate & be in public settings.
And I just don't see it getting better.
i spend every day in bed, I think I'm okay until I break down. Most days I think I just live in complete denial. 
I have lost my License, my house, really have no sense of self or identity and never have. I know drugs are a problem but if I didn't have them to numb me at times I don't know if I would still be here. and a lot of these issues sound like easy fix problems but they aren't I've tried. I feel as if im broken, I've studied all different things worked all different jobs I get so depressed I either get fired or leave.
im so ineed of a reason to get out of bed and a income I got in to prostitution. some days I think I do it because I like it other days I'm sure I hate it and I think I only got it to it to punish my self.
i have no idea about anything in my life I feel as if none of it's real and I'm on the verge of a psychotic breakdown. I don't know how my life from a normal happy child could turn in to this nightmare that won't end it's seems so unreal im honestly not sure if my life happening or this is in my head. I'm my own worst enemy, I'm on medication, seeing a psychiatrist and getting drug and alcohol counciling. nothing is helping and at the end of each appointment I smile and make out as if I'm okay. I'm incapable of letting my self realise how desperate, hopeless & completely misserable I am.
and each time I actually realise how I feel, I get pushed closer & closer to the edge of breaking beyond repair. Surly at some point I will give up because it's allready at a unbearable point. but in amongst that I'm so confused and lost, I don't know what's wrong with me  if anything or if maybe these are just excuses & I'm just lazy and self pitying and self loathing. I want to disappear but how do I hide from myself.
pls anything I have never opened up like this before but I have no where else to turn 😔

Hi
i have dealt with depression for 20+ years now. I have self esteem issues and don't believe that people want to be with me. As a result I lock myself away and avoid social engagements. As a result of that I feel desperately lonely and as though I'm on a self perpetuating cycle. 
Does anyone have tips on any outlets? How do you strike up contact with people without having the pressure of socialisation?
Thanks in advance

I am 65 years old, have a partner, we are both on the pension, we have a mortgage which takes almost one pension payment each month, we struggle with everyday living, live in an older house, with no real heating, a wood fire which we cannot afford to buy wood for, an old AC/heater in the wall - expensive to run - we are in a rural area, nearest actual shopping centre is 26 km's from us and is almost useless.  I feel so trapped, the house is old and very cold, high ceilings and mornings can be around 5° inside, I now stay in bed where I am warm but this means I am bored,lonely and frustrated. Cannot afford to go anywhere as money is not there, we have no savings, neither of us had Super, my partner was injured 20 years ago and has not worked since.  Cannot move as the selling price once debts removed would not cover anything at all and the banks just laugh at us so we are stuck, cannot afford to improve things here and cannot afford to move.  I know that no one can give me a solution I just need to vent and talk . .

I'm looking for shared experiences from other ppl living with bipolar (one or two)-
Most of the time I look for signs my mood is sinking, and I think I'm getting pretty good at managing it before I get really depressed. Then sometimes I feel I'm in a weird space and I wonder if this is the precursor to a coming high. 
Im on mood stabilising medication so haven't reached a full-blown mania episode but I sometimes these mild ""highs"" do make me feel impulsive and risky.  I want to go out dancing and drinking with friends. I get more energy to do things around the house. My sleep changes a little but not in the way I've experienced in hypomania.
C anyone share what it feels like for them before mania or is it just a ""normal"" strange mood? I feel like I don't want to worry my family or doctors unnecessarily. I also don't want to need to increase my meds unless I really have to.

Hi everyone, 
so for the past year or more I haven't been myself... went to the doctor and got a referral for the psychologist and his diagnosis (and the doctors) is bipolar. 
I am booked in for a psychiatrist appointment for a second opinion and am waiting on that.... 
the problem is I told my partner and he just said to me - great... another problem we don't need. We can't catch a break. He told me he doesn't believe any of the people I have seen and I don't think he will believe anyone. 
i don't know what to do. I have no support and I am all alone. Since I found out I was kind of realived... I was happy to know that it was okay for my mind to be this way and there are ways of managing it but he thinks I am fine. 
I hide behind a facade that takes all my might until I snap... it takes all my energy and I am just so exhausted. 
I am a mother I do everything for everyone else... but I guess this is just an inconvenience

I just joined today. Maybe filling this blank box will be therapeutic in itself.
I have a decent enough full time job but only just it feels.  I work for good guys that understand my depression as much as you can as employers. But im home again cant do it, cant face people. I feel useless and guilty every time i miss work. Im sure my work mates get frustrated to see ""oh he is sick again."" 
I watched Chester Benningtons last interview and cried for a long time. I cried because it felt like he spoke from my soul too.
Im getting married soon to an amazing lady, im lucky enough to some times travel the world. My family and friends are supportive. I have a lot to be grateful for.
I know im not well though. I resent these things and people because they force me to stay.  I feel ungrateful guilty and obligated to live a ""happy"" life. 
But today like many others i just cant paint the smile on.

Hi,
i am 37 years old and have been through the ringer a fair few times.  I feel like no matter what i do, i can never get out of this rutt i am in.
Went to see the GP, using the K10 it worked out i was in a high range so he prescribed me medication to tackle the depression. I started taking the tablets and found my crying for no reason had stopped for a while, then even whilst i was on the tablets i started to again so i took myself off the tablets.  Now i am back to crying for no reason, even seeing a commercial on the T.V. with sad music makes me tear up.  
My GP recommended me a Physc, had one session and then she went on leave for a month, i haven't booked another appointment with her yet. didn't really gel with her to be honest.   Not sure if i can just get my GP to give me a referral to another physc.  
I work very long hours to keep myself busy. I seem to fly off the handle quite easily with my partner and then minutes later i am back to normal.  Im not sure if my GP is taking this very seriously. he seems to just want to write a script for medication and pass me to a physc.  My appointments with him never last more than 10min.  I have read posts here, on how people have spent a while taking to their GP so makes me wonder about my GP as well.
my life so far has been a struggle from a very young age and still continue to struggle.  I dont really know how to talk to my partner without worrying him.  So thats why i am on here, where no-one knows me and my family and hopefully wont judge me.
I feel like i am alone in this world.  Even though i have a great partner, great father and my work is going very well with a successful career.  Still feel like i am alone.  I sometimes cry myself to sleep. (even writing this post, i am welling up). I worry alot and avoid groups of people.

i'm a man, plumb straight, by self control, i'm able to defy detection by the closet observer, my depression.
but underneath the delicacy is still there, the tiredness and agitation by over-work in the paddock of capital and to make good pastimes.
i have a house over-looking the sea, my partner has a new car, away from all this i live in my car, charitable institutions feed me,
my strategies can fail but not in a complete heap of ash,

It's 5am and my mind is still very active. Times like these I'm bombarded with a myriad of feelings and thoughts. Mostly of worry/fear, deep regret and painful memories.
I've been diagnosed with depression/anxiety and mood disorder; and have been receiving treatment and medication for almost a decade now. The symptoms may have been around since i was in high school. I am now entering my 40s and I am disturbed by the fact that i have lost so many years to depression and solitude. I am still hopeful that things would turn out fine but i am afraid that time is running out for me to live life to the fullest.
It all started in school, i was badly bullied, mostly emotional (i would rather have been beaten up than called names). I was publicly humiliated on many occassions. The most traumatic was during my highschool graduation where they sang a corrupted version of the garduation song to humiliate me. What should've been one of the happiest moments in my life turned out to be a nightmare that would haunt me for years.
I was fed up. I swore to myself that i would never be in that situation again. I changed my persona to one that was a complete contrast of my former self. One day, my worst bully came up to me and bitch slapped me with a newspaper in front of a crowd. By then I had developed a fairly good reputation that i felt i had to keep, so with the little dignity i had, i was able to muster the courage to fight back. So i got up and punched the guy in the face. He was petrified, he retaliated with nothing but words and walked away. After what happened we became friends and i became one of 'them'.
Part of me had died the day i punched the bully. I began to lived a life of pretence, i was conceited, arrogant, extroverted yet introverted. Behind the facade was i was shy and insecure. I developed trust issues and attitude problems. I started losing friends and began to have difficulty any form of work. I dumbed down, barely passed college and always had difficulty in my job.
After so many years of sad and traumatic experiences, I became an escapist. I kept mostly to myself, playing video games, surfing the net, playing the guitar, and procrastinating. With each passing day i still hope that someday i would discover my true self and become happy and successful. I pray that it happens soon as i fear that i am getting old. My shyness and lack of skills has made it difficult if not impossible to get me out of my predicament It seems like only a miracle can help me.

Hi all, Raine here. 

Have been struggling with my mental health for many years, and only have started seeking help mid way through last year for anxiety. I have informally been diagnosed with GAD and mild social anxiety however lately I feel like I am depressed also. 
I'm in my second year at Uni studying Speech Pathology, living 6 hours away from my family and 7 hours from my boyfriend. I have quite a few friends where I am, and am living with 4 lovely people who I get along well with. 
I just feel so lonely and isolated from everyone and everything. I find myself not wanting to get out of bed, not wanting to talk to people. My appetite is very small and very unhealthy. I am finding that I am less interested in things I usually would be excited or happy about. I have also recently stopped seeing my psych as I didn't like her, but had only been to 3 sessions. So I should probably be looking for a new one.
I have a good relationship with my family, however they just don't quite understand, though they do try their best to support me. My boyfriend is wonderful, he puts up with my crying over the phone almost every time I talk to him and deals with my mood swings constantly. I feel so bad that I am always getting annoyed with him over the littlest things, but it's never anything I should be cranky about. 
I just don't know what to do. I'm so sick of crying all the time, I find myself getting angry over the smallest things and I just can't keep control of my mental health, my mood or my life.
Any advice would be greatly helpful.

Hi all, 
Recently started on antidepressants for the first time ever and my parents are acting weird about them. Saying things like it being a 'short term thing' and suggesting ways to improve my mood without them. I think they're being like this because they don't quite understand. 
So, to all of you, I was wondering if anyone had any form of resources or articles I can show them to help them understand any part of depression, anxiety and taking antidepressants. Any help at all would be wonderful, I just want to feel supported by my family, and I don't think that will happen until they start to understand. 
 
Many thanks,
~ Raine

Hi guys, has been some time since my last post in 2015 (!!!) ... I've kind of found myself in a 360 mode where I have returned to the head space of not knowing what to do with my life. In the last 2 years I have built a wonderful personal life, and sadly recently fallen out with some very close family members of which I was at the end of incredible betrayal (over my recent wedding a couple of months ago), but have tried to turn this into ammunition to be a better person and do better with my life.
Currently I am working casually, really enjoying it but there's not a lot of hours to go around. I knew this when I signed up. I just wanted a physical job with less stress so I could ""try figure out my life"". Prior to this recent job, I worked in a full-time role for 3.5 weeks which I did not like at all, and felt very uncomfortable in, however now I am left with not earning enough to pay my bills, putting stress on my husband and myself because I simply cannot get my act together.
I want to work, I just don't feel like I have it in me to give a company my 'all', and lets face it, starting up some sort of study is going to keep me from earning money - I have thought about this option in great detail, but I have studied about 4 times before and always dropped out... I am really starting to resent myself and wish I knew where to turn, where to go.
I'm unfortunately claiming bankruptcy in a couple of months, which I have emotionally come to terms with. I'm now looking forward to it, to eliminate the background stress in my life...
I suppose all I can really put my thoughts and feelings down to is I'm annoyed I can't ""hold down a job"" or figure out what I want to do. I simply do not feel like I have the energy to work a full time job as stupid as that sounds, and staying in this casual role that I'm in now is not going to get me anywhere. I know it is a simple solution of applying and getting into something else, but what does someone do when nothing sounds good, nothing interests me and for a lack of a better term I cannot be bothered working at all.
I have NEVER been like this in my life. I am so strong and independent, and have had many many jobs in my time. But for some reason, its fallen on me like a tonne of bricks and if I don't do something shortly I will go down with them.

Hi, I am xprince, a guy who's fighting with his own demon of deep depression hidden and carried on for years till this date. Lately things are resurfacing and I am worried I can't suppress my depression any longer. I get frequent headache and really feeling weak overall of my body motivation. Am trying to fight it off and I am trying hard to function as normal as I could in everyday activities,  but my deep emotions or memory of what's happen to me in past or recent times, is profoundly impacting on my brain.. Hence these on and off headache I am getting. At this moment I can coupé but it's really pulling me down..  I have told know one of my condition till this day,  I can't easily just voice this type of matter to just anyone I personally know.. But my aspiration to live on to every morning or day,  seems less excited. I feel I've become completely irrelevant to my being on this earth. But my deep desire wants to live on and contribute in a positive way on this earth.. But I feel like am constantly a failure in all my endeavors and I tend to just leave everyone I once knew. Leaving me alone to just discuss my matter on this web page or online because I truly don't have the answer to what? Or how? To deal with what am going through now... I feel I am dying out in silence and I feel the worse may come to be,  if my unhappiness continues on..  I seek and welcome those whom are more well verse or professional in treating or advising me on my issues to help give me some indication to what I should do next please. I feel lost  and deep sadness arises time to time for which am trying hard to suppress it down.. I get headaches and weak body at times which this is the hardest to avoid or struggle with. Any advise I truly appreciate it.

Hi
Im just writing to calm me down as today Im really worked up and really battling with my depression, it started the minute I woke up my moods very black and nothing I seem to do works, Ive tried mindfulness not working, the only relief I seem to get is writing in my journal which Ive done alot of today. Im unsettled, restless and frustrated, Im now doing controlled breathing exercises, and I just know that Ive got a bad night ahead of me, not sleeping it looks like a night of foxtel sitting in my favourite chair. All I can hope for is tomorrow will be a better day.
Thank you for letting me vent

Hi everyone,
I'm 31 and having a very hard time coping at the moment so i thought i'd ask for advice here. My girlfriend of more than 4 years broke up with me yesterday and i know it's essentially because of my increasing depression, anxiety and social anxiety that seems to be getting worse, despite my efforts. I can't stop crying and i'm heartbroken and feel like it's my fault, she wants to move overseas and travel around the world and wanted me to go along, but the thought of being in that situation with no stability of family, friends, or work terrified me and though i desperately wanted to be the kind of person who could just 'do it' i know i would not be good in those situations and couldn't take the leap. She saw this as me not thinking she was worth it, even though that couldn't be more untrue. So i feel like i've driven a wonderful person that i love away because of my weakness and this in turn has made me feel even more depressed and alone than ever before.
I've tried to explain that i can't do certain things because of my issues, but it's been interpreted as a lack of commitment to the relationship, which isn't true in the slightest. On top of the depression, I have a lot of trouble in group social situations  and i get very stressed out at family gatherings and parties and people think i'm anti-social, but i'm just very anxious and feel the need to escape those situations. All this adds up to not being able to function as a normal person would in social situations that are important to a relationship. Then if i'm having a particularly bad day with my depression, i can't handle anything at all and avoid seeing people to not let them know what state i'm in. 
I'm lost for any way to get around this web of symptoms that seem to exist to attack everything that would make people want to be around me, or for me to have a better life. I've tried therapy twice, but found their approaches simple at best, for what feels like something that is immensely complex and being given the 'depression kit' of documents from a therapist seems like fighting the tide with a broom. I can't sleep, or find motivation, or connect with anyone i don't already know and i'm just foreseeing a future of never getting close to anyone, or worse, getting close and having them leaving me as soon as i have a bad day, week or month of depression, or can't fulfil social obligations. I feel like i've unintentionally sabotaged the best thing in my life and am immensely sad and lost.

Due to my chronic anxiety I have been unable to live a normal life which in turn has caused depression, anyway lately my depression has intensified and I'm always comparing myself to other people my age (24) and looking at what they're doing with their lives- working, studying at university, have friends, fit and healthy, independent and happy. I then look at myself and see this lazy, stupid, uneducated fat slob who sits around all day thinking crap and does time wasting things. I feel like I've wasted the past 7 years of doing nothing, even though I have done a couple of TAFE courses I feel as though that it's not good enough and I'm still dumb. I've explained this to my psychologist and he basically said ""they're just thoughts"" plus my family constantly says that I'm smart and intelligent but I think they just say that to make me feel better. I'm going to be 25 early next year and I can't work, I'm certainly not independent, I have no friends and I'm overweight and unfit. There are people out there that are far worse off health wise than me and yet they still manage to study and work etc.. Honestly I feel as though my life is just one complete messy waste and it's never going to improve. I don't know if any of these thoughts and feelings are due to depression or if it's because it's all true.

It's hard to know where to begin. I'm just sick of being sick/it's a never ending cycle. 
The last few years I have had pnuemonia, cancer, deviated septum surgery, constant colds and flus, insulin resistance, migraines, ulcerative colitis... The list goes on and on. I can't remember the last time I was okay! I have tried so hard to combat this with regular exercise when I'm not bed bound And eating ridiculously healthy but it doesn't seem to work and I'm continually putting on weight. 
I had to quit my job because I was told, how can you look after sick people if you are so sick all the time, you should stop working in X profession because you are shit at being healthy and are letting the team down. I was bullied Everytime I showed up to work with a medical certificate and accused of ""faking it"" 
As well as this I have lost multiple friendships over me being sick and friends telling me that I haven't put the effort in, despite when they have been sick in the past I've been the first person there to help. 
To add to this, I have recently been told I won't be able to conceive children because of my array of health problems and recent diagnosis of PCOS. This really is affecting my relationship with my husband as he is the first born child and only one to pass on the family name and I've basically screwed our chances of having children just because of being me. We both agreed we wanted kids and he has always said that if this changes it would be a deal breaker (back when we were dating)
I honestly feel useless. I can't go back to work because I'm too sick. Too sick to conceive a child. Been exercising and eating healthy yet can't shed any weight off. 
The last time I was severely depressed I was a young teen at home, being physically, emotionally and financially abused by my parents at home and socially isolated from all my friends, but I had my grandparents to help me out. This time though, they have been gone for quite sometime, I have no friends and I feel like if I tell my husband im slipping back into bed depression we will have no marriage/relationship either. 
On top of this, the unit we rent is being sold and we are being asked to move. It's been difficult to find anywhere to live as we have a pet and so far all of my applications to new places have been rejected. 
I have previously tried Lexapro consistently for a year with no luck. I have been to four psychogists with no break through. I exercise. I eat healthy. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Hi I'm brand new and dont know where to start. I had an excellent career as an intelligence officer with the AFP. I decided to leave that and move on to bigger and better things (or so I thought). my wife and I bought a franchise and they pretty much screwed us over. We lost over 160k in 12 months. It was like a kick in the guts to me. since moving to a coastal area its really hard to find work and has been for the past 6 years. I have had 3 month contracts with gov and even doing traffic control. I def feel like I have wasted a smart brain which makes me feel like a failure to me and my family. every time i try and do the right thing things just dont work out. my wife and my 2 boys (2.5 and 6 months) keep me going and remind me of the fun things in life. I have always worked to my full potential in the workforce only to get screwed over by others. I stand up to the bullies and get punished for it which makes me so irate. I feel down a lot and tend to break down sometimes. my mother passed away last dec and one of my sisters may not see xmas which is a lot to take inn. sometimes i just feel like packing up and just going, getting away from everything and find a place that I have no worries about. I tend to worry about everything and anything. I tend to create jobs for myself at home to try and forget about all the bad stuff, but then i just get overwhelmed with everything i am trying to do. I have so much more to say but its hard to talk about. I am def in a rut of not being happy. I hide it very well, but my wife can see it a mile away. ok thats all for now. im not a huge fan of bothering anyone else with my issues that are so much smaller than so many others out there.

Hi!
I've been researching a lot of symptoms and feelings I've been having. A lot of it seems to point in the direction of high functioning depression/anxiety. By all means, I am not self-diagnosing at all. Just wanting to find answers on how to improve my quality of life. I feel like GPs I've seen in the past haven't really been able to help in the mental health department as much -- maybe that's not their primary focus. I just want to know how I should approach a GP with getting a referral to someone who can really help me.
My life is manageable, I get by. But, I'm not sure if I'm really happy a lot of time and just kinda going with the flow, keeping things together.

I’m very alone, and am having trouble coping with this. I’ve
joined lots of organisations to try to make friends, and for three years I succeeded
in pretending that I was cheerful and friendly and helpful (and people have
complimented me on how cheerful etc I am); but only a few people have wanted to
be friends with me, and most of those have walked out of my life anyway. I’ve had more
rejections than I can handle, I’m more depressed than ever, I’m not able to
pretend any more, so I expect I would scare off anyone new.
I have run out of psychology visits for this year, but I
wouldn’t have needed so many if I had people in my life to have regular conversations with.  There are 3-4 nice people I can talk to maybe once a month, when they have time, but they are all busy with work and family most of the time, I'm a much lower priority.  
It seems that the more you need friends, the harder it is to find any.

So anyway since my first day at primary school to the end of high school. I have always been picked on having trash thrown at me, gang up on in groups of 5 or me bashed then left me laying there called me loser , creepy, dumb , worthless and poor because im ugly and due to that i have been isolated most of my life no body wants to be friends with the ugly kid. my family life isn't much better either my mum is a abusive alcoholic i have no dad and during school basically was living on and off the streets which was really hard to get good grades because as soon i was 15 i got a part time job so i could help pay mums rent, hotel, food or education school fees but most of my money i gave to my mum went to alcohol anyway. When i was 18 i moved into a share house because i couldn't stand my mum anymore i started a apprenticeship and recently finish im 23 now. i always thought it would get better when i got a roof over my head, car and a good income but i still find myself isolated and really struggling my thoughts lately. But i find it hard to reach out because i have anxiety lately i feel like there is someone in my mind always giving me negative thoughts making me feel down, worthless etc... like im a failure, your worthless,  nothing is ever good is going to happen to you.  i don't think help will work but has anyone out here had a similar story and had a positive outcome.

I have been treated for clinical depression and on medication for over a year now after a major breakdown while working full time. I have been stable and doing well since. I started a Masters of Social Work this year and did excellent going to class, participating in life in general and got great marks. My psychiatrist felt I was doing well and felt that I would do well coping with my placement. This semester  I need to do 15 weeks (4 days per week X 8 hour days) on prac + a day at university doing a required course. I got a great prac at a hospital with an amazing supervisor in the area I want to study. The problem is by the end of the day I spend the drive home crying and feeling awful after a great day at work. For the first two days of placement I went to the bathroom throughout the day and cried but I think I was working through nerves and anxiety. I spoke with my supervisor and we arranged a daily to day list so I was always aware of what I needed to do that day and could take it slow as I am only a 1st year student. This worked wonders and I didn't have any more anxiety at work after this. I've tried pacing myself at home and not really doing much to conserve my energy and I have no negative feelings about the prac but even doing simple things like visiting my nephew, washing my work clothes and participating in family dinners is hard. I think my depression is getting worse again. I am exhausted all the time, I am binge eating everyday and for the last few days I have been really sad, crying hysterically for hours at night and this morning I called in sick because I couldn't control my crying for hours and telling myself I wanted to die, couldn't sleep but wanted to and just not wake up. I don't know if I'm just tired and need to rest more during the weekends? My prac is only for another 11 weeks (done 4 already). How can I get through this. I've worked too hard to chuck in the towel.

a buoyant life tame of mortal body,

marching over to melancholia at its bugle call
then march through shadowy feelings

Im having a really bad day today my mood is so low and my thoughts are all over the place.
Ive also started taking meds at a different time of the day, not sure if thats anything to do with my being extremely depressed.
Sometimes we have triggers that can upset us and our moods,but I cannot think of anything, I feel like Im losing the fight. I have a beautiful family, great medical support, I feel like I should be doing better than I am.
Any advice would be so helpful, thanx BB for letting me vent.

I have been on medication for depression for 16 years now and at the moment I am really struggling with life. We may lose our home and the only job I can get is part time and doesn't cover our bills. I have a Doctors appointment on Monday but life has become hard. I am having to deal with the liquidator as well as run the home and I feel so alone even though my Husband is with me(he is coping ok. I am snapping on my kids and don't know if life will get better. I would love to get advise from anyone who has been in a similar situation. Thanks for reading my post x

This is my first post here.
I have had a number of issues with depression and anxiety since I was a child but recently I have been going through my worst episode.
I have been working in the same job for almost 7 years now, but over the past 2 years I have felt increasingly anxious and in the past few months depressed. I used to value my job, it was fulfilling but now just the thought of having to ""pretend"" and actually go to work fills me with an overwhelming sense of dread.
I have been prescribed medication to try and help & I have had sessions with my psychologist. I have also been referred to psychiatrists but as I live rurally I have been waiting 6 weeks for a full assessment.
In the past couple of days I find that I am beginning to feel detached from everything. It is much like watching my life on a screen being played out like a video game. I have gone to work, I have done the things that need to get done but I am working on autopilot, just watching it all be done & I don't like the feeling at all.
My psychologist suggested that I should just work part-time, while I consider options for a different career path. Which is easier said then done. My boss has been wonderfully supportive so far, but it's a small business and having to keep me on part-time & employ someone full-time for the duties I was fulfilling would drain the business. The only option I can see would be to resign. But then what? I would have no income and I can't really afford not to.
My mother is trying to be supportive too but to her it is all in my head & I just need to keep going to work and get over it.
Yesterday while driving to work I thought about how little I was actually paying attention to what I was doing and how I could easily have an accident & I honestly couldn't force myself to care about that. It would have meant I didn't have to go to work.

Do you blame yourself for the mistakes you've made? Do you feel guilty about them? Do you spent time dwelling about ""what could have been""?
I use to until I realised, that you are only responsible to limit our mistakes in the here and now. Once that decision making has been made, if it was the wrong one, it was only wrong after making it. But punishing ourselves year in year out is not clever, its responsive and harms us.
Eg For whatever reason I grew up impulsive problem I now dont have. Such a trait resulted in buying and selling 35 cars before the age of 23yo and as they were on loans I got myself into heaps of financial trouble. My family heard my justifications each new car I purchased, friends laughed but it was a serious issue.
As the years rolled by I dwelled on those impulsive years and beat myself up about them. But was it my fault? We end up as we are for a reason. In my case it could be I needed attention, needed change often, liked different cars in my driveway or got tired of one car quickly and desired another. Or my mothers BPD (undiagnosed) had its effect on us kids.
Whatever the real reason, it wasnt fault on my part. There is only fault when one doesnt learn and improve on the situation as best one can. As time went by I tried to keep a car for long periods. By 30yo I kept a car for 3 years, by 40yo 5 years and now my new csur purchased in 2008 I still have.
In my 20's my then girlfriend had had a baby adopted out when she was 16yo, 8 years earlier before I met her. We split after 6 years then met up 20 years later. She'd spent many a restless night dwelling on that one mistake, to give up her baby. I told her that under the same circumstances she would have done the same thing, she would bow to the pressures from family, no means to support her baby and the stigma from that era. Essentially, blaming herself was unfair. What would be more unfair is to not search for her child and help her child through life by knowing her birth mother.
We met up again 10 years later. She told me she found her child, now with children of her own. She had accepted it was unrealistic and hurtful to lay blame on herself for giving up her own baby. She has some lingering guilt, wished things were different and still takes medication for depression.
Importantly, her self blame has drifted.  
She is now an active granny. She progressed. 
Blame and guilt are suppressive thoughts that need to be contained. Be fair to yourself.

Hi ladies,
I am 41 and have many symptoms, sensations... I have recently been diagnosed with Anxiety/ mild depression.... but leading up to this diagnosis I had many symptoms, changes going on. I have just opened this thread in the hope of some advice of any other women out there that may have had similar symptoms/sensations or are able to tell me their stories.
I stopped the pill 11 months ago, since then my monthlys only last 3 days. My breasts are constantly sorer. I get period pains 1-2 weeks before my actual period. I get light headed, palpitations, mood swings, bloated, lower back pain, chest, neck, shoulder pain. I am a mystery... least I feel I am.
I was told by one Dr that I was oestrogen dominant, another Dr told me I wasn't.....
 
anyway, very confused. I look forward to hearing from any other ladies my age to see if they have similar things going o.

I’ve been struggling with depression for several years. My
husband walked out, I got retrenched, and I moved to a country town 3 years ago
for financial reasons. I’ve tried hard to join up and meet people, and many
people tell me I’m kind, funny and helpful; but I keep getting new rejections,
so it’s getting harder to maintain that façade. There are 3-4 people I’m on
friendly terms with, but they already have busy lives. I’m alone most of the
time, or at best alone –in-a-crowd.

Conversations are becoming impossible because everyone asks polite,
friendly questions that I’m unable to give a socially-acceptable answer to. 
“How are you?”. 
I should say “Good thanks!”, but that lie is becoming too difficult;
the real answer is “I’m so depressed I can hardly stand upright”, but it’s a
poor response to dump on most people. Is there an alternative?
Then there’s: “Do you work, are you retired?” I’m
unemployable, I’m supposed to do “volunteer” work for the dole but I got
bullied at the last place, and they asked me to leave because I got upset about
it. TMI.
“What have you been doing lately?” Sleeping half the day, struggling
to focus on anything the rest of the time. That’s a conversation-killer too.
“Do you have any holidays planned?” No, Centrelink doesn’t
let me have holidays, and I’m too weary to enjoy solo travel anyway.
And if they talk about themselves, it always seems to touch on my
own losses: they talk about their great marriage, their career, their holiday; or they
grizzle about dole bludgers who should be drug-tested. One person (I thought she was my oldest friend) has started telling me to be grateful
for what I have, because everyone has problems, and other people have it worse.
Probably true, but no longer helpful, and it feels like another rejection.
Being so alone is half my problem, but talking to people is
the other half, in all sorts of ways. I feel stuck. Is there any answer?

Hi everyone. This is my first post (I think...maybe I introduced myself some months ago?). I'm feeling pretty awful about myself, which is what has prompted me to get on here. 
I'm in my final semester of my second undergraduate degree. I'm 32 years old and haven't achieved anything in terms of a career or vocation. This degree was meant to be my 'second chance' for myself. Well...I've made a pretty terrible mess of it. I've realised I'm going to have to defer this semester because my project is going nowhere. I feel so totally inadequate next to my class mates, most of whom are a about a decade younger than me. They are so confident and clever and creative and I...just feel so stunted compared to them. I've spent the past five years - time that I wanted to dedicate to developing a fulfilling job path for myself - in a depressive fog. I made some feeble attempts to help myself but never followed through. Basically; I feel like a total failure, like I will just keep effing things up for myself time and time again. 
I do understand why I struggle. My father was very abusive. Most of it was emotional, some of it was physical, and I was always terrified of him. He was constantly berating me, telling me I was useless and stupid. Or acting as though I didn't exist. I think that many of the people I compare myself to have had much healthier upbringings (based on what they say about their relationships with their parents). But I can't help but feel very defective compared to them. And this is what is causing me the most distress at the moment; I see them accomplishing things that I would like to, but it feels so out of my reach because I don't feel worthy or deserving, and I believe I will never feel that way because of how I was treated in childhood. So I am feeling quite hopeless and 'what's the point' about a lot of things. 
I am seeing a psychologist (through my university) but I have been holding back in telling him what I am really thinking and feeling because I am a bit afraid he will somehow confirm that I am 'defective'. 
Thanks to those who have taken the time to read this. X

Hey all :) 

Personally I reckon yes and do talk openly for education, people won't understand unless they know of someone, experience it personally or hear about it. 
I have BP (Bipolar) type 1 & 2) So far to my face no one's been overly negative, not to say I don't cop grief from minority of people, but don't think it's cause of speaking up about it, moreso them letting there rot out on someone. Think sometimes I must have a bloody taget on my forehead. Still at least ya know who not to bum around with. 

You'd be surprised how many people once you open up a subject have something themselves or know of someone that suffers something that can be good learning and create support and understanding both ways. 

I know it's hard to open up, doesn't have to be to the world but we have lifes up & downs like everyone else but harder with MI or issues. We need support and understanding. 
Without education how else will people know. 

Be interested in your thoughts :) 

Hope yous are getting through the tough times, there is better than this and between us we can make it. WITH SUPPORT.

I as on here a month or so ago feeling really helpless, depressed and anxious due to health anxiety.  I had got on top of things for a few weeks and felt on top of the world.....  then it all come crashing down again!  I cannot pin point as to why this has happened but I cannnot cope with this all again!  All I want to do is lay in bed and sleep however my mind is in overdrive and will not allow me to sleep.  I don't want to eat or socialise with people.  The mornings are the worse for me as I don't know how I am going to get through the day.

Hey guys 👋🏼
 I'm new here so it's nice to read about all your discussions.
 Just needing some advice please. Currently looking for a job I can maintain and I just got offered a job as a case worker working with kids in foster situations with severe trauma and mental health issues. In one way, it sounds perfect as I love kids and helping people but I'm also worried that my depression isn't steady enough to go back to work as it does make me unreliable and especially in such an intense environment.
Have any of you had experience with this type of work or can you recommend any other work to me?
 I've tried being self employed but it's hard to stay motivated for me and not get discouraged with the lack of money.
 Thanks so much in advance ☺️

I have never been one to express my emotions and tend to bottle everything up, but I just need a place where I can express all the feelings I feel in a judgement free zone. I'm hoping this is the place. My recent move to Australia from the states has taken quite a large toll on my mental health, way greater than expected. I have felt so alone and am afraid to confide in my new found friends about my depression, homesicknesses, and the anxiety i get just thinking about going to uni. I have been purposely avoiding class so I don't have to participate because every time i think about speaking in front of classmates I can feel a panic attack coming on. Back in the states i suffered from this as well, but it was easier to stay in the comfort of my room and just forget about it . Here I am confronted with my thoughts and emotions every second of the day. I have felt so alone and like i'm not good enough recently. It has been affecting my sleeping and my eating habits. I want to be able to talk to my friends about it, even my friends and family back home, but I don't want to scare them away or make them think any less of me because of it. I don't even know how to go about bringing the topic up to them.
 *just needed a place to finally write down what I'm feeling and not have it bottled up inside*

Hi, I am new here.  I've reached a point in my life where I am starting to realise that if I keep going the way I am, then I will not likely live much longer.  I find myself frequently drinking very heavily and frankly I don't really know why.  I figure it is because of anxiety/depression but more than anything I think I have been doing it so long now that it has become habitual.  I don't actively search out alcohol, well not often anyway.  I just find myself buying alcohol and getting drunk.  I hate the way alcohol now controls me, but I also find there is not a lot out there for me.  AA i have tried, and that isn't for me.  I'd really like to go to rehab but I can't afford the time off work.  I'm seeing a doctor today for something else but will have a chat with them.  I want to find a solution to this, I just don't know what that is or if there is even one.  I don't want to die, I want to live and I want to start having a happy life.  Not this lonely, self destructing existence that it is now.

How do other people deal with maintaining a mask at work to deal with anxiety and depression? I struggle with the need to perform among extroverts. Last week I delivered two presentations on a new system that the audience couldn't care less about. They were rudely looking at their mobiles during the presentation and there were some technical issues as well which just left me feeling so anxious and afterwards so depressed. I also stumble over my words and I'm worried I won't be able to keep my job. On paper it's high status and high paying but my depression is making it one long struggle.

Hi...
I'm 17, turning 18 in two months or so and I think I have depression.
I've been called lazy for as long as I remember. And I've come to acceptit as who I am. But recently I'm starting to think it's something more than that. My parents allways tell me that ""I have an amazing memory"" but I have a terrible memory and everyone I've met recently has informed me thusly. So I think that i used to have a good memory and it's deteriorated.
 I never seem to be modivated to do anything and I think this is where the lazy stigma came from. I have countless television shows and books and whatever I want to watch or read. Countless things I say I'll do. But I don't, I stay inside, playing games on my computer. And even then I've caught myself talking myself out of wanting to play those games on multiple occasions. I can't even get a job. I want to work so bad. I want to be able to support myself but I keep forgetting to apply or talking myself out of it.
Recently there was an open day for a uni I wanted to go to... I didn't go.
I want to tell my parents. I want to be able to say ""I'd like to see a psychiatrist""...
But because I'm turning 18 and still don't have a job I'm terrorfied to ask more money from them...
I just don't know what to do...
I need help

Haven't we met before?- an amazing puzzle of Cluster B 
♡♡♡ The Borderline & Narcissist Couple ♡♡♡ - A great read I found on net & thought could be a subject of interest to  others & may want to share their thoughts.
As they say scratch a borderline & find a narcissist. Around one third of those with BPD also struggle with NPD. Individuals with this condition need near-constant affirmation, unique treatment and reinforcement of their own superiority. Part of narcissism is an inability to empathise with others. Sympathy is the ability to feel with or for another person, while empathy is the ability to put oneself in another person’s shoes and imagine life from their perspective. This is quite beyond the person with NPD. When you meet someone with NPD they may initially appear exceptionally confident, but this is a ruse. They will verbally inflate their own skills while minimising the contributions or abilities of others, but the truth is their arrogance is a mask for shatteringly low self-esteem. The narcissist is overly sensitive to any perceived slight and cannot bear with being directly or indirectly challenged by others as they are so desperately insecure. It’s easy to see how this could seriously aggravate the symptoms of interpersonal inadequacy that go with BPD. They can get together so well, there can be much acceptance but no peace. Borderline Outburts and Narcissistic Rage has many symptoms in common with narcissism. In fact, many psychiatrists believe BPD is the child disorder of NPD and hence the two disorders can overlap to large extent and can cause a lot of confusion in the diagnosis for the health professionals, spouses and partners of these people as they go from seemingly normal & ok and you start thinking well, maybe they aren’t a narc, maybe they were just having a bad day. As with anything in life, sometimes narcissism comes in shades of grey. In actual truth, the Narcissist is no match for the Borderline (rolling eyes). It doesn't matter how smart a narcissist is, someone with borderline is much more manipulative and keeps an upper hand & has the ability to turn narcissist's world upside-down to where a narcissist could lose his/her entire fortune, acquire a serious disease & literally become a shadow of his/her former self. Often in a relationship, the Narcissistic perfectionist believes; ""If I'm feeling bad in a relationship, it must be MY fault."" The Borderline believes; ""If I feel bad in a relationship, it has to be YOUR fault.""

Sometimes a think what's the use of me being here, I want to escape, leave everything behind me, I used to go out with my friends but now I make up excuses not to go.

This is my first ever post so here goes.
I'm married with kids but I feel so alone.
Ever since I was a teenager I've never felt good enough. I was given a hard time in high school and never felt like anyone really wanted me around. Nothing's changed. I have a couple of friends but no one really close and I've always felt on the outside, like if I wasn't around they wouldn't miss me anyway. 
i used to love my work but not anymore. A new employee started a year ago and she's just like all those high school bullies, sneaky and conniving and bitchy. She has talked me down to so many other employees that several have turned against me, it's like none of them can see what she is doing. High school all over again.
the last few days all I've done is put up a fake face when I'm around anyone and the second I'm alone I just cry.  I wish I could just pack up and leave it all behind but I adore my children, they are the only shining light in my life.
What the hell is wrong with me? Why can't I just pull myself together? Why don't I ever feel like I'm enough?
I feel so alone

Hi, 
I've had depression for a few years now, but only sought help at the start of the year. I've been on medication for 5 months now and there was a period where I was feeling do much better. 
Although in the last couple of weeks I feel like the meds have just stopped working. I've never been so sad in my life. I'm constantly excusing myself at work and going to the bathroom to cry. I don't want to kill myself, but I want to just hit pause on my life. I've thought about packing up my stuff and leaving for awhile. I'm struggling at work and constantly feel like I'm just waiting to get hone and lie in bed and cry. I've had enough of this. I want to be happy so bad. 
 Anyone experience the same after taking medication? Any advice?

I grew up thinking that my highly muted capacity for emotional response was just a personality trait. It took a double depresion episode in my 20s to realise otherwise. Sought treatment then, nothing worked, so I just tried to get on with things.
Hit my mid 30s, and my ahedonia became so pronounced I stopprd having feelings of reward or achievement often, or lastingly. Over the past 3 years, I've engaged a mental health team, but nothing we've tried's worked.
Aside from an occasional catostrophising and the odd moment of anxiety, there's not a lot for CBT to target. Talk therapy worked through some other issues hasn't provided any symptom relief.
On the psychiatry side, if you can name a drug, I've been on it. And if I've been on it, it has either had no effect or an abnormal one.
Exercise - also a bust. Joined a gym & a team sport, went to both regularly for a bit over a year.got into the best shape I've been in a decade & only felt worse because now I was depressed *and* phyically exhausted, without ever apparent benefit of exercise endorphins. Joined a community organisation for regular socialisation and do-good spirit; left bevause I'm one of nature's introverts and people are exhausting. I don't even get a lasting sense of good feelings from being with friends
What's left? What else should I try? I'm on the waiting list for tcm therapy but there don't seem to be any other treatment trials or research programs in WA. Even if I can't be fixed, knowing more aboit why I am the way I am would make things more bearable.

Today I have been diagnosed with bipolar.
im not really sure where to go from here. The doctor gave me some pills but I'm not sure what to do or who to talk to. 
Do I tell people or keep it to myself?

Hi All, Have had depression for around  ten years,It is envioromental depression if there is such a thing I don't think it is a chemical imbalance as there is no depression in the family that I know of altough my mother has high Anxiety and will never admit it ,she isn't good at admitting things I have to say, particularly the mental abuse we suffered and even at 53 still getting it today altough my sisters get far more now than I do as I don't see her much now, and avoid her like the plague but still get panic attack when I see it's her on the phone ,so damage done  too deep to just forget.Married a woman who is pretty much the same only with far more venom and we barely speak  and I have to end this marriage and soon or it will take me this time. I just have'nt the strength for the torrid battle it will be and she will use our son as a weapon against me that I can't avoid.It kills me he is 17 and is autisic and has the worst OCD that 3 doctors and 5 psycologists have ever seen (their words). he washes his hands 50 times a day is paranoid about germs and fumes so will not go out of the house without a major battle ,and has also a phobia about flies ,and we live in sydney  so summer is an absolute joy  as you can imagine.I am not on any meds as I was for 7 years and will not go down that road again ,have seen many psycologists with varying degree's of assistance ranging from little to none.One has been very helpful and very well known so when I watch tv I see her often I aso do her work I am a tradie so it is a little familiar and Fills me with shame when I think about how she must feel about me ,even thogh I know it isn't the case and I know it's just the ruminating thought patterns creating a false reality it still hurts me.I have hit a place where I haven't been before in as much as I don't want to go out and I don't want to exersize which I normally do crossfit 4 times a week and yoga twice a week I have just hit  a wall and feel paralized ,

I had a whole heap of friends that I kept in touch with, organised things with.I would be a recluse every now and then, but we would always be out and about. Travelling to Tassie, travelling to Canada, kayaking/canoeing Kangaroo Point river, driving to Darwin for wedding, having
dinners etc.  

Then things started to happen.  My depression smacked me hard and I was down for the count for some time.  My close friends were great, and even went to the community counsellor at the hospital to learn about depression, signs, what it means etc.  This buoyed me up – how lovely.  But I haven't really got better.  
I began to fall out of the loop.  People did not include me in the group invites or to the Christmas party.  Friends did not tell me that my other ‘friends’ were in a bad places (like 1 with stage III breast cancer; another whose parents died), so I just drifted backwards more and more.  This made me terribly sad – and made me feel very selfish as I wasn’t there to support them,which made me more distant as I didn’t know what to say (I know this is very self, self, self, but that is where I am at right now).

It's  difficult to describe but if you see and feel sadness in most things in life you could have dysthymia. Constant, uncontrollable crying, thinking often about sad topics.
A proper diagnosis  is needed. This illness generally develops prior to adulthood and can be described  as a constant low mood depression. You can google ""dysthymia mood disorder"" to receive a full description.
The disorder makes one feel alone, desperate and unusual. I have a friend I went to school with, he never cried in 35 years I knew him until his father died. He was uncontrollable that funeral day. The next day we chatted. I mentioned that his state the day before was how I felt every second day. He got some idea of the magnitude. Soon after I got the diagnosis
Bipolar2, depression, anxiety and...dysthymia. my psychiatrist discovered that a near drowning of my brother when I was 12yo was the spark, the shock that set it off. I didnt talk for 3 months after that incident  and was highly emotional ever since until 2009 when he prescribed medication.
Since then my life has turned around in terms of sadness. If you believe your level of sadness is high, constant and you feel desperate, even suicidal,  you might have dysthymia. It effects more women than men, can come about if you have a parent with a mental illness or if you suffered trauma at a young age.
Seek help. The difference to your life will be much more positive.

I gave up everything to be where I am now. But when I finally started to find a job and started work, it seems like nothing's going my way. I've considered changing profession but I don't want my family to be disappointed as they have high expectations. I feel like a failure all the time. I have trouble getting asleep and I wake up in the middle of the night for no reason. 
I just don't know what to do anymore.

I am really struggling.
I feel like I'm not enjoying being a mum. I love my daughter but I really strugle with the stress of it all.
I see a psychologist and I'm definitely doing better than I was but I am just wondering if I will ever be ""better"" or ""normal"" or ""me"" again.
I get so anxious in public situations especially if she is cranky or tired so I just avoid going out completely.
I keep wondering how the psychologist is going to fix me. I'm just a bit lost.

Is this just depression or am I right to feel this way?I hate humanity because I get pushed out of the way by selfish business men trying to board the train before me so they can get a seat.Because I was insulted and teased by strangers on the streets for being overweight and now being accused of a drug addict or told to eat more food because I worked hard to lose the weight and am now apparently too thin (I'm not).Because women on three occasions have thrown drinks at me from their car window and have shouted abuse. Even though I hate my body, and was a virgin when the events happened.Because I fianally worked up the courage to wear a dress for the first time and a man spat at me for wearing a dress. It was below my knees and I was wearing a jumper.And because a man once punched me in the shoulder because I walked too close to him.Because I feel lonely and other women walk past me giving me narky looks.Because I'm socially akward and people assume I'm dumb and condescend. Because a man once asked me if I was a prostitute while I was waiting for a bus. I know it sounds like I underdress but I don't.Because I dated a narcissistic man for six years who took all my money and my self respect.Because I survived high school not being seriously bullied but had my self esteem damaged by my mum when she was going through her mid kife crises and started to call me flthunder thighs before I even started gaining weight.Do I menifest this behavior from others because I don't love myself or something? Does anyone go through what I go through? I also hate the way people judge others in such a small minded way. I hate that people stare at their iphones all the time. I hate that they're addicted to technology.I hate that they take too many selfies and are self absorbed. I hate that they all follow trends no metter how ridiculous.I hate that people throw around mental illness and disorders like OCD, depression, bi polar, adhd, etc like they're meaningless adjectives. ""I'm tots OCD because I'm so neat"".I hate that people are fake to impress others.I hate that people are selfish in general.I hate people who use a instead of an.That's just my OCD.I know that there are diamonds in the rough. I wish there were more good people than there are bad. I don't want to hate humanity. I want to have fun in life.

Hi guys, 
I have been quietly struggling with depression, anger and mood swings since I was 18. What gets me the most when I feel depressed is the enormous sense of unbridled guilt. Guilt that my partner and my family have to put up with me on my bad days, and guilt that I'm depressed but don't have any valid and communicable reasons for it. I have a decent paying job and a loving partner and a supporting family. Not all that much bad has happened to me in life that warrants me being a depressed curmudgeon. My dad did die when I was in my early 20s and I did struggle with school early on (primarily because I was angry) which resulted in me dropping out really young. I did work through that though, so I thought, I went back to school accrued a couple of tertiary qualifications and found a loving partner.  On paper at least and in my own head I feel like there is just no rational reason for being depressed and I'm guessing this is why I feel incredibly guilty about it. 
I'm 29 and I just don't know what the right next steps are. Does anyone have any good tips about how to cope? Is this something that warrants professional help?

I need to say right at the start that I just need to get this off my chest.
I have anxiety, depression, bi-polar and I'm not coping...I'm over it. 
I don't want any more help...its not working.
Everything I do is impacting my family and my friends and all the strategies and sessions and meds are not working. Its all happening still and its impacting my family, my friends and my colleagues. Its not fair on them and I am over it. I don't know what to do and all I want to do is crawl into a corner and cry. I don't want to talk about it anymore, I don't those looks of sympathy, those looks of ""I don't know what to say"". I don't want to be included in the world anymore..i want to be me, away from everyone that I make frustrated and angry. I don't know what to do other than to write this down and get it off my chest. No one else I know is like this and I can't deal with professionals anymore.

Hi there everyone. I wondered if anyone had any experience with this. Last year I had an awesome adventure that I had been training for and planning for a long time. When I got back home and went back to work I crashed. I read some article last night about post adventure depression and it seems to describe what I am going through only all the articles say it only lasts a few weeks. I have been down since I got home in September.  I keep thinking and hoping that things will get better but there always seems to be something bad to bring me back down again.

I've dealt with depression since my teens but I always hid it well. I always smiled made jokes anything to make sure my family and friends didn't need to worry until it caught up with me and I became exhausted and couldn't put up the masks anymore. I've been on medication regularly for 4 to 5 years, But I can't seem to break the curse, lately it feels like it's gotten worse. 2 days ago I actually let myself do what I call a depression sleep. It's that sleep of mental exhaustion and the thought of getting up was too much to handle so I sleep the day away as my partner and our son were at work and school. We moved here so my partner could take a job at the university.  I'm originally from the US and thought I would pick up my career just as I did in the last country we lived in.I wrong, so I took a part time job below my skill set so I could get my masters degree, I finished last year and for the past year no job, not even in my own company. So I find myself trying to take more courses, apply for more jobs , my family is doing well here in Perth , I'm so proud of how my son is growing and how much enthusiasm my partner has , and I feel like what am I doing wrong?I find myself homesick quite often,envious of past colleagues, and find myself getting angry with the managers I work,all of I feel is just petty.Digging deeper, I've never not had a career since I was 18, my parents are not doing well and I can't send them my hard earned money I send my partners, my son isn't seeing what I hoped he'd be seeing which is a successful accomplished person, I feel as if I'm not wanted here, I've dealt with more bouts of bigotry here than I have in US or RSA and I struggle to not let it get to me but I hide it well cause I don't want my son to understand that part of life yet I want to protect his innocence as long as I can. I don't want my partner to know just truly how unhappy I am so I wait to he falls asleep so I can cry to sleep from exhaustion. I just want to blend into Perth and every day I tell my self that I just need to embrace it and I try. I don't give up the job search, I don't let the bigotry seap in, I do what I can to make sure my mom and dad know I love them and am doing my best, and I'm sorry I'm not the independent person that taught me to be, I tell my partner that what counts is that he loves his job because I want him happy. But I'm afraid my lows are coming back that I can't but on a mask of drama or laughter to hide. I just want to be happy.

Hey there, 
 This is my first post and it seems a bit strange to write to the ""unknown"". But here goes. 
 I am in my late 20s and I have a good life. I recently got married and I am finishing up my professional degree. I moved to a new country about 4 years ago and I think that's what started it all. I started my degree after years of hard work trying to get into it. Once i got started with the program I just wasn't into it but I could not figure it if i am generally not interested in life or if I just hated the way the program went. I even wondered if it was burn out. I started feeling really crap because I had no family and friends were hard to make. That's when I met my now husband. Things were awesome between us but I knew i was always feeling a bit low. But he gave me happiness and was a good distraction. 
Unfortunately he had to move to another city and we started doing the long distance thing. I think my symptoms got worse then. I started having anxiety attacks and was always so tired. I lived alone far from the city and was isolated. I couldn't move due to placements for my course and i was just getting further and further tired. I started taking my frustrations on him because he was just focused on work and he didn't understand anxiety.
 I don't understand why i wa anxious. I tried to stay positive and i went to gym regularly. I meditated and I read self help forums to do the right things. I kept my self busy and adapted to live alone. I tried to stay away from him so that he can work and not be bothered by me. We speak daily and meet once a month dor a weekend. I can't ask anynore but why am I missing him so much? It bothers me that he is able to handle the distance so much better, I just want to be like him. 
I am honestly now so tired to the point where I am just crying non stop some days. Everything seems like an effort even sending a small email. Tiny stressors get me wound up. I used to be such a go getter with so many things on at once and I never complained. Now I am such a mess. I break down to my partner and then end up feeling so foolish. I have started to hate myself and i don't know what to do. I have big exams and I cant get the energy to study well. 
 I sleep so poor and I can't seem to be in the moment.  I wake up feeling crap and tight chested and I have to spend energy fixing myself. 
 I feel a fool for this long message but can someone tell me how I can get my energy and my self back. I hate myself like this. Thanks

Not sure where to post this...
My daughter may be off to NZ on a school trip. It won't be until late next year and I've just put a deposit down. I think I need specific travel insurance incase she is not stable enough to go. If I cancel the trip now I still have to pay the whole $2800. 
I would like to be able to get specific mental health travel insurance so I don't lose money on the trip, also if she becomes unstable whilst on the trip she will be covered.
 Does anyone here have recommendations for travel insurance for mental health.
Thanks
